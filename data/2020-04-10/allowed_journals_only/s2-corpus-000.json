Using a simple example, we compare the usual mixed model BLUP to a similar predictor based on a mixed model framed in a finite population (FPMM) setup with two sources of variability, the first of which corresponds to simple random sampling and the second, to heteroskedastic measurement errors. Under this last approach, we show that when measurement errors are subject-specific, the BLUP shrinkage constants are based on a pooled measurement error variance as opposed to the individual ones generally considered for the usual mixed model BLUP. In contrast, when the heteroskedastic measurement errors are measurement condition-specific, the FPMM BLUP involves different shrinkage constants. We also show that in this setup, when measurement errors are subject-specific, the usual mixed model predictor is biased but has a smaller mean squared error than the FPMM BLUP which point to some difficulties in the interpretation of such predictors.","inCitations":["4bfe95c4ff443269f96315cf8384ec31c5ae93f3","2c291a757876220a2596097ceca66b2d1ea50524"],"title":"Prediction with measurement errors in finite populations.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2011.10.013"}

Often, it is combined with cross-validation in order to assess how the results will generalize to an independent data set. In order to evaluate the quality of an estimate for cross-validated AUC, we obtain an estimate of its variance. For massive data sets, the process of generating a single performance estimate can be computationally expensive. Additionally, when using a complex prediction method, the process of cross-validating a predictive model on even a relatively small data set can still require a large amount of computation time. Thus, in many practical settings, the bootstrap is a computationally intractable approach to variance estimation. As an alternative to the bootstrap, we demonstrate a computationally efficient influence curve based approach to obtaining a variance estimate for cross-validated AUC.","inCitations":["a8c7e7e82cefd34a835a310b7ecc6ce3e50303d2","cba1f0d380c45b368e5df7039a0b63505c20539c","d6698efe3ee0c43246b6d2703784f6e57cac2020","0a74cb483639dbe01cfcdfae28fa5d97e69e4086","1b17a4ed3b33181298eb8917c598c880b3f847cc","8f08e613a1c9a97a43d52d644af92ef19a3a0e28","e87d8ef9e20130844554c6898f96204057c17168","9e9c525700cb643617800d66357c0f443fa6d16a","8963209b68bc27ebe9f0be41e5ecf7659b46aa42","5cb1372108caf3e094165bc57222cdc5c4ca9207","c5f2386b4fef0c785b5fd239b670d36e3060cbae","b59c91bd7aaeb31ad51e0ecbc4c5cccc715573e2","a8675d110368abb13a400dbfc596b7443963e016","b124306de4591c50ed40f1eb8663553e30ddd71a","f736d5b07515fd47b989b1246894460ded90cb7d","1c3b561a708e32ce47a0d83da6246e1553d7c6c3","94c0ad62baa6e27f215d32912c4d2ef0e4437c89","d1c9b262b6bd4ba22aa2dc19f1c77a8a8d0ad250","9b06e5faab6ecadc69f954b35570eb310b1a8684","584a2227af5d759d25c22ce098eca3c41aa2225d","a0408230aff1b4c178e07504ba24aa31718e99ad","e051993d2056b24834124d3b3cfe4dc31addbe02","9bc57e3d8847ba6f23def295dfecf9da80fafa3d","b151d9ab437f8b632c3594da36d2015ac9567a90","66363088a019f69ce7781fb1b0e412d67cb319de","4933a9bb6d0a35d45c15363fecff85d218c9b4ed","b9b0ecf334a07fc284762201aeb566dacb05f54d","7406b59baced21f39354f6429630e08dca7b6442","dbe6e601a07bbb013a40bb6d4773803cb6f889ed","ee8bfc8fda329da6e74981d2e59a95c7a0e854ae","9d75a5fbb31e6e44fc71aa06777c90dc9ef1ca07","91b6ee75e740712a50f07e35eaf9c16a918dd04d","040eadcf21401174bab5465136c28c1684ca83a6","b91dfbdda0bec4e0b2d528e35ed5267af334e6b2","a7ef515278142c30aa24a756a853890e3ddb0862","e7468c8697621eaeb25873b5143d4c6ba3a5cde7","d0595aecf945faab3fb5fbfff51a117ed4d78299","a6a272962372c02dc276c74eaf4c27bae68c045e","03f95ee31e0171a7951b8f0cc36dbc02172e4c76","0b262199c29c98df787d5d78e2356f54d5c0244a","be0d2824e4d5cfb60f75678f216f0695811d60e8","6fc7a2f3864f8796cd3bfafd22fba0ff8797cbe1","9fbe1a48d41efc156d76d7a148a80d15b3466597","b40d59e9871a74ace646b59368a51d05e8f39076","51bffe3e8da409f0d26611defc9e461718c428fb","e78d57991ef003c5533235149a69f1ca8edb4a73","5151c5597ec87dd72a9f9f56806e207da4bbde90"],"title":"Computationally efficient confidence intervals for cross-validated area under the ROC curve estimates.","doi":"10.1214/15-EJS1035"}

At the same time, patterns of genetic diversity confound efforts to determine the genetic basis of complex disease. Due to technological advances, it is now possible to measure hundreds of thousands of genetic variants per individual across the genome. Principal component analysis (PCA) is routinely used to summarize the genetic similarity between subjects. The eigenvectors are interpreted as dimensions of ancestry. We build on this idea using a spectral graph approach. In the process we draw on connections between multidimensional scaling and spectral kernel methods. Our approach, based on a spectral embedding derived from the normalized Laplacian of a graph, can produce more meaningful delineation of ancestry than by using PCA. The method is stable to outliers and can more easily incorporate different similarity measures of genetic data than PCA. We illustrate a new algorithm for genetic clustering and association analysis on a large, genetically heterogeneous sample.","inCitations":["87ccd3e61d2a70794a65fac03f158b90d867d3d2","54b886cd3d2c957293c1223409acd62147acee3a","4a0770c7ff35c75c48bf5161d7ceff0dbbbe7387","0af3e4ee068e9decd125d4d0266d7fa1798c626c","acd375e4bbe813183c4f79bf27e316f9d7ec97b6","b04f10ae71d0922666b8a6cab6a636861375a7ee","bd2bc3e2787d26d497055f9fdf2d0590f53769fe","2655956b9202cac10c5837337a7d94d5afd73a54","ca9b28536b137929abd39a539e68505e8039d12b","bb092ca38bd391a6765d30aa8a4e341e4be646c8","90a38b2bee60d8448fbbc61e64de7b0a17b03e12","496f4927f236aa4c5ba2cdf6750f98d9b852cc4b","42da459d0340748ffa7608c18220ce086887b80e","f71226df46641ea0f40712efc0a7eb1389cba1d6","7084fbc8252bc7e5abbd74c5bfe78cce749cf839","313bc4b1e75826bcacd19aebe683c28aa29f4800","7465c83cf182f19d57226b5d319c17404875b25e","987c0210d305edc5f30d8c597ecdb0a0974df121"],"title":"A Spectral Graph Approach to Discovering Genetic Ancestry.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS281"}

Using adult sex crime arrestee data from 1990 to 2005, the the idea of Central Mean Subspace (CMS) is extended to intervention time series analysis (CMS-ITS) to model the sequential intervention effects of 1995 (the year SC's SORN policy was initially implemented) and 1999 (the year the policy was revised to include online notification) on the time series spectrum. The CMS-ITS model estimation was achieved via kernel smoothing techniques, and compared to interrupted auto-regressive integrated time series (ARIMA) models. Simulation studies and application to the real data underscores our model's ability towards achieving parsimony, and to detect intervention effects not earlier determined via traditional ARIMA models. From a public health perspective, findings from this study draw attention to the potential general deterrent effects of SC's SORN policy. These findings are considered in light of the overall body of research on sex crime arrestee registration and notification policies, which remain controversial.","inCitations":["14d6bfdf826d9144394d985a10668de3b44930b2","da02369ce4a45757ec63b46c8996b04c46c52cd5"],"title":"Examining deterrence of adult sex crimes: A semi-parametric intervention time-series approach","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2013.08.004"}

Current gene network modeling is primarily based on the use of Gaussian graphical models applied to continuous data, which give a closed-form marginal likelihood. In this paper, we extend network modeling to discrete data, specifically data from serial analysis of gene expression, and RNA-sequencing experiments, both of which generate counts of mRNA transcripts in cell samples. We propose a generalized linear model to fit the discrete gene expression data and assume that the log ratios of the mean expression levels follow a Gaussian distribution. We restrict the gene network structures to decomposable graphs and derive the graphs by selecting the covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution with the hyper-inverse Wishart priors. Furthermore, we incorporate prior network models based on gene ontology information, which avails existing biological information on the genes of interest. We conduct simulation studies to examine the performance of our discrete graphical model and apply the method to two real datasets for gene network inference.","inCitations":["94c19ee06cee851171661e3457d95a6f82770077","6489bcb76d823e20c44d428c147f0dd8a5cdaa00","28f108b4939afc6602c827622d87046ee179c523","aa9d07a8a83038f6b2a6eaed12012200a1aa4ef5","b80aba310af293225f607f2f33f2e0c2b051190a","d7c969cd163ed488e64dcaa52782c935e0d2f56c","3142418c2c58cdbb072615d9e021bb33f2c3c715","93bb9ae734266d5bbc9fd1b2f3cfbd94eb748141","72f3e4642231cbf9db3df3a31c69a21f3b746b49","4a65a734231c44125579c9b13a3c7a44a35af222","a626e644a665cf571a481f39c9d0c8c922127625","9c6de4191eae7167cd237deb42db9087540b3a3a","19a38b166f763c1cad3fe2d3322e1a089db01953"],"title":"Inferring gene networks from discrete expression data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt021"}

In this article, we propose a new class of semiparametric mean models that allows for the interaction between the observation history and covariates, leaving patterns of the observation process to be arbitrary. For inference on the regression parameters and the baseline mean function, a spline-based least squares estimation approach is proposed. The consistency, rate of convergence, and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are established. Our new approach is different from the usual approaches relying on the model specification of the observation scheme, and it can be easily used for predicting the longitudinal response.

We develop a derivative-free algorithm GRIMA to accurately approximate π by interpolation over its high-probability density (HPD) region, which is initially unknown. Our local approach reduces the waste of computational budget on approximation of π in the low-probability region, which is inherent in global experimental designs. However, estimation of the HPD region is nontrivial when derivatives of π are not available or are not informative about the shape of the HPD region. Without relying on derivatives, GRIMA iterates (a) sequential knot selection over the estimated HPD region of π to refine the surrogate posterior and (b) re-estimation of the HPD region using an MCMC sample from the updated surrogate density, which is inexpensive to obtain. GRIMA is applicable to approximation of general unnormalized posterior densities. To determine the range of tractable problem dimensions, we conduct simulation experiments on test densities with linear and nonlinear component-wise dependence, skewness, kurtosis and multimodality. Subsequently, we use GRIMA in a case study to calibrate a computationally intensive nonlinear regression model to real data from the Town Brook watershed.

In such situations, the Kaplan-Meier estimator is typically used with an asymptotic confidence interval (CI) that can have coverage problems when the number of observed failures is not large, and/or when testing the latter parts of the curve where there are few remaining subjects at risk. The BPCP guarantees central coverage (i.e. ensures that both one-sided error rates are no more than half of the total nominal rate) when there is no censoring (in which case it reduces to the Clopper-Pearson interval) or when there is progressive type II censoring (i.e. when censoring only occurs immediately after failures on fixed proportions of the remaining individuals). For general independent censoring, simulations show that the BPCP maintains central coverage in many situations where competing methods can have very substantial error rate inflation for the lower limit. The BPCP gives asymptotically correct coverage and is asymptotically equivalent to the CI on the Kaplan-Meier estimator using Greenwood's variance. The BPCP may be inverted to create confidence procedures for a quantile of the underlying survival distribution. Because the BPCP is easy to implement, offers protection in settings when other methods fail, and essentially matches other methods when they succeed, it should be the method of choice.","inCitations":["a05a7ee67bb9ed547e9fce6f633340e7926f5361","39836d2ba8d8fb13bf24ffc4dc665cdebae454f2","5c7eb4723011b048d4342c574feced177f7cd68f","919e2ae2c4638976d55f996d29a9db1e8bf05079","b47d22d7ee02371b79ed269e18c5b4d0cb37a364","7dc84169fb54f8df3f68f75ed2ac56b82db6ca02","2458f780d9e686d8139e9df1a1a3c640064642b9","04cb78119cd17ca25184f8e4c921798b70e1ee15"],"title":"Pointwise confidence intervals for a survival distribution with small samples or heavy censoring.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt016"}

The SSVS method has previously been applied to linear and generalized linear mixed models, and to the proportional hazards model with high dimensional data. Because the method has mainly been developed for hierarchical normal mixture distributions, it operates on the linear predictor under the Cox type models. The PHMM naturally incorporates the normal distribution via the random effects, which enables SSVS to efficiently search through the candidate variable space. The approach was evaluated through simulation, and applied to a multi-center lung cancer clinical trial data set, for which the variable selection problem was previously debated upon in the literature.","inCitations":["1668d5410d6f80390605eade1c59498c1904f4e9","66266e4899e3fa2ba74869ccf4d2fa4951a5d156"],"title":"Bayesian variable selection under the proportional hazards mixed-effects model","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2014.02.009"}

HRMSMs allow investigators to analyze the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome based on a fixed, shorter and user-specified history of exposure compared to MSMs. By default, the latter represent the treatment causal effect of interest based on a treatment history defined by the treatments assigned between the study's start and outcome collection. We lay out in this article the formal statistical framework behind HRMSMs. Beyond allowing a more flexible causal analysis, HRMSMs improve computational tractability and mitigate statistical power concerns when designing longitudinal studies. We also develop three consistent estimators of HRMSM parameters under sufficient model assumptions: the Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighted (IPTW), G-computation and Double Robust (DR) estimators. In addition, we show that the assumptions commonly adopted for identification and consistent estimation of MSM parameters (existence of counterfactuals, consistency, time-ordering and sequential randomization assumptions) also lead to identification and consistent estimation of HRMSM parameters.","inCitations":["8ba1234c0c067d816d546aca66c6af4903c44451","9a597dd529f5f14ced3a59f7daf59f3d2e3304b9","09782d702be53229cb41293a735ab0386b0eaf30","22961171a8911770fef87a2928c6724613d74249","68ac14b6127138ec4416bf13e5f839932827de1b","7d9969e2cf64c731f0a5a857e5e219d828e961ed","7aae2292e7ea7c2571bcfc77a923b49623402fa5","f51e48b59c60ef9ce4ea722a95b260488667dbfe","a8a2f20037080282ffcd0a6cf8bfd29a60087461","646396749b27926e605a25241e78a189f1d693c2","a2ec6298127ee632b5ae6b967ac25def55fc8f08","4385ba945e21bc8de566afa687f9cc2874e204e8","9d26ad4404b4afecbb62e991a74f1726106906db"],"title":"Causal inference in longitudinal studies with history-restricted marginal structural models.","doi":"10.1214/07-EJS050"}

The use of D-optimality in the first stage is primarily to allow best possible parameter estimates as one enters the second stage. However, it is important to understand that there are many ways to formulate the two-stage procedure. It may involve any optimality criterion in either stage. In fact, theoretically, one need not stop at two stages. It was our intention in this paper to demonstrate the potential in the two-stage procedure in cases in which good initial parameter estimates are not available. Those investigators who are interested in the software for the two-stage procedure described here should contact Dr. William R. Myers.","inCitations":["66ed6c4e6bfd4542247ef68056f8b40d4f794e6d","669cee39ff18e71ce21163240d1095f98dc82055","704a388db00add5ea8c9bfa37e84760b17bd0466","5e1545cb3f581be2084ef5aa9a04c148aa008ad7","1abfdc93a1be576cd3a64f27f3ea8ae7d66c05d4","1d69eb6602c52e26bcd4368744a50e87ce18f580","3007f276b7f3b882e6802c2d875ae35c1ff0f2e5"],"title":"Two-stage designs for the logistic regression model in single-agent bioassays.","doi":"10.1080/10543409608835144"}

After reviewing the single-study case, we use data from five trial protocols to look for units that tend to have treatment effects consistently above or below the study-specific grand mean across several studies. As a first step, we summarize the patient-level data as study-specific and unit-specific estimated treatment effects and standard errors using independent Cox regression models. We then compare the results of a hierarchical model using these data summaries as input to those produced by a more fully Bayesian method that uses the actual patient-level survival data. We also compare various different models using a deviance information criterion, a recent extension of the Akaike information criterion designed for hierarchical models. Our procedure appears to be effective at answering the question whether certain clinical units of the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS are better than others at identifying treatment effects where they exist.","inCitations":["2941e5991e400ac3aaaafb71f473b8d495cb1d3d"],"title":"Cross-study hierarchical modeling of stratified clinical trial data.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101199"}

Adjusting for baseline covariates could potentially increase the estimation efficiency of negative binomial regression. However, adjusting for covariates raises concerns about model misspecification, in which the negative binomial regression is not robust because of its requirement for strong model assumptions. In some literature, it was suggested to correct the standard error of the maximum likelihood estimator through introducing overdispersion, which can be estimated by the Deviance or Pearson Chi-square. We proposed to conduct the negative binomial regression using Sandwich estimation to calculate the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates together with Pearson overdispersion correction (denoted by NBSP). In this research, we compared several commonly used negative binomial model options with our proposed NBSP. Simulations and real data analyses showed that NBSP is the most robust to model misspecification, and the estimation efficiency will be improved by adjusting for baseline hypoglycemia.","inCitations":["1ce4ef69c46dffbb7fbcad3dbc924d1742139f7f","a4478f150a6ec542273132a8e3133db43df36372","292a196694afa01ff072f5983b1da299eb14190a","eb97f9046b7505e58301ce1e2026f95739f9bc9f","5c7eb582b40e4ae8e59e3f175abde5a69bf83606","70e5606eebc5288adaf7568a126e3f6c18ce425c"],"title":"Analysis of hypoglycemic events using negative binomial models.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1576"}

However, the existing theory and computer packages are developed mainly under the assumption of normality, and hence cannot be satisfactorily applied to non-normal and ordered categorical data that are common in behavioural, social and psychological research. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach to the analysis of structural equation models in which the manifest variables are ordered categorical and/or from an exponential family. In this framework, models with a mixture of binomial, ordered categorical and normal variables can be analysed. Bayesian estimates of the unknown parameters are obtained by a computational procedure that combines the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Some goodness-of-fit statistics are proposed to evaluate the fit of the posited model. The methodology is illustrated by results obtained from a simulation study and analysis of a real data set about non-adherence of hypertension patients in a medical treatment scheme.","inCitations":["9df6d598cfbdb7377c947e7f985f3f483c70ffbe","89ab7f5a5ce952729a99367117f0837b352aae75","50d21e214afc5c4c4c77fe0c7e74ebc78cc83998","5f88f31187ed5382fc6e150402c179ffa087cef0","23a680b66c4077d24f9e8a44f3cf23a187009d51","0cd785fe4a31281b93b2c240d956ed30a4ba49a9","94fc1b1b3dd3159218413c97e65c3017bf5bcaa5"],"title":"Bayesian analysis of structural equation models with mixed exponential family and ordered categorical data.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X81403"}
