Since the derivation of formal statistical procedures for testing the associated hypotheses is more or less straightforward, it is surprising that the approach was pursued in a systematic manner not earlier then in 1990 [by Anderson and Hauck and Wellek]. In discussing the relative merits of the approach we will stress the importance of a careful understanding of its conceptual basis. It will be argued that the most severe limitation on the usefulness of such probability-based criteria of individual bioequivalence arises from the fact that large intraindividual formulation discrepancies provide evidence against equivalence only in definite absence of period effects.","inCitations":["d49f9ec8be916bb04b12e5a30924cd7ae62bb843","868c4616939b89a85a775c7fe695bfdee2651d14"],"title":"A comment on so-called individual criteria of bioequivalence.","doi":"10.1080/10543409708835164"}

This often leads to the conduct of large clinical trials to identify small average treatment benefits for heterogeneous groups of patients. Drugs that demonstrate effectiveness in such trials may subsequently be used broadly, resulting in ineffective treatment of many patients. New genomic and proteomic technologies provide powerful tools for the selection of patients likely to benefit from a therapeutic without unacceptable adverse events. In spite of the large literature on developing predictive biomarkers, there is considerable confusion about the development and validation of biomarker based diagnostic classifiers for treatment selection. In this paper we attempt to clarify some of these issues and to provide guidance on the design of clinical trials for evaluating the clinical utility and robustness of pharmacogenomic classifiers.","inCitations":["c930e691e41249d8d06cc659c5c34e64e947b0b8","615be7c2cf64fa06fe48a4c16bb8108b4d5b9152","87c33fbfdd06190345c843173c0c7459b608eab6","116708c9583d43369b37816bbdc7e7ec8a293dd3","72a9610f37510e4dc8a12d79ce02cb7a5733187a","4ce673f5472fe6e10d7a3f781fc069f784dd08fe","1ca6c20a9e8750a17a3c1b8dbec5619f228eb469","2733104bba2da24a0012d08b01c311d0fdb33f57","0b8e5a3ea54c6a2699d2705e2298adb6a381af88","cb6e9297083debd06eac044ecf0a51311dae872f","b9f76139ff4d4b30b0afa2864d1feabf6367d419","7a925eeb5e136a12b90c25467068f1d4d5f3b4d4","a31b0a253b9360d76168b3957e60c2db19fc9384","5eaa41798a6229675a0ee6e53689d9f4e04abe27","6850ea7af4a5e6d3a8d402da2ddad19946921a11","c4e0269b6c7623087eb151ab6753f1ab24e1f401","241c54d08513f1c08ca7dfbc56df0a78b970f0e7","574d3c60d478859b7b5ce988e3fa98a099141a01","de8311837c4df9fc0ee2be8ae66f97d86007ce73","49559690266220a81735d5808993cae26e8ab752","89532b1e10a7f99cfc8fad0f83cfbdad4b56f000","3cb21157f334b2fd660785ef0961edd90ec704b3","b7207c5fa41755449350061dd5b8903a60aea77d","a1c99ffbaa65dcd4e3bea49346d12bc6a200f3f7","3259e8682ded7e81ec2ab33a235982f9450c27f3"],"title":"Development and Validation of Biomarker Classifiers for Treatment Selection.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2007.06.010"}

One area of activity is in creating smoothed disease maps to describe the geographic variation of disease and generate hypotheses for apparent differences in risk. With multiple diseases, a multivariate conditionally autoregressive (MCAR) model is often used to smooth across space while accounting for associations between the diseases. The MCAR, however, imposes complex covariance structures that are difficult to interpret and estimate. This article develops a much simpler alternative approach building upon the techniques of smoothed ANOVA (SANOVA). Instead of simply shrinking effects without any structure, here we use SANOVA to smooth spatial random effects by taking advantage of the spatial structure. We extend SANOVA to cases in which one factor is a spatial lattice, which is smoothed using a CAR model, and a second factor is, for example, type of cancer. Datasets routinely lack enough information to identify the additional structure of MCAR. SANOVA offers a simpler and more intelligible structure than the MCAR while performing as well. We demonstrate our approach with simulation studies designed to compare SANOVA with different design matrices versus MCAR with different priors. Subsequently a cancer-surveillance dataset, describing incidence of 3-cancers in Minnesota's 87 counties, is analyzed using both approaches, showing the competitiveness of the SANOVA approach.","inCitations":["ae6932c8600794d2e2ededb620b9742aef9aef07","24e77811909fbd61efeac0f66dd63beec2fb8d5b","6aa2d27f4db005baea4112854d07b30bcd3209ea","25698da613aa282148b8484d5c2f32712dd88278","478532a02115ae85bd69166b2817a68ea7c60094","10e2e7c02b3173817069d837c017c475f85fee77","cd0b36f119142f97098f57a4df9dac528cedc233","d11d9aea4a291348a0d848c767f3170f3ff9c026","605c5d1d2daccf6c2501b45d6c75d0d6070bc8b7","05186498a81c026e6112f3b38cebcac2b1a6a211","f7e962ad6c19fdb0b1f2c40354653ca5ce085bfe","76b09fbd1f4a543f3d752403c269e7152426459f","e550b6bbc9353b64efe6e66490c63ad72a45e823","eca8c3c3d9e4964e49163c929b01f98e53cb65de","88063d2cb19824f72b00a7e2da2d6b315afcae5d"],"title":"Smoothed Anova with Spatial Effects as a Competitor to Mcar in Multivariate Spatial Smoothing.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS267"}

It is demonstrated that the detection proportion and the bacterial density cannot be estimated separately, not even in a multiple dilution experiment. Only the product can be estimated, changing the interpretation of the most probable number estimator. The asymptotic power of the likelihood ratio statistic for comparing an alternative method with the compendial method, is optimal for a single dilution experiment. The bacterial density should either be close to two CFUs per test unit or equal to zero, depending on differences in the model parameters between the two test methods. The proposed strategy for method validation is to use these two dilutions and test for differences in the two model parameters, addressing the validation parameters specificity and accuracy. Robustness of these two parameters might still be required, but all other validation parameters can be omitted. A confidence interval-based approach for the ratio of the detection proportions for the two methods is recommended, since it is most informative and close to the power of the likelihood ratio test.","inCitations":["955ec0c5e6cca14f54c327c4250c034be8b35ee9"],"title":"Validation of qualitative microbiological test methods.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1663"}

The \"normexp\" method models the observed pixel intensities as the sum of 2 random variables, one normally distributed and the other exponentially distributed, representing background noise and signal, respectively. Using a saddle-point approximation, Ritchie and others (2007) found normexp to be the best background correction method for 2-color microarray data. This article develops the normexp method further by improving the estimation of the parameters. A complete mathematical development is given of the normexp model and the associated saddle-point approximation. Some subtle numerical programming issues are solved which caused the original normexp method to fail occasionally when applied to unusual data sets. A practical and reliable algorithm is developed for exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using high-quality optimization software and using the saddle-point estimates as starting values. \"MLE\" is shown to outperform heuristic estimators proposed by other authors, both in terms of estimation accuracy and in terms of performance on real data. The saddle-point approximation is an adequate replacement in most practical situations. The performance of normexp for assessing differential expression is improved by adding a small offset to the corrected intensities.","inCitations":["4e6a484caf4669ef27984717a7188e1dca358349","c17a720f1e6e1cebce0d356fe5b4e13a5e2d5196","ca89b2e62b437539db68d2d688c5a4c793cf4a0c","e8eb666dbd4eb6afef4b0c38ab554c60bca6d786","2ac97fa41f8457eabadce58fa8b24f34196b8c9e","fc4c6344bb224795919a2e3ce4b23afb6d684c72","3de4c8982e5fa8a4a99027721cb931c9ce041398","598f32b50944818efbbf5822ce3d19d02e74a73a","71a97fb439d7094e030302d834230db235e1b53f","dc70c4bb5bc6aadec8edd6cb03134cc03ad80d42","6920c655887e6be1b8e819a4f2dcc63d6516f67a","1df01b138b08a75442c3cb0cbe8e0b68078779d9","c90e0e0c7fcd79a59eabff5fb8d19b842d3f6847","88b1b58b435450bd038381614cc00058f8ba3d52","4ff06c9097fd078eb73f568062c698ffc656c4a2","787e3da7193ae33f79291ba947991cf2e4ba0142","3c06ada42bc356ae595799eb32af3f96d82f518e","03546fe0fb1a6087165b8d8af6ace435a58dd43a","a724c3f5349596f887d54277ba87eb190c3c583b","126a8102182ebaed57bd8b62be32729d278747ec","19782ab6b108c697c60054faa407311017f5d17f","28973faa111851242e5cba4f167631731511565c","3a91ce3ea791c5eec951b54ba9fa305aa54db7d2","8e30aefb822c9391e4ff54d92fc698f4a65f2643","bd66964e0fccb72e6e2c08ae5b36b740d8f6841b","54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532","7b246f8feb7f2391ff8f21e35a0570dd19b5d24d","d9cee1b2f7b6ddc45c65cc6fe63211991bc8bc63","4cbf2b0c94b609b698f6f82c88c8747be33397a0","1a4edf364f32de0d660b858103f713e20b7d3888","9aa95ed255e443e2ba8ae13196dd3602bced875d","3ca390adebd93b56199b318f3d7b86368f9b0dc4","bd34180865c88fea72cd3645d8455f230aa4d5ba","eaefe7ca902554a7dd4af2efb5351b3d562e3797","be22eb379b133b2393066931b61507659538f88f","eca2e6fed5856db810e849ebaf419cdf0241316e","0b415b940597e2ca87cda46c95bdbac44b60504c","6c97450c45e1338974fb542e32472a419e6c5002","a82f0df759e77e17560714bec3bcfbe777a779eb","86fb7ae2771d3a8e8bd6c270fbbb8e7f01d353b8","6e8822cb7d46d7a30f64eb106b4bbb8374c6859b","e120e09d86538cba55ca91d84a522abfd41c0efe","9b9417522752fa4a87fe5f39ab3ef354688f06e2","e839a80f1593cd7732a7b0f0fc01195c3881d357","09d1c30cfd7a8461b347a6ef45cb6b885bc8af4c","7eb3e9fada6b969bc3ec6938646a04fa8c93fc1a","06f6e680919167633d50d0a0e870f19110b84a8e","748833285f17c828004154379a3c463e84b07929","92cbb94d5071c828e1bf77ea22496a4758445f3f","667e4f10b0eada5d55a38ca386179280ca822b7c","0dcd850780667a9f71111b56893f0dbef4e004bb","48e9a8b8b8b702f1ef5f980e4b0f069219a654a2","28cbcd3a5eca4d5eebb4a1a1d44577e4744fa550","df7bdf5cfcdb1064e11fd5809f8897695daa8ed7","60a63c674219dce1737904fb2da494f487a08453","0c6dea5cf5d5e0249d28d1175784e70392c1b0b8","05d9a03afb5a7cb9ab580b642fce99cb8aec79bb","1190c2f663445dd1f19ca4a892440e03fcf71e61","fb05714cdbcc08817509bb719c8b2f2ba6a34836","0449ae032125f011cf8743889f0feda728edc46f","8628ca32c0d4d87dcb9f48437fc0cab7468f86b4","c62ae5438e53c324cf65c90a682208fd51e3ce2f","09bd19362956dd346058bbc8d5fc403f28b75e7d","28594801efa50e145e5df60064645f84b2d5770b","713877ff15f7ef40bbdc699e981685d067e04b89","54a911d3b02eb01f6d7f7e01c2ac38499ad05725","123735ba6b216259e41c58c675ca42fe758cca9d","470d5ea94f899157b5bcce48d43a6f7490b601aa","8abafc86f7d229b9a9b89e3759a5d780d23397b7","3301ab42184f2564b125c289e51b584ddb3b9c36","64c481a6e08ac60625daee793e534a2f1956df50","551f8bd983238f8261a81cfee34a48331684bcdd","d9177a6985caf4140d12aac562eb4f10d5b5366f","e9a082f4bab7ca22dbd5499662445b0cf18cf1ec","460faffb87da514e6ecacd4253b8ef80250d6dce","58c1a47fa1702007fcd257ec0d5f62c7fea55275","612c1c532b819751da1e7b0bbe21b22b0593f8b0","dbf136dd09deebcdcdd41e8d6ccdb75bc9028e6b","9ffc6509427d5c8843add56c857688d092380eff","429e2772645335e845a88b30c87deec11030b3ad","3042ee38215d907b2a4617ceefc787a39530aca2"],"title":"Microarray background correction: maximum likelihood estimation for the normal–exponential convolution","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn042"}

We propose a scalable two-stage iterative true group ICA methodology for analyzing population level functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data where the number of subjects is very large. The method is based on likelihood estimators of the underlying source densities and the mixing matrix. As opposed to many commonly used group ICA algorithms, the proposed method does not require significant data reduction by a 2-fold singular value decomposition. In addition, the method can be applied to a large group of subjects since the memory requirements are not restrictive. The performance of our approach is compared with a commonly used group ICA algorithm via simulation studies. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to a large collection of resting state fMRI datasets. The results show that established brain networks are well recovered by the proposed algorithm.","inCitations":["d43973947b4eac8ddca6587d2d7ae6cc2a170164","79baf8fdb934018c90f51ea4b3868fc46378217c","e2884fac6bcb06353928b7917b816f4b7b67bea4","242d135b8fca12444dc86b2a212ad29f04b09e9f","8ebed838837b4bd9d7375585ada4a9312134582e","7953f13bc46b059db0ef6960e0a02429d2908871","31c163c37fa3a8ef8b37939aa63d9df7fcd56299","003f93a67156585302b97f9c47e7a4ecec6e6c97"],"title":"Likelihood-based population independent component analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs055"}

An important modelling aspect in this setting is the choice between constant or covariate-dependent weights. By examining the problem of curve fitting from a predictive perspective, we show the advantages of using covariate-dependent weights. These advantages are a result of the incorporation of covariate proximity in the latent partition. However, closer examination of the partition yields further complications, which arise from the vast number of total partitions. To overcome this, we propose to modify the probability law of the random partition to strictly enforce the notion of covariate proximity, while still maintaining certain properties of the DP. This allows the distribution of the partition to depend on the covariate in a simple manner and greatly reduces the total number of possible partitions, resulting in improved curve fitting and faster computations. Numerical illustrations are presented.","inCitations":["76de9f8fca83937a5a7e01231043c9b5b1d2e452","03f8849602439abee2bd8da1bf3a2debabe73991","54effff7a83ca6f949e476ed35f73457b7d2c759","45742de9da9653e40009c0b6e791fa2904280caa","dbceaa3027c3b3b03ecb1e0a7f8a5aca91c23f15","4076b9c1f6fa416b7b09af12e09e67145af8e8fd","0952011dd79a1be03f49497e5d305a760c609b68","1af15b10dee8977fe85ccfc6e9d5b935cf4f8d03","b9036d6f0bc62fef8523124ad0e95e77d1107bec","9abcedf8c077e3f800c1fb7b2a5369b3440c290e","3482d984fd1c60416e40ba4409a42addbc74da7f","0b2b06e3b00515655f2846e1c0a3b035a41da064","db56dcd63a7fe527ebe02d46469a6d3a771373cf"],"title":"A Predictive Study of Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Curve Fitting.","doi":"10.1111/sjos.12047"}

The distribution of the data within each group may be a mixture of both a continuous and a discrete component, and no assumptions are made regarding the way in which the distributions of the two groups of data may differ from each other - in particular, the assumption of a shift model is avoided. The proposed equivalence testing procedure for this scenario refers to the median of the independent difference distribution, i.e. to the median of the differences between independent observations from the test group and the reference group, respectively. The procedure provides an asymptotic equivalence test, which is symmetric with respect to the roles of 'test' and 'reference'. It can be described either as a two-one-sided-tests (TOST) approach, or equivalently as a confidence interval inclusion rule. A one-sided variant of the approach can be applied analogously to non-inferiority testing problems. The procedure may be generalised to equivalence testing with respect to quantiles other than the median, and is closely related to tolerance interval type inference.","inCitations":["33d154e8b39b87aacb2bb3fa0ab81736262793e5","baf49fd66bad6a4a8f168b0bf76123a088237775","87b6320a62af4c19459509bd858246c980603c7c","0e4e99a6950a06bb329de26ad7bbc7782ab56c1b","4d41201b9f882164939601ca175d38a874725195","fb4ea555d4cccfcb13ceccd931321f8ddd8feeee","a9f0850ac57085958099e8ee681505e59290838b"],"title":"Nonparametric equivalence testing with respect to the median difference.","doi":"10.1002/pst.384"}

Methods for handling the problem presented by missing data of patients who withdraw before reaching the time point of the primary measurement include carrying the last observation forward (LOCF), data as observed analysis (DAO), mixed model approaches, and pattern mixture models.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe evaluate a multiple imputation (MI) approach that has the flexibility to adjust inferences about the treatment effect for the withdrawn patients relative to currently used alternatives. Sensitivity analyses are performed under a collection of scenarios that include many circumstances that may arise in practice, including different assumptions about treatment effects post-withdrawal and about the missing data mechanism. Simulations are used to compare the results of analyses based on the MI approach with those based on the LOCF, DAO, and the mixed model approaches.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe LOCF and DAO approaches cannot be recommended as strategies for handling missing responses, at least for these scenarios, because they provide biased estimates of treatment effects and biased tests of the null hypothesis of no treatment effect. Application of the various approaches to the analysis of clinical data from a longitudinal trial confirms the underestimation of the variability when the LOCF approach is used.","inCitations":["620bc6d3e15b2e5b252ef3b1f53c9148b6989148","ad36f7479825694dad1724c05e6c56df025f1be7","e8d756eb3f87e5c9f865e45c56d63d575ec3bb6d","424ec3567c6ef3364debe9f7076d3d3c814aee9b","bce3af7916233b519a67a44bea5366f2f1bc3eea","72028a58300d8bfaed625adc5a25548adace7c7e","bc79d3a66b29638e15576d9b1642ff316b96153d","432efac0d6145b282f6be61d7c7fc208708e42c3","25b3faeb7bf00cddee7ac8543dbd6e5215ef7537","9de33f521b5fd761b495b726046f46df388d18f7","354818cebfb297113f40a3bf172e22da72d23f18","1f8180df44e3008f94806e41f1a6764465cc378e","21f297300cbfa0b63c01010183658b535a7c648f","6fb88b86446e038dfb8d37a1b464a19c30260060","fc831138acc5728db8c85861e6a777b75bf04b78","22b30d4d268b1dd49e40c7bf323c488edb91f5f1","e8b02e631308428fa97500e09b6fb2ead9e8ee11","3413e41f5dcf920775b442e228dc958e21773b37","69904a3623258097c3d9461adca27764912e12e4","fc1cbccc79997fb356f7eccae447b2b87c172138","25bce2c645df8ce98fd09fefc33bd83370725638","6916702d9732c030698791dd2359e7fc7ccfc3c8","ed0078b12250b04e935b67e04faaae626bae4e43","3a956c1988f54fd0b018c678d1134579f485d780","e140b7fb6615209210247c1d380460a8847b1a37","4adcf54f827861e487dde13a1dfde6c41604d933","5e9ce68926f033fe52163f1bfd0ff72069ff0820","7244773fd203b88d3501774d5ae3ffafc3cdbe1f","e6d07ac6c93d417b5a8827c5ecc438bf3937a15a","35d12029455f1f0f006546bdc882f706e5d8db5e","2acfb111f0796767b65b0deed1fbab4f3e6983ba","b7b30fc7dfc2ff9f59159033770059a1e5cbe2b3","f8a581024d01979558dc912b12089b71e66ef360","eceaf83b665ac5ca2db8933414afc7d743eebf29","f506faf983c31cbdf8aea2b8e942e12bd5920521","5ee38e2cee6a7b9b31e42bf6c6dc3a6c6e81a158","f23875f9f175b7dd0845c678fcf6b61715de5016","749f03a67cf523f8b13eb91d0d3c7962f6019da8","b03045ba5708147a49d31e20b2ee6062ff873a30","3117b5cd2aae3dd59eada57a4b7c936a26fc6831","da42246a7a2edbf914351cd10c7e4e44b8d8920b","233bb57838ef991286eb86a4841271c383ee5951","167438480dc24b32041db15a78a2e4419b2b1421","9e8cb49a63ab26534fad058c3316f58c974f0458","fcae4e9addfb149327315cae444561f7da862197","4c1062abb5d288b106255819c5f75309714e4d43","ff695f7712167fb74bcd95d56957bbc04fd619ed","73719dffd43fab1058b23785a0ad2f55f6a254c4","4bb9542c2f3028c2906a7c93be8a7e32f0220fb2","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","a0f2dbdf5a6ec3d644bff2454bd7c3f95f09a237","d062a9139c8a432751ad79bd185eb3649f2667b4","df96b4c39ef6d0dce23953836bb07e8190e5c623","d8a0a3ad4df33fc761486e2c6a54eea355f6b374","7a216ee7b97076e66706e7231c648031ade5e640","b9c06b1faef9746e1f378fde34d7b22d88e736e6"],"title":"Comparison of alternative strategies for analysis of longitudinal trials with dropouts.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120015744"}

Tests for such designs that use the data from both stages have been based on simulation under the global null hypothesis. We present an approach that does not rely on simulation and protects the familywise error rate in the strong sense. The main idea is to view the trial as a data-dependent modification of a simpler design, for which we know the distributions of its test statistics. To account for the data-dependent modification, we use the conditional invariance principle (Brannath et al., 2007).","inCitations":["1142f78863df2e2da6517c3a28d5102b9d77455a"],"title":"Familywise error control in multi-armed response-adaptive two-stage designs.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.551337"}

In this paper, we address the issue of analysis of clinical data generated by the bridging study conducted in the new region to evaluate the similarity for extrapolation of the foreign clinical data to the population of the new region. Information on efficacy, safety, dosage, and dose regimen of the original region cannot be concurrently obtained from the local bridging studies but are available in the trials conducted in the original region. A Bayesian noninferiority approach is therefore proposed to incorporate the data generated in the original region to evaluate bridging evidence by the local bridging studies and assess similarity between the new and original regions. Methods for sample size determination for the bridging study are also proposed.","inCitations":["e241c9719f9e052d29eef8b3e90ae11b62f6a5c5","58b86670c39e3fbafc19d8a1b77b590c2f3d13e1","605e44fcc1b071ffead20bbf77c454ebbe4393fc","ee70e8071e9eff492cd3ba08e5e05570cd5541b9","15db4dd620177ba77358b3855f79248afbbe1123","270f30e853cd43fabc0ffab560f4dc6a9f7345e2","9a5230dc51bcc4c0e3b5489312e1b87d86f18271","b537abfa7084c5085727f33c669bd633005f7a2e"],"title":"A Bayesian noninferiority approach to evaluation of bridging studies.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120037180"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"This work is concerned with understanding common population-level effects of stroke on motor control while accounting for possible subject-level idiosyncratic effects. Upper extremity motor control for each subject is assessed through repeated planar reaching motions from a central point to eight pre-specified targets arranged on a circle. We observe the kinematic data for hand position as a bivariate function of time for each reach. Our goal is to estimate the bivariate function-on-scalar regression with subject-level random functional effects while accounting for potential correlation in residual curves; covariates of interest are severity of motor impairment and target number. We express fixed effects and random effects using penalized splines, and allow for residual correlation using a Wishart prior distribution. Parameters are jointly estimated in a Bayesian framework, and we implement a computationally efficient approximation algorithm using variational Bayes. Simulations indicate that the proposed method yields accurate estimation and inference, and application results suggest that the effect of stroke on motor control has a systematic component observed across subjects.","inCitations":["b0fdc5892e5c8435bccee0064fd9d1afa6254839","ba963e491cada9a8dc663970e552f888be303e34","62d9180364ebd4cf9667a914444833df1651eaf8","5c8fb81b1ad7ca0d54b58006c89b82ed7584fbeb","db7af1f1a8dd19a1d22d80b5663d56c986a8bda2","f7acf274c393d58dd76b789dbf2c3d0830368a3a","b3a2670dc08d3d26fb3616a78526d03d62293957","f0bf381873906b589a23093d0060548885ed2707","f8daf28b71bec977f3d315cc303cae601444fd5b","76543164678ee4745e43b4cc215b43fb62d0ec89","091e59e7b4c923738432910352fbb942f9dd88c1","62199598054bcc322d2bdf9966fa0e485e51e7ff","6bc01ab828c27b42f6e2bed7c54f514cdf16ed3f","7fc107bf3eff5fa7a78226ef946a7b14034bef26","b66a77fb608f7685879d485bba3022e047272f3e","0621312d89fa1b9f008df5b4828d69e0dc1651c5","80d245defedf740381a14385a24ed8ce08941ed7","67d48e5ce662c74b10b20420dc25258995d9c584","8bf641ee6c06d620e93515f178f0d80487d27384","05e58a4634b7d4d847fcecc868a3c255365fe9f9","07f1bcf66e6484915b7ef582b8bdf9d4a67c536e","32f540ed4a15f3109b046a43cd8a17d7853de4ae","a02e031af9e0d0d7864dd747a5c5bfbfd037125f"],"title":"Assessing systematic effects of stroke on motorcontrol by using hierarchical function-on-scalar regression.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12115"}

The USP/NF provides requirements for sampling plans, testing procedures, and acceptance criteria for these tests. To ensure that there is a high probability of passing the USP/NF tests, the sponsors usually establish in-house specification limits based on some lower bounds of the probabilities of passing USP/NF tests for future samples. In this article, we derive some probability lower bounds for USP/NF tests. It is shown that the proposed probability lower bounds are better than the existing ones and are very close to the true probabilities in a broad range of the population mean and variance of the test sample.","inCitations":["2b5398e2794699980709b15211917689517b612e","b38faf1d6f43501ad8553151c010419c2ae422fc","35504fbbb48386fea280855dc9f4aa349d71ced8"],"title":"Probability lower bounds for USP/NF tests.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120005781"}

We propose a model for the joint effect of SNPs, methylation, and gene expression on disease risk and obtain the marginal model for SNPs by integrating out methylation and expression. We characterize all possible causal relations among SNPs, methylation, and expression and study the corresponding null hypotheses of no SNP effect in terms of the regression coefficients in the joint model. We develop a score test for variance components of regression coefficients to evaluate the genetic effect. We further propose an omnibus test to accommodate different models. We illustrate the utility of the proposed method in an asthma GWAS study, a brain tumor study, and numerical simulations.","inCitations":["f2e64676b46884b9cd7030deb5645f60237d6e7b","b14e09613d00a0133197f9df787387458cc67f48","03efb5a858e2721e6e37b7fc863870c074124fcb","b8604c1c00ec3457f66a188faa1232fed33f1e22","c0c75dd4acc0ecb1daaa9d2a5800bf9e14fdfe81","d7f0a1e43d769e12224962b7cebfd44128cf1536","b3283b39d0f930211570ee6964cc35d50c68dc36","81062e7d8994b0cef6762de23ae38fbd0c4c2b4d","325800548a5eecb0c0d9b0310490532b8bc9d2ab"],"title":"Integrative modeling of multiple genomic data from different types of genetic association studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu014"}

Classical genetic association studies regress a single clinical outcome on many genetic variants one by one, but there is an increasing demand for joint analysis of many molecular outcomes and genetic variants in order to unravel functional interactions. Unfortunately, most existing approaches to joint modeling are either too simplistic to be powerful or are impracticable for computational reasons. Inspired by Richardson and others (2010, Bayesian Statistics 9), we consider a sparse multivariate regression model that allows simultaneous selection of predictors and associated responses. As Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference on such models can be prohibitively slow when the number of genetic variants exceeds a few thousand, we propose a variational inference approach which produces posterior information very close to that of MCMC inference, at a much reduced computational cost. Extensive numerical experiments show that our approach outperforms popular variable selection methods and tailored Bayesian procedures, dealing within hours with problems involving hundreds of thousands of genetic variants and tens to hundreds of clinical or molecular outcomes.","inCitations":["c6d04b892927a10a777aba0c4e1b3b991c1e70e7","930352bf26d73091b1e8e1c564376cc6fa57d9e7","6f0babac6ec9c2c0f12e5dd8997efbc739bff3bf","1c86d76cc38478505d2df062aedb2e3baafe98a4","a5a86502c5a82aedd065064e5d7caee91d911bc8","de955686a3ea90c580114038e30888c65223aebf"],"title":"Efficient inference for genetic association studies with multiple outcomes","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx007"}

Generally, large amounts of clinical data are available prior to the start of a study, particularly on the current study's control arm. There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., 'borrowing') this information. With historical data providing information on the control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently similar to the current control data. If this assumption of similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either reduced power or increased type I error depending on the direction of the bias. In this manuscript, we review several methods for historical borrowing, illustrating how key parameters in each method affect borrowing behavior, and then, we compare these methods on the basis of mean square error, power and type I error. We emphasize two main themes. First, we discuss the idea of 'dynamic' (versus 'static') borrowing. Second, we emphasize the decision process involved in determining whether or not to include historical borrowing in terms of the perceived likelihood that the current control arm is sufficiently similar to the historical data. Our goal is to provide a clear review of the key issues involved in historical borrowing and provide a comparison of several methods useful for practitioners.","inCitations":["c3bef932662dee1618157fd09ce93e65b65e6228","512ef99cce2ff6f449736cce06f468cf762d9446","c94efd2f9713144651fda777f0c2c44bb08fe7d1","0427e65758cfc5224ec712b2536965582c4cd084","f35a6da9c749d118dcd758066b4ff0f8bfd616e8","0a4ea95699af1ce3830e53bbb6ba19971e4d8600","9fd9dd4d9b51982b84ee87a748b021d1230d3595","29e2175e543ab6ccfa8c99ae6b7f08247d147030","870ac68e808f82d5698ef39797d81cee19b5ca84","b4d020fe0f55fd9820698f0fd4f6cbefd17aa79b","4c27d398b96c2e2d4170e86784fd7e36d8124716","a93aa41808344991d256fffba428232cc8ebb83a","8246d894af9bd250373b914e3c4eda66d292de49","b280c8565f758a9695bdc24c9948cd37281c7453","f6c7604c2bc7945cf0b3ded46ee10f46bacdc220","9fea7a4c137657df6f7411f5b74b55c044a03660","ced059b36898d7a0ade70cd5e1d24d11a95dc423","0605c03b6f1d90374362b46c17efc1aae2277899","38b59256b6ee84974f460a0f86330417bb512ae1","343f11eadae83219b8945edd9cc970911827b37c","54a7cbae2d05f92364520c95a9fbce2e342b026a","12124eb7c8a1f08ba8d881de4e80086d50d6c1f7","875dac72efc60ef7ecee303ef60cff8ed7926faa","e7987d8eb694cd2f774d2b068a402de675b4e8c4","a146dad1cf294f3445f4f400bd251e22512a42e5","77879122cb499f6ce9c728b833569f1fc643833f","a050fd915321e419f8f4dae6f62594c76f521200","b3e9153bf6c05f9043802b4cba56e9a564d4f9a1","3b9e050bbf4e6c87ff8b5dd0a7635ee145b01612","4bc0ae718b3958ef810e59a0bfb523b8d0105281","efdd34c1c83740e52d0c4e99d50e691f17a23a9c","ff000b68e1311df7bc5d76e0f615073ae1866ba3","b2a6373b8b9c6080f99b472404cc86ca020e04c7","ae5ac20836f07649c24a35a2a155b2b23b6b4bfb","c24122f8721b90ad50e4e99d37f4e3af0e404451","07f1062d022ac0822cfc3f94098ffd7dc474fa7e","78af11d025523c17d02156532e8cae770a411396","7f3494e30443e14db09c21f5705f0b22367b2881","96a881489b0a0a5111960276dd2f53f67f64252d","c9c48cfbda15232793e585fd7c9a84c13dac0904","13360ddce3c1e041b4318e97f6cea69d5d1ee0d0","20555fc9ce376e4a26fae1852ee6d9d243ab5bbe","1ea8bc9016f97102cc25f53bf9cd6b67be893ec4","2ab5963ec8c926b6d5fa668ba6cd1a2c56202387","3cd3f257fc773d906dd65e9fbe898d3722a46787","0a8ce517355eeceea057574f34835f3e239e9a6a","71bb4547961c1d8b066eab8fafc401d292a751da","a37223a39f463f6973f4ccfd6e0a0bef4cb067ad","0db347e5de09ada8c1396aea404388ce957d9d86","c4c973c6d7f37c29a17497fd52ed6b0a8645d9f5","57b424f45b78419700d7d4755ca7f3a32631f2e6","10b18a114fa561b571601f822926585f24307a4e","c290c842c3374efa4353f631233f1d7d508de1a3","5c974d3699e53234f4d1690e2722690c946d9b07","5d6f84f2cb9c4a3cafbcf682b05219671a8321c5","2e5d0547c61286075560d979985ecf50d3e7bce2","2a127ae826710e91928205ad797fbfebed1c2295","ea22be47acb92f8a174082a6360f45e553c6cc13","04f58c6dda2807f796ada43de524fae47ea5816f","622480602dd96593d8a18cb9b80e8f954686742e","f0d1de4266f9e67c2b297cf43a25cb950cf9d1cd","a898acc2de378fb47650c7793361c919f1765c6b","e3f3a85cb885c07a4fe1c81e94a6bf32818fb213","99493772039bbd584103d54ff848629316baf12b","a867c2f99a3c39365817ae5290a7ed8cc9495aa9","0c84921b639c7b1cb2f9c4a9126a26ec1fe3f698","0f52f59865c6572e24e5905c842b30eeca0db6c4","927d48b50432460aa7304b72d131f4991aa5d785","f2d50a09e063f9de6ca2b1e1c45fb17e5ce3d8a4","881dfd149e66b0d7b5826ca3397caecc816214e3","2be0f4439ffcc4bf1458af5ea3c28a6cdf5a9dac","5e65af2c49020e809616b121908dd0cc4a4041bc","46501ee6e2957f7855e44a1e8251be3acf35fb69","8e3d8299001bf28b9a17b0dac319590c0b08b398","ff17bf0cb9b9279c083eff54e537a1c67838fa56","1013d4b4de6cea1158084f5386a92df19f0d7103","3bc91b4a46c7c73449d3ccb7d6e1c7a7cdabfa62"],"title":"Use of historical control data for assessing treatment effects in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1589"}

In practice, however, the gold standard may be too costly or invasive to be applied to all subjects, in which case a two-phase design is often employed. Phase 1 data consisting of inexpensive and non-invasive screening tests on all study subjects are used to determine the subjects that receive the gold standard in the second phase. Naive estimates of prevalence in two-phase studies can be biased (verification bias). Imputation and re-weighting estimators are often used to avoid this bias. We contrast the forms and attributes of the various prevalence estimators. Distribution theory and simulation studies are used to investigate their bias and efficiency. We conclude that the semiparametric efficient approach is the preferred method for prevalence estimation in two-phase studies. It is more robust and comparable in its efficiency to imputation and other re-weighting estimators. It is also easy to implement. We use this approach to examine the prevalence of depression in adolescents with data from the Great Smoky Mountain Study.","inCitations":["85480758def379dd641bb76c41d11915e517c662","c588d9e50ff287db740bb1957b0c587292dac542","1cded06d56187dfc7d4bd37ebd67b6ad23eb2d65","a7c396ef18ea1556c2be31eb21076fa9fbc87f42","eae7a19fdc8f7b1cf0e377559f5b4a9d4ffd98cc","4becd5244622a0a845a0e5f618ccc7d603e800c4","fef5742f9d97bfbf3a7a4f4331b4c61c07a19f60","61e9dced0c11c37f35d718e4bd2b9a014f01b6e7","4b1367e3a1dd26369da87159ae08d2bf63714762","26fd9e3f21cfbfc05173db7d6e74e9f0a46dd594","d24119aef432e1568548920e9924840a86e76c39","59f2d3b80483e99cc4fe4cbd557b9c2979c3fcfb","10aed03881f43fcb4f6bd0263972b73fc0a2c5d5","aa8289ab71d84f3974f91874eaf3c00305ae52a4","a1d61e95673bce54206d62dacba4fe3ebe7e5d03","f08d30de3479a574bf92768eb13e6a51a28ed20f","42f29251184f6bbaaa24c7a7cfe9cc4b87420c90","4161a2875752286da25c5fbb436df589885d3c53","1fabcc3594cbe02ea695a8ac5d1c760f46c36bd6","927bae61be2af235021ef8830dbd580bae8d4b24","f6ef82d7d1cc9a7b089207c95fdd60d74da6a975","4bdbd68916ba438a8d112dce3a284b282483814b","ad1ba52a72ebdc217c248559b6c9d4adb1f79025","705416587b97c9e95bb81999dbe9890c443e6d19","6bd2355f1e7b42c688bd7c5267775098c5c83a4c","10b76cef62889de4c3fd1e0c10e4067af30990a1","556d8a4ef3ab0a39a58c4844964768302b091ce1","b906226a1038cfc35931475fd167dbd88f11e170","40e4fbcf755cf584a05d43bb423226b373c3ecdf","6c3c184e9bdb7508da1691da60d9592c57fb267f","480a8dafddcf52ad8488ab1ba3592f201809c4a3"],"title":"Estimating disease prevalence in two-phase studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.313"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Clinical attachment level (CAL) is regarded as the most popular measure to assess periodontal disease (PD). These probed tooth-site level measures are usually rounded and recorded as whole numbers (in mm) producing clustered (site measures within a mouth) error-prone ordinal responses representing some ordering of the underlying PD progression. In addition, it is hypothesized that PD progression can be spatially-referenced, i.e., proximal tooth-sites share similar PD status in comparison to sites that are distantly located. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian multivariate probit framework for these ordinal responses where the cut-point parameters linking the observed ordinal CAL levels to the latent underlying disease process can be fixed in advance. The latent spatial association characterizing conditional independence under Gaussian graphs is introduced via a nonparametric Bayesian approach motivated by the probit stick-breaking process, where the components of the stick-breaking weights follows a multivariate Gaussian density with the precision matrix distributed as G-Wishart. This yields a computationally simple, yet robust and flexible framework to capture the latent disease status leading to a natural clustering of tooth-sites and subjects with similar PD status (beyond spatial clustering), and improved parameter estimation through sharing of information. Both simulation studies and application to a motivating PD dataset reveal the advantages of considering this flexible nonparametric ordinal framework over other alternatives.","inCitations":["084d62471a403d946c20db2149d6b481c1fbf127","a8a52b576e2e486c047a3050be4aca58182521a8"],"title":"Nonparametric spatial models for clustered ordered periodontal data.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12150"}

Linear mixed models are used to derive generalized test-retest reliability measures. The method allows for repeated measures with a different mean structure due to correction for covariate effects. Furthermore, different variance-covariance structures between measurements can be implemented. When the variance structure reduces to a random intercept (compound symmetry), classical methods are recovered. With more complex variance structures (e.g. including random slopes of time and/or serial correlation), time-dependent reliability functions are obtained. The effect of time lag between measurements on reliability estimates can be evaluated. The methodology is applied to a psychiatric scale for schizophrenia.","inCitations":["0098687cf51d8d400ed875bb542aa1c29caa742b","0819b403d5491153a3bce3a1f18bcf5af7524a96","07c75ec6794de9fbd8e8def320adff8697f7fd9d","b1d02616bac9623627d5cb4209ea242d1a121c74","f55f5d10839ebdbb55ef21f9a4ab97d704351bfe","35b6e9976ee109442ee8b332fc46c44a6dc8acda","b450ddd647d8f849050ca2a19546255eacdde64f","c50f71a53d3e0d05b4abaaf810d4292126cc0933","9e82ba3ff1e80043a5326f17cfc13accc30b737a","4bba7fc8078c1bd205d246257100a4c7a537e362","2b54daaa54d5db8cdc0e543e5025159302b8361b","5eb2d0a32c9276773788c92242eb34b92b7e928c","3dafaab5e93d8c48ad3e315508f0eb9b034bb561","504ce4178a36020e8a0967f627ddc7f933e8c68c","534675efde7f80235dc521110aec66cb55f4a2c3","88e8364592cd764f68e541167fa3ea5e25b78b96"],"title":"Generalized reliability estimation using repeated measurements.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X66068"}

To address this we present Bayesian diagnostic measures for characterising evidence against a \"null model\" of pairwise independence. In simulation studies, as well as for a real data analysis, we show that our approach provides a useful tool for the exploratory nonparametric Bayesian analysis of large multivariate data sets.","inCitations":["fb710213c2c28ca49738be3d827027baa18e4930","42f49e03b48318c963325927c53ef762b60567cc"],"title":"Scalable Bayesian nonparametric measures for exploring pairwise dependence via Dirichlet Process Mixtures.","doi":"10.1214/16-EJS1171"}
