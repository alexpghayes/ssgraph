DF describes complexity of the whole fitted model but in general it is unclear how to allocate DF to individual effects. We give a new definition of DF for arbitrary normal-error linear hierarchical models, consistent with Hodges & Sargent's, that naturally partitions the n observations into DF for individual effects and for error. The new conception of an effect's DF is the ratio of the effect's modeled variance matrix to the total variance matrix. This gives a way to describe the sizes of different parts of a model (e.g., spatial clustering vs. heterogeneity), to place DF-based priors on smoothing parameters, and to describe how a smoothed effect competes with other effects. It also avoids difficulties with the most common definition of DF for residuals. We conclude by comparing DF to the effective number of parameters p(D) of Spiegelhalter et al (2002).

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2005,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"Agreement coefficients quantify how well a set of instruments agree in measuring some response on a population of interest. Many standard agreement coefficients (e.g. kappa for nominal, weighted kappa for ordinal, and the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for continuous responses) may indicate increasing agreement as the marginal distributions of the two instruments become more different even as the true cost of disagreement stays the same or increases. This problem has been described for the kappa coefficients; here we describe it for the CCC. We propose a solution for all types of responses in the form of random marginal agreement coefficients (RMACs), which use a different adjustment for chance than the standard agreement coefficients. Standard agreement coefficients model chance agreement using expected agreement between two independent random variables each distributed according to the marginal distribution of one of the instruments. RMACs adjust for chance by modeling two independent readings both from the mixture distribution that averages the two marginal distributions. In other words, both independent readings represent first a random choice of instrument, then a random draw from the marginal distribution of the chosen instrument. The advantage of the resulting RMAC is that differences between the two marginal distributions will not induce greater apparent agreement. As with the standard agreement coefficients, the RMACs do not require any assumptions about the bivariate distribution of the random variables associated with the two instruments. We describe the RMAC for nominal, ordinal and continuous data, and show through the delta method how to approximate the variances of some important special cases.","inCitations":["7a2a3f93f8a6529d4eb56ecc4fd5598569e5c893","434d568b75cdc0b0f017ddbac564444cf4847810","313316d84599179d19ebea8e6a83e857fd1c9e84","313dd66aad0d3b6bd433729d84eab03ea031ea50","702c430f50fc4932265368444a29e9b1dcec917b","eb3e9d3a8bcb2797f6b8a05b6e54625f43824dba","bc8a9a729a48dfe914390ccd384ee850d0f5e283","5a2e0a42bcfc51a450874a888bfee764509db1d4","0d356d17110050e42187886bb5c45b2120455abf","ca1364ddaa3887d7491868493c59455ea63e6038","d04917d20cc575f1bfae3de7360bb5cb2f7f52fc","75f7ea657a4e2a7984a559eb61a6397457660fcd","ec3f54928a3b3617a0fc1775849a35ea313d3e61","a93bf96bb41d5b55555148716166b063daffa4de","378e3e71bc3f2c6cc5af891c91d2f8d65086f363","d7fe0980ca2b203ff424364db7cc37d1f42fec9e","7c3e5e25bebb968860f65032467dd9b1cb06071e","f56857bfe067317d9acf2e17e99e03e53c67dfb6"],"title":"Random marginal agreement coefficients: rethinking the adjustment for chance when measuring agreement.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxh027"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2016,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The paradigm shift towards precision medicine reignited interest in determining whether there are differential treatment effects in subgroups of trial participants. Intrinsic to this problem is that any assessment of a differential treatment effect is predicated on being able to estimate the treatment response accurately while satisfying constraints of balancing the risk of overlooking an important subgroup with the potential to make a decision based on a false discovery. While shrinkage models have been widely used to improve accuracy of subgroup parameter estimates by leveraging the relationship between them, there is still a possibility that it can lead to excessively conservative or anti-conservative results. This can possibly be due to the use of the normal distribution as prior, which forces outlying subjects to have their means over-shrunk towards the population mean, and the data from such subjects may be excessively influential in estimation of both the overall mean response and the mean response for each subgroup, or a model misspecification due to unaccounted variation or clustering. To address this issue, we investigate the use of nonparametric Bayes, particularly Dirichlet process priors, to create a flexible shrinkage model. This model represents uncertainty in the prior distribution for the overall response while accommodating heterogeneity among individual subgroups. We simulated data to compare estimates when there is no differential subgroup effect and when there is a differential subgroup effect. In either of these scenarios, the flexible shrinkage model does not force estimates to shrink excessively when similarity of treatment effects is not supported but still retains the attractiveness of improved precision given by the narrower credible intervals. We also applied the same method to a dataset based on trials conducted for an antimicrobial therapy on several related indications.","inCitations":["46501ee6e2957f7855e44a1e8251be3acf35fb69"],"title":"Flexible shrinkage estimation of subgroup effects through Dirichlet process priors.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1226327"}

Studying the characteristics of viral evolution during treatment and after a treatment interruption can lend insight into the mechanisms of viral evolution and fitness. Although interruption of anti-HIV therapy often results in rapid emergence of an archived \"wild-type\" virus population, previous work from our group indicates that when only ENF is interrupted, viral gp41 continues to evolve forward and resistance mutations are lost due to back-mutation and remodeling of the envelope protein. To examine the co-evolution of gp120 and gp41 during ENF interruption we extend the Bayesian Hierarchical Phylogenetic model (HPM). Current HPMs enforce conditional independence across all outcomes while biologically all gene regions within a patient should return the same tree unless recombination confers an evolutionary selective advantage. A two-way-interaction HPM is proposed that provides middle ground between these two extremes and allows us to test for differences in evolutionary pressures across gene regions in multiple patients simultaneously. When the model is applied to a well-characterized cohort of HIV-infected patients interrupting ENF we find that across patients, the virus continued to evolve forward in both gene regions. Overall, the hypothesis of independence over dependence between the gene regions is supported. Models that allow for the examination of co-evolution over time will be increasingly important as more therapeutic classes are developed, each of which may impact other through novel and complex mechanisms.","inCitations":["784eaa947eb6783cb7e0313fc3a6431f5452ef20","5efcb26ddfe60ff010f947d430baae0ce06b8aeb"],"title":"Two-way Bayesian hierarchical phylogenetic models: An application to the co-evolution of gp120 and gp41 during and after enfuvirtide treatment","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.06.007"}

Usually the random effects are assumed to represent different clusters, and clusters are assumed to be independent. In this paper, we consider random effects corresponding to clusters that are spatially arranged, such as clinical sites or geographical regions. That is, we might suspect that random effects corresponding to strata in closer proximity to each other might also be similar in magnitude. Such spatial arrangement of the strata can be modeled in several ways, but we group these ways into two general settings: geostatistical approaches, where we use the exact geographic locations (e.g. latitude and longitude) of the strata, and lattice approaches, where we use only the positions of the strata relative to each other (e.g. which counties neighbor which others). We compare our approaches in the context of a dataset on infant mortality in Minnesota counties between 1992 and 1996. Our main substantive goal here is to explain the pattern of infant mortality using important covariates (sex, race, birth weight, age of mother, etc.) while accounting for possible (spatially correlated) differences in hazard among the counties. We use the GIS ArcView to map resulting fitted hazard rates, to help search for possible lingering spatial correlation. The DIC criterion (Spiegelhalter et al., Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 2002, to appear) is used to choose among various competing models. We investigate the quality of fit of our chosen model, and compare its results when used to investigate neonatal versus post-neonatal mortality. We also compare use of our time-to-event outcome survival model with the simpler dichotomous outcome logistic model. Finally, we summarize our findings and suggest directions for future research.","inCitations":["25698da613aa282148b8484d5c2f32712dd88278","17d25fddd039701466c3b568fd977423e5c9b9d9","1a26542488b22c3ac73c2af46a60b82898cb93e6","7410cda83f2317585d1ca79d26392819c9f345b0","0317e4b8dbcdb6d755f9683a128553ccf32a73c0","dcfa41399892f32ebb368459316c17fd9b12bdc8","c0ab15311612eaceb1cdf9c9bb0fc7831a7fc9ca","9c588e107f6a329ef6bc9bc361da73a5429ab9d8","30895ae1fce8fb35d83a36a51c01b7604dc2e914","5980203b57374660a56e811ae2a51fedccf035a2","0e461bd2f3e903bde9cfb249a50c16753a2b9b95","e247acaf3d055824b18c0c3be08e3adec16034ea","b3d43ceb897bc064582bcbeec8ebca8de2386c3a","c77355c8e298dc52e8e625c5742bb88d8423fec7","d870bf9d86df20eb75b78558259c647669abc7dc","9127a215a6964b2414291f947b16538a3f1287c5","b1674a045f6ec89fe8941f652d44a7786e4b4baf","ce2ffb6ef10d3d9e49e930ea08992eb2146fe2e8","c5c26a04a841db34f9b0db67d72e5d0c6ea223ef","a4b61ba097644bebebfaaf0eafc533ee671a6ea6","512cf3f112aed25db9fa4f68b3927f822f841c23","a0c08e417355f788451e73c539fe4ad4b4aec6c6","63c9c841177fc22734ad96d76afe5a574ffca7d4","923a26bf163bd84ee998fa00dd1f330473f731aa","d9527fe4b481ad1d5979451c46ff3645783ff18d","5f7027db9e03eabd22d86a03a8906fd98ab79681","5c4d6ac586ad42bd70e973e27c621038743d8864","67caf8b1182e6b1849a65542334fabd84a80c94f","246e90f9ad9969f5cd220e8b213998f44d4c637f","37bd3f207189dd4bb5b819fda55b1e91c0afd00a","f3a24715a3db3e1afb2c676f46b6b8c8622a481b","923515cb8f6901db2f96e20711d699312d0773d7","4f79cd4d4d5becfef85ee482c4a81d4108dc6caa","d4a7a5bcadd9caf1c6518ec7b7486420a3562d5e","17cdf616ec225888ea289594a82c3f7035ee4aa5","3bc682ce83a755037c9c7c955bc985d961ceb8ed","6d1b2cd6c937b58e4e8c6624d027960d1f14f8e6","d62156ba33fbf13fd70d8a578c3563c05d9d12fa","729163197ebccaf46471e065ac1879bde5224414","816834f912282206f460577ee138b168bac0f078","b5cbb169e677f82a7794ef0d4236a4e486cc4400","b0af323c69f58c8637f6d79c250b74f9fd7aaa9a","b91e61f49db89df843271b4c4126a15eb9cbdc7e","10a4d888e26f7802b093c4f8315972e2d7ab9256","f1f21a498eaef0a6c515c7f0b8aa6a344291ea08","2964454b8ff81ac1860f774effe06621bba3a522","6e06e33720a4ab2d9cd92f0c56b7e36f24806530","57316cf7945ff87e11f6e463f1b9eb175b2f3c2f","4ea44bb603a231b4a65f40b8aca2360ffaf3fb51","67f89aa984939bfe2aa6bbd43277496b12fab3e8","575330d25403e6835c0d8dcbf0c2db4a3791a327","f31d0fade0dd1ab3b4dc545623f732ccaeb0d2d6","32139625b71c06a4c0bdc9dfebe27c2ab0fc8912","2ee190829620630e6944147a69356f9802d4ffc4","c6e4a0da5acad9f176afa94736267e30b811d3b6","f4f4feef7158b5596070c887efd2f73d642ce460","b37e236133f44ef259c4567bc1ba6b06e9172145","d11d9aea4a291348a0d848c767f3170f3ff9c026","1caec306e6f156684c3d4ff936b20e0c7d438f57","51aa859982cc7be2a42984341ad9ccafff9954bb","e8acf0662ca9547316200992e35f42922787683e","eaf11d4c1c54bbcc75b40d267f609710c314149a","7808c29caa239c374d75f00e443e5136b7749927","2385f3d1c2f2dd8fd408355f58c257485c58e3df","a4fab87fae49071ed40cf03d358302deab139dc2","ce4dd42db38dec3229bde860ac4c14cb85befb39","4a0298fd72d926889f76a52c5f089439b5df6ba0","a43d7c65458390bbcc11a1c13667034738ef8efc","bdc157db7c101679cff85ef5d952d7bcb2532477","8a658f0d7c09abc8c57cfe78ab05ef2cb69ea19c","6ec04b5a016a6e3da8eb74ece9e12dfacec478ca","fed27fd8e8902c686f0356b73b3766aa504cb82d","d8c750e412438af79f8e55abc41332aec15bb053","33160ccaf1d991e8f6778b9ced8d7311329a10b4","3cf0bf04c6fc54288c1b8b85b5f0d30104167be6","1c566daa4eed190302394b876ac7c99efc8909cf","10281fb257f3abbd3cd28848f3f617310dbb2a97","958e2fd69db5a5f04b63a9992b114fb1f419eb09","6a4da161e1444735ec0e64dff105e88e6aaa1c0b","a00a8d14c4e51a9a9e267815a51ac2bf5e2a48fa","64e0c86fe02bb2f0d5daac35372ec0c2b42e5919","2a4de81b63db313d315d7af3d1cd6955f1bfe4d4","788ef02f154b09def53c646a1d534b65e441f789","a45cac564ce408c2bc6232a7cadc7515d2ca1885","41bb6e1087761f67aab1cd95c70d7ff672fdce4a","9b0082db5ded5a1a30f391dd200b2bae6a3cb6a6","512f679d6343e43f15d57ceec4a21cbab009a070","718461bbc556924f6acf5fb3c95634b343ea984c","37ba6fa4c18833e3a84d3708057ac8619ac354d6","2f1c08f5a40f58805649bf2773a993e09464230e","cffce31712a84371a7b82ba79a7ba7afd8ef9c4b","3023807718667e2dfbf226e35dc9b6227fbc7f0f","c5df684ff5d803c058b22b00f86a9b8e4eee41ac","fad60e3df37c832e572dc150fda43067de962f32","a956f9c0ef556506f23cb8f0eba811581eee1335","73fe85c4b852ffdb907c84aa8d2e3157f563b3f2","aed960e4883649d38f79ba0ed263d5dee81d5ca4","1d58c720c5bad110cbed44c4c4d14e6778527af7","1f85ebd3d4762876474326e039ad9453649da70d","1ab9d35ec5617760769b0ba980b7fe616181b578","e38569845bbb57ee71dfed563d8c3cd04f9e3ef1","c68c978fe3a5b4bfce4efd2691dc7bd0c74f7fdf","185eedd372c81311da921e8973b61b730c9d1ea5","e344f94ab4166c17c8791b6602dc1523d0f42668","ec4bc43d4ba9230e5ef8c64c1a90b8e88907a0ac","0ecc553b4280821e7cc89eabf7329e859f9ae235","f880f42ac6dc2bb78d6351bcf8bb9416d239930d","2f0bbcfadcc57b79c1c0c7ce696e3ea129565b6f"],"title":"Frailty modeling for spatially correlated survival data, with application to infant mortality in Minnesota.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.1.123"}

Cross-validation (CV) is a valuable tool for selecting the best model among competing structural models. Influential cases or outliers are often present in practical data. Therefore, even the correct model for the majority of the data may not cross-validate well. This paper discusses various drawbacks of CV based on sample covariance matrices, and develops a procedure for using robust covariance matrices in the model calibration and validation stages. Examples illustrate that the CV index based on sample covariance matrices is very sensitive to influential cases, and even a single outlier can cause the CV index to support a wrong model. The CV index based on robust covariance matrices is much less sensitive to influential cases and thus leads to a more valid conclusion about the practical value of a model structure.","inCitations":["191e7f8943d45c15d23ee410962f865e5169449c","c29768adb5d0f9f38e3f3fdf1ff99855842aaae6","24607b0c82aab2359c66eb78b322c576b5a4ae93","1090f813b76f7bfb361b81d8583c8509847e8ef4"],"title":"Cross-validation by downweighting influential cases in structural equation modelling.","doi":"10.1348/000711002159734"}

In this tutorial we revisit both classes of models, and discuss model comparisons and the interpretation of their parameters.

A limited information test is suggested to test for selection issues in non-experimental data. The specification tests indicate that the (conditional on the set of the confounding variables considered) assumptions of no selection due to unobservables and/or no unobserved individual-specific effects are not violated. Our findings indicate that the first job search service does have positive and significant impacts on the employment rate. However, providing repeated JSS to the same client has no significant impact. Further, we find that there are significant experience-enhancing effects. These findings suggest that providing one job search services training to individuals may have a lasting impact on raising their employment rates.","inCitations":["0087e5852fbbd573f36ae3b55dee181c703fa479","2bb7046a39de195a49d8f0dfd8950e2c34aa4245","f942e2d1781b0444a47e84bec2dda5932c57d51b","1b18d71205c2dc5eac65d5f24751f0a16806af71"],"title":"Evaluating the effectiveness of Washington state repeated job search services on the employment rate of prime-age female welfare recipients.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2008.05.011"}

In addition to nonignorable missingness, there are also problems of skewness and left-censoring in the response variable because of a lower limit of detection (LOD). There has been relatively little work published simultaneously dealing with these features of longitudinal data. In particular, one of the features may sometimes be the existence of a larger proportion of left-censored data falling below LOD than expected under a usually assumed log-normal distribution. When this happens, an alternative model that can account for a high proportion of censored data should be considered. We present an extension of the random effects Tobit model that incorporates a mixture of true undetectable observations and the values from a skew-normal distribution for an outcome with left-censoring, skewness, and nonignorable missingness. A unifying modeling approach is used to assess the impact of left-censoring, skewness, nonignorable missingness and measurement error in covariates on a Bayesian inference. The proposed methods are illustrated using real data from an AIDS clinical study.","inCitations":["ed40cfb0fbd149c8b26064a725e8ed654403a3a9","d0862fbb82b607b3c3dfb033aca4c0c51bd5f6c1","e21571bb8845e24f55abd1d5750d1d6f52d9ce89"],"title":"Bayesian Two-Part Tobit Models with Left-Censoring, Skewness, and Nonignorable Missingness.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.920860"}

A criterion consisting of the complexity of a factor loading matrix and a between-cluster dissimilarity is optimized using the gradient projection algorithm and the k-means algorithm. It is shown that if there is an oblique rotation of an initial loading matrix that has a perfect simple structure, then the proposed method with Kaiser's normalization will produce the perfect simple structure. Although many rotation methods can also recover a perfect simple structure, they perform poorly when a perfect simple structure is not possible. In this case, the new method tends to perform better because it clusters the loadings without requiring the clusters to be perfect. Artificial and real data analyses demonstrate that the proposed method can give a simple structure, which the other methods cannot produce, and provides a more interpretable result than those of widely known rotation techniques.","inCitations":["e066d4c571a195f835ca26322bb8708e0aeab5f4","b8d0f8f32f3acf9d0c13242770ff9edf1ba8ec50"],"title":"A cluster-based factor rotation.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12007"}

We propose that a survey planner use an explicit loss function to quantify the trade-off between cost and informativeness of the survey and aim to make a design choice that minimizes loss. We pose a choice between three options: ask all respondents about an item of interest, use skip sequencing, thereby asking the item only of respondents who give a certain answer to an opening question, or do not ask the item at all. The first option is most informative but also most costly. The use of skip sequencing reduces respondent burden and the cost of interviewing, but may spread data quality problems across survey items, thereby reducing informativeness. The last option has no cost but is completely uninformative about the item of interest. We show how the planner may choose among these three options in the presence of two inferential problems, item nonresponse and response error.","inCitations":["ff218c89fbd0dcb5e82af0bb7f6029b67661e875","22294ad3b699b42734842c0de0f0ec66270f5cc0","2e0c0733f238d9f0922bf9912a2d4a889f0d5ce3","2fb6d09f4d8959bafe1e6c08832f237ddcb01fde","ded6bc244070d7b2c16b441d1c3846645348be4b","34ec256330003ea666a8aac82a49c13eb2c03492","5c0e75df99ed25957a12dfd06df5b6b520007a19","07c30697e9768ce276cc8d4578203dc1d9d138a9"],"title":"Skip Sequencing: a Decision Problem in Questionnaire Design.","doi":"10.1214/07-AOAS134"}

The commonly used kernel smoothing estimate is asymptotically normal and the traditional inference procedure then consistently estimates the asymptotic variance function and relies upon normal approximation. Consistent estimation of the asymptotic variance function involves another level of nonparametric smoothing. In practice, the choice of the extra bandwidth parameter can be difficult, the inference results can be sensitive to bandwidth selection and the normal approximation can be quite unsatisfactory in small samples leading to poor coverage. To alleviate the problem, we propose to extend the recently developed self-normalized approach, which is a bandwidth free inference procedure developed for parametric inference, to construct point-wise confidence interval for nonparametric mean function. To justify asymptotic validity of the self-normalized approach, we establish a functional central limit theorem for recursive nonparametric mean regression function estimates under primitive conditions and show that the limiting process is a Gaussian process with non-stationary and dependent increments. The superior finite sample performance of the new approach is demonstrated through simulation studies.","inCitations":["7f9443c3663b09a951160a660ee1b80525fa9ccd","6eee3d44adb736671d6284f8ecd1ae207f83bfdc","e2245d6f07be378ad3b409a5e6637a971af21b8f","346afef94a0c0d27aec2b6f4dc3ba7a781ad1620"],"title":"Nonparametric functional central limit theorem for time series regression with application to self-normalized confidence interval","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2014.09.017"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2000,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"This paper considers the common problem of testing the equality of means in a repeated measures design. Recent results indicate that practical problems can arise when computing confidence intervals for all pairwise differences of the means in conjunction with the Bonferroni inequality. This suggests, and is confirmed here, that a problem might occur when performing an omnibus test of equal means. The problem is that the probability of rejecting is not minimized when the means are equal and the usual univariate F test is used with the Huynh-Feldt correction (epsilon) for the degrees of freedom. That is, power can actually decrease as the mean of one group is lowered, although eventually it increases. A similar problem is found when using a multivariate method (Hotelling's T2). Moreover, the probability of a Type I error can exceed the nominal level by a large amount. The paper considers methods for correcting this problem, and new results on comparing trimmed means are reported as well. In terms of both Type I errors and power, simulations reported here suggest that a percentile t bootstrap used with 20% trimmed means and an analogue of the epsilon-adjusted F gives the best results. This is consistent with extant theoretical results comparing methods based on means with trimmed means.","inCitations":["c3d9baca485741c6c6d56042bd173ed4c7b3e685","ded520fa7d5ad9098f3dcf0674332a22548a4e69","8abdde9fb1064d2a0b39c889bda7ddc0ef56222f","2f545cb427af06d1080f8aaeb11a7c72b9055aad","1b71a92707a79b23518212cbb5ab629005e4b1f9","3af6ed848d4ce5eec98d93ea901c88c2bf237845","fec611fcf7716535e2bf672a8bdcacd47a5abeae","d0f238d1748602d9ddf196d823773393867273ea","1e8bb437184ec19af563af0a7b24b2231275e7ce","d6244f010a9632010a50eb7f0c90cc96425c2ab9","8d5856ba947e2c550a1f3a91a10a2e7ddf01ae62","65ee71ded1da5d5edc5fa42c7e99a3817844b2d9","a6ae5ea1b72a61b9d6a3143917deef50f67854c6","23f19601e314a012392183f6ae261ba8e22e9b45","5845fff6d7309750035414dc1eb8eb26d0f8c16d","556074092b1a1d8b288978e78e4a27257ee7f626","fce9eca8e684a28711fb94e97f5b39332cb5784d","fd6ed173fd6e1d0a9b30a64ce07e42c5d8f24a2a","c18b09bddd08158ae3eae9f845a30ad4a93b6953","b277feb3eaa1c1d13f7fab70693570e91ea95cca","e5cb6b5d6b46e888f707a1d2e965257ede73622e","6220e826a53d3eecfb3d05eb031b620332990bbc","c6b22da6de6ce78f35c223d8ab01e36b62cfbf99","8e7651ede8a2a7b6e7d0f1f3c598a9612941c672","acdf8a75793f8d387fe564224c28fc7f8c06625e"],"title":"Repeated measures ANOVA: some new results on comparing trimmed means and means.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159187"}

These types of data are discrete, high-dimensional, and complex. We propose to study the impact of protein sequences on binary outcomes using a kernel-based logistic regression model, which models the effect of protein through a random effect whose variance-covariance matrix is mostly determined by a kernel function. We propose a novel, biologically motivated, profile hidden Markov model (HMM)-based mutual information (MI) kernel. Hypothesis testing can be carried out using the maximum of the score statistics and a parametric bootstrap procedure. To improve the power of testing, we propose intuitive modifications to the test statistic. We show through simulation studies that the profile HMM-based MI kernel can be substantially more powerful than competing kernels, and that the modified test statistics bring incremental gains in power. We use these proposed methods to investigate two problems from HIV-1 vaccine research: (1) identifying segments of HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein that confer resistance to neutralizing antibody and (2) identifying segments of Env that are associated with attenuation of protective vaccine effect by antibodies of isotype A in the RV144 vaccine trial.","inCitations":["124ed967ad6ddf63794fc403deb8237ffb7ba62a","f84d3d9540971ff3aaad2487b451b00d81f0a937","7e6d4f612eba55d850b0d544d36fd98e29b3e5f8"],"title":"Kernel-based logistic regression model for protein sequence without vectorialization.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu056"}
