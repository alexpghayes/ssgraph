We use the truncated Dirichlet process (DP) as a non-parametric prior for such dynamic parameters in a novel nonlinear Bayesian dynamic factor analysis model. This is equivalent to specifying the prior distribution to be a mixture distribution composed of an unknown number of discrete point masses (or clusters). The stick-breaking prior and the blocked Gibbs sampler are used to enable efficient simulation of posterior samples. Using a series of empirical and simulation examples, we illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach in approximating distributions of very diverse shapes.","inCitations":["8c360f747922b5db8910877a4e077cfd619ca7dd","81ca002523fdb85fc9dbd1b9cef338b39ee3a6ad","775d354887652ee4283edbe11179735fb9135f3e","e280427826d32c3ba51e938f08823b479d36449e","81d84a5eb06a10bd03681a90d8cfa3ef408f5bac","fcd87562884a7b9406603463c77310cc6cec15d8","30365a8364cb4c95d6d518883af16b27ac2c6fc2","018f29b1fbb9bb171f06dd6e84898aea5111d550","6e879d2bd118868fe054ad7d1613c35b2329b664","3a09d561a0fd522477c66ff137130df84f6b8b65","5aecd0302c44617cbd89329968fbfb5b9808aac5","89670bdfb05ef26d35384954da500ca7c45e8505","d2d89b578f1b34a26fe5f56aa6f2e98ffb0de1ee"],"title":"Bayesian estimation of semiparametric nonlinear dynamic factor analysis models using the Dirichlet process prior.","doi":"10.1348/000711010X497262"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2009,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The odds ratio (OR) has been recommended to measure the relative treatment effect in therapeutic equivalence or meta-analysis. When controlling the confounding effect due to strata formed by centers (or trials) on patients' response in a multicenter study (or a meta-analysis), we commonly employ stratified analysis and obtain a summary estimate of the treatment effect. In practice, it is not uncommon to come across data in which there are patients not complying with their assigned treatment. To avoid obtaining a misleading summary estimate due to overlooking the interaction between the stratum and treatment effects as well as the selection bias from noncompliance, it is important to develop test statistics accounting for noncompliance for testing the homogeneity of the OR across strata. In this article, we develop five asymptotic test statistics and employ Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of these statistics in a variety of situations. We note that the weighted-least-squares (WLS) test statistic can be liberal when the number of strata is moderate or large (>/=5). We find that the logarithmic transformation of the WLS (LWLS) test statistic, the squared-root transformation of the LWLS (SLWLS) test statistic, and Fisher's logarithmic transformation of LWLS (LLWLS) test statistic can perform well with respect to Type I error in all the situations considered here. We further find that the Z-transformation of LWLS (ZLWLS) test statistic can be liberal when the number of strata is small or moderate. We note that the LWLS test statistic is likely preferable to the others for a small number of strata, while the ZLWLS test statistic can be the best for a moderate or large number of strata. Finally, we use the data taken from a multiple-risk-factor intervention trial to illustrate the use of these test statistics.","inCitations":["fa7b5372cb82a8507d26f42208c1fbbdcb60fe87","09171099a12c8d2ed4e0e58274cc40ab194fe724"],"title":"Test homogeneity of odds ratio in a randomized clinical trial with noncompliance.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903105497"}

It becomes challenging in presence of a large number of noise variables, which may mask underlying clustering structures. Therefore, noise removal through variable selection is necessary. One effective way is regularization for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection in model-based clustering. However, existing methods focus on regularizing the mean parameters representing centers of clusters, ignoring dependencies among variables within clusters, leading to incorrect orientations or shapes of the resulting clusters. In this article, we propose a regularized Gaussian mixture model permitting a treatment of general covariance matrices, taking various dependencies into account. At the same time, this approach shrinks the means and covariance matrices, achieving better clustering and variable selection. To overcome one technical challenge in estimating possibly large covariance matrices, we derive an E-M algorithm utilizing the graphical lasso (Friedman et al 2007) for parameter estimation. Numerical examples, including applications to microarray gene expression data, demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.","inCitations":["fc1227c34281f8ae882cf362c1f008d4d8580eb6","35b5709d2e3606018fe358c00392701561f8b24a","5d827e4c02884e737bbc2f6720df57dbeb4f92cd","1d7149df3046beb363e28fa636826da8847fab22","fb023cb8c831c3fd3d9dec7dc2e23f9429df5447","81eae0eae76f074b1d6e03b9db0ecddcc1eb766f","fc0d2ba1b4b5cfc4e8c805ef298a41bf5f7fb6ff","d5dc300e9466145a54490bb708138b28d3d0ba9e","fbec348885435a57bebc7f46cecae6722a16f85e","13948dc8e8b04adf37cf47f58a44d57221260497","8ad75911d2a15f453f93c00f0c0d37b02daf6818","2cc4a6929a4435a2f291b9fcb1f1bcdc553691d3","78e3600a3b8ea96330867d5993fbe4ef77aa64fc","c56672fa544e9f0212a1e52fe81fbce549266601","769e9c3e5316f76dc0ceeda39c0786fb05c751a2","e22950827cd74393f5abaf9a30036b4589817a80","343ab523f4117dc38f690fb4afb2231e2b684b9d","abc1743b7e3755b27a37c88828ecf35c5e82f5fa","007088f5ccfef2b757e6b12774a2b1edafa01804","ddc467fc8f3fd1a7a4373f9c94d30d3a25d88647","89d6cf4567bdaa2e18c418387f23460f8f4b003f","1f961a8907d17f5681602d6e95ea7b51c0da7bee","3055883681f70b150ce71884d0bd807af68cbd18","391df01cf94ec914c2bf055f802ef9a9526f3be3","1ff73da2c28dc2b028a4f0d53db66d2d35ba8a3b","e14860db864b789f8f4a678c8a7a73b1d13285a0","fcf40b06a1a31b2f370fb2c9f521a0b0cbc30948","6ddb12fe54093d8f8d91a3dfcaf3d8eac6639576","30cd29c2ead772dafd1cd3ea5c791973c4161d36","282754ace601fe4113890c1235ab62c296a1077d","91b8076b87c153d01b660287609b7e9606187215","af9306d936b18d139adb7223928c93c1df58dee0","3766d6fe45328e3d94ea0b3823001a1e9d317214","c950f8dee2d4425c4c4cfceb70fbee1a1247c99d","4aa6575f6085308e0f30032cffc9ffe36dc23bfa","0cd38100fcf6ae8877d9dd2e97b816e23fe4238d","adef1691b3c10eaa445507f4543e96a1ce5bcdab"],"title":"Penalized model-based clustering with unconstrained covariance matrices.","doi":"10.1214/09-EJS487"}

This quantity is typically estimated based on p-values or test statistics. In some scenarios, there is additional information available that may be used to more accurately estimate the FDR. We develop a new framework for formulating and estimating FDRs and q-values when an additional piece of information, which we call an \"informative variable\", is available. For a given test, the informative variable provides information about the prior probability a null hypothesis is true or the power of that particular test. The FDR is then treated as a function of this informative variable. We consider two applications in genomics. Our first application is a genetics of gene expression (eQTL) experiment in yeast where every genetic marker and gene expression trait pair are tested for associations. The informative variable in this case is the distance between each genetic marker and gene. Our second application is to detect differentially expressed genes in an RNA-seq study carried out in mice. The informative variable in this study is the per-gene read depth. The framework we develop is quite general, and it should be useful in a broad range of scientific applications.","inCitations":["e0e91b00908f3e8b0ccf054127f8c29f1ec1851a"],"title":"The functional false discovery rate with applications to genomics.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz010"}

This article focuses on HPV-16/18, and uses a so-called fractional-polynomial model to this effect, derived in a data-driven fashion. Initially, model selection was done from among the second- and first-order fractional polynomials on the one hand and from the linear mixed model on the other. According to a functional selection procedure, the first-order fractional polynomial was selected. Apart from the fractional polynomial model, we also fitted a power-law model, which is a special case of the fractional polynomial model. Both models were compared using Akaike's information criterion. Over the observation period, the fractional polynomials fitted the data better than the power-law model; this, of course, does not imply that it fits best over the long run, and hence, caution ought to be used when prediction is of interest. Therefore, we point out that the persistence of the anti-HPV responses induced by these vaccines can only be ascertained empirically by long-term follow-up analysis.","inCitations":["97bff718f37272d3c82254a2fa4ab9ab6b394e57","ffc353f37c969f846a79f15f2e2029c2008310b9","897d95e3e499e6960aeb735805cb313b677c3fa6","3c9b2a304864af4f4cf1a7c07a62f3963bd6baa0","4eabde8b5ed946425dda8236d191458071817274","4ccfcda95876a4e07f395d8ed3ace02111df0900","6c5904350d5b232f33b5db13da6cf0109db6b000","2881a4e46f359ba29ef97ef718ff9cd71e000e7e","77613f58ff1fc393ba4c7a603f3643eae84d02b3","b7c500634fb2d995ecc6a6765c7f532766853e2a","cb6bee3fa109962bf8006878226b2cf69a46e1bd"],"title":"Model-based estimates of long-term persistence of induced HPV antibodies: a flexible subject-specific approach.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.834917"}

Utility is the numeric valuation applied to a health state based on the preference of being in that state relative to perfect health. Utilities are often combined with survival data in health economic modelling to obtain quality-adjusted life years. There are several methods available for deriving the preference weights and the health states to which they are applied, and combining them to estimate utilities, and the clinical statistician has valuable skills that can be applied in ensuring the robustness of the trial design, data collection and analyses to obtain and handle this data. In addition to raising awareness of the subject and providing source references, the paper outlines the concepts and approaches around utilities using examples, discusses some of the key issues, and proposes areas where statisticians can collaborate with health economic colleagues to improve the quality of this important element of health technology assessment.","inCitations":["737bf97d5efb079c97a2b6a8e7f96d020f544fa3","983e97a357b7ad3117c19624dfd260a223e10f36","e232f22f47504241e8747b793e5885ce5024c95a","35345f6a7e299462a36483fcccc60ed1194e8fcb","7c5ba2076db7da18fe2aaa35cc703c10f1e1471f"],"title":"Utility values in health technology assessments: a statistician's perspective.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1616"}

Often, the primary goal is to characterize the change in response over time and the factors that influence change. Factors can affect not only the location but also more generally the shape of the distribution of the response over time. To make inference about the shape of a population distribution, the widely popular mixed-effects regression, for example, would be inadequate, if the distribution is not approximately Gaussian. We propose a novel linear model for quantile regression (QR) that includes random effects in order to account for the dependence between serial observations on the same subject. The notion of QR is synonymous with robust analysis of the conditional distribution of the response variable. We present a likelihood-based approach to the estimation of the regression quantiles that uses the asymmetric Laplace density. In a simulation study, the proposed method had an advantage in terms of mean squared error of the QR estimator, when compared with the approach that considers penalized fixed effects. Following our strategy, a nearly optimal degree of shrinkage of the individual effects is automatically selected by the data and their likelihood. Also, our model appears to be a robust alternative to the mean regression with random effects when the location parameter of the conditional distribution of the response is of interest. We apply our model to a real data set which consists of self-reported amount of labor pain measurements taken on women repeatedly over time, whose distribution is characterized by skewness, and the significance of the parameters is evaluated by the likelihood ratio

A significant complicating aspect in these analyses can be attributed to the presence of features that exhibit statistical interactions. Indeed, in several clinical investigations such as genetic studies of complex diseases, it is of interest to specifically identify such features. In this paper, we compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in settings involving high dimensional datasets including statistically interacting feature subsets. We evaluate the performance of these classifiers under conditions of varying sample size, levels of signal-to-noise ratio and strength of statistical interactions among features. We summarize two datasets from studies in diabetes and cardiovascular disease involving gene expression, metabolomics and proteomics measurements and compare results obtained using the four classifiers.Results: Simulation studies revealed that the classifier Prediction Analysis of Microarrays had the highest classification accuracy in the absence of noise, statistical interactions and when feature distributions were multivariate Gaussian within each class. In the presence of statistical interactions, modest effect sizes and the absence of noise, Support Vector Machines achieved the best performance followed closely by Random Forests. Random Forests was optimal in settings that included both significant levels of high dimensional noise features and statistical interactions between biomarker pairs. The data applications revealed similar trends in the relative performances of each classifier.Conclusion: Random Forests had the highest classification accuracy among the four classifiers and was successful in incorporating interaction effects between features in the presence of noise in high dimensional datasets.","inCitations":["3bb49c1ced091a9817cc313e5b058872b62fa904","68b9c6ecaa4859d8e4c31b967568fd741e91df20"],"title":"Comparative Evaluation of Classifiers in the Presence of Statistical Interactions between Features in High Dimensional Data Settings","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1373"}

Being based on general mathematical principles, the method can be applied to various models in population genetics. In this paper we extend the technique to the neutral coalescent model with recombination, thus obtaining novel sampling distributions for the two-locus model. We consider the case with subdivided population structure, as well as the classic case with only a single population. In the latter case we also consider the importance sampling proposal distributions suggested by Fearnhead and Donnelly (2001), and show that their two-locus distributions generally differ from ours. In the case of the infinitely-many-alleles model, our approximate sampling distributions are shown to be generally closer to the true distributions than are Fearnhead and Donnelly's.","inCitations":["b600afeac7c174dafd9cd0d326d9ca9aa539c725","e58e2cebebca0549c9c5776ec9070d0eda248302","740ca78abae6e8b3305a92fbbad536147d5683ff","cf257ee62475b639dba4628c7194808bd9508cf6","93f62433155a24d625a085c2fe716a59e7496e8c","ea3705988ed870949bd819fabead88938c4d5fb1","c785fff05ca2d98ce675cbc09a2f0cdb7a67363a","72ec8870f3cdf206afd8f524a5e3279aac9ed4e7","2324b68404350dfd5dba10b95b102db5f5b63daf","cb2a57ed6fb9b1f2c373e6daaa297ec38969713c","7e95af2348c8ac4159ca2a827382ee1778aa414d","2a747f47f527b753cd70ecc831205f3113b3f8ef","afc1c9a96886b2d294a53af2186b6a62262dfbb2","59d045270f202476a72ab6b7602efe68d08a5459","52e2ad9b71d8aad74455896ac90d1757c4c021e2","8efa68aedbdfaa17df81983d150a668001a0e3f7","b6cf29558ad1a7af45a3ec7160ad169988b406b8","e402a630b659ff150de3c1807f4583b9189c8205","81d262435d22e5a8b3246b7e666fedcefa8b7aec","97889c40a40786ae9b44340e2f24605c9dcb21cd","1baaab76d6a7d4c63ce079a2c184bbb8bc4ef50b","ab30b47cf0ca8e542b206393f9309e3fa90c6e4d","ea3543d9174c5957f519ef85154930e07f10f972","397ae2ee912f398841d2c8f5e513f769c0e43267","bc7f7f6eb2dc18490733d7253d9ef4412805aa87","542c8b159e714109d97eb2b6b0dc09309893edf8","4e421201c44ec90185242b0181fd3c8fc846706a","6f1ac9f38383482455cbea184b883402d626f234","f59e93c18d1627e3dab7ce206d34b550eb41c23b"],"title":"Importance Sampling and the Two-locus Model with Subdivided Population Structure.","doi":"10.1239/aap/1214950213"}
