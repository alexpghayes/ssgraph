Because of limited resources in this stage, prioritizing or ranking genes is a relevant statistical task in microarray studies. In this article, we develop 3 empirical Bayes methods for gene ranking on the basis of differential expression, using hierarchical mixture models. These methods are based on (i) minimizing mean squared errors of estimation for parameters, (ii) minimizing mean squared errors of estimation for ranks of parameters, and (iii) maximizing sensitivity in selecting prespecified numbers of differential genes, with the largest effect. Our methods incorporate the mixture structures of differential and nondifferential components in empirical Bayes models to allow information borrowing across differential genes, with separation from nuisance, nondifferential genes. The accuracy of our ranking methods is compared with that of conventional methods through simulation studies. An application to a clinical study for breast cancer is provided.","inCitations":["55993333a531bfc6b742499a344b7cc034da5030","4715183b80e91f1d1e7c5711df2ad1095133de0a","1a5e45b3907c750965e8f83e80e30376844ccc4f","2f980f2fbff23486333cc25be9fa20f19368d7f1","1718e3639de4e6ea55d79fd7f629b20735f2371b","d210c110b46cd3b18087d239cbd23db5425a4332","ada480891541afe9d52d9f40e3efc23809789823","9493c6e4be1d29eaff0b53569cbe9780f41e96b8","aeeeca35b064dc6c2fe677148af83a81f0a74861","1bd968c5961e7bde39a0372f70566267a9aa1ea9","56ece4ea7086c88c2173ee5cd8b1276c1f626fc8","7e7d0f7a9493e55c245250a3f330ff382bf003cb"],"title":"Bayesian ranking and selection methods using hierarchical mixture models in microarray studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp047"}

Locally efficient estimators of marginal treatment effects, which achieve minimum variance under an assumed model, are available for settings in which outcomes are independent. The value of the pursuit of locally efficient estimators in other settings, such as when outcomes are multivariate, is often debated. We derive and evaluate semiparametric locally efficient estimators of marginal mean treatment effects when outcomes are correlated; such outcomes occur in randomized studies with clustered or repeated-measures responses. The resulting estimating equations modify existing generalized estimating equations (GEE) by identifying the efficient score under a mean model for marginal effects when data contain baseline covariates. Locally efficient estimators are implemented for longitudinal data with continuous outcomes and clustered data with binary outcomes. Methods are illustrated through application to AIDS Clinical Trial Group Study 398, a longitudinal randomized clinical trial that compared the effects of various protease inhibitors in HIV-positive subjects who had experienced antiretroviral therapy failure. In addition, extensive simulation studies characterize settings in which locally efficient estimators result in efficiency gains over suboptimal estimators and assess their feasibility in practice.","inCitations":["4ab69b616cfb86f17dc268570a844286739185c1","39dbd37d8c9cbefdf4989d05e18d5847319ae05e"],"title":"Locally Efficient Estimation of Marginal Treatment Effects When Outcomes Are Correlated: Is the Prize Worth the Chase?","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2013-0031"}

Specifically, there are papers showing an association between the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and Type 2 diabetes. Many meta-analyses use individual studies that do not attempt to adjust for multiple testing or multiple modeling. Hence the claims reported in a meta-analysis paper may be unreliable as the base papers do not ensure unbiased statistics. Objective Determine (i) the statistical reliability of 10 papers and (ii) indirectly the reliability of the meta-analysis study. Method We obtained copies of each of the 10 papers used in a metaanalysis paper and counted the numbers of outcomes, predictors, and covariates. We estimate the size of the potential analysis search space available to the authors of these papers; i. e. the number of comparisons and models available. The potential analysis search space is the number of outcomes times the number of predictors times 2 c , where c is the number of covariates. This formula was applied to information found in the abstracts (Space A) as well as the text (Space T) of each base paper. Results The median and range of the number of comparisons possible across the base papers are 6.5 and (2 12,288), respectively for Space A, and 196,608 and (3072–117,117,952), respectively for Space T. It is noted that the median of 6.5 for Space A may be misleading as each study has 60–165 foods that could be predictors. Conclusion Given that testing is at the 5% level and the number of comparisons is very large, nominal statistical significance is very weak support for a claim. The claims in these papers are not statistically supported and hence are unreliable so the meta-analysis paper is also unreliable.","inCitations":["480e41d2246f16cc9ad93b9a19dbb9819fd95386"],"title":"A Serious Flaw in Nutrition Epidemiology: A Meta-Analysis Study","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2018-0079"}

The continual reassessment method for partial orders (PO-CRM) is a design for phase I trials of combinations that leans upon identifying possible complete orders associated with the partial order. This article addresses some practical design considerations not previously undertaken when describing the PO-CRM. We describe an approach in choosing a proper subset of possible orderings, formulated according to the known toxicity relationships within a matrix of combination therapies. Other design issues, such as working model selection and stopping rules, are also discussed.

Several statistical methods have been proposed for the design and evaluation of multiregional trials. However, in most of the recent approaches for sample size determination in multiregional trials, a common treatment effect of the primary endpoint across regions is usually assumed. In practice, it might be expected that there is a difference in treatment effect due to regional difference (e.g., ethnic difference). In this article, a random effect model for heterogeneous treatment effect across regions is proposed for the design and evaluation of multiregional trials. We also address consideration of the determination of the number of subjects in a specific region to establish the consistency of treatment effects between the specific region and the entire group.","inCitations":["9dd6a9fbee97451c6d4012a2697564aa707a770c","a146dad1cf294f3445f4f400bd251e22512a42e5","500653e6a559079a5aa52883f3532562be77b66d","5c7fbcde955cf71cb6f9abcafe937d1ec5c8ac8a","cc738e36bd4663b0b2d794147f2d99b3f4accb85","43263dda5943b4e9e086c10425ecada9c55883e2","f2d50a09e063f9de6ca2b1e1c45fb17e5ce3d8a4","6ea0386a2e635cac2f5b2e0015047cc809c0b47c","b12dc3f2ba8fa678e9096d87df132e4562cfeadc"],"title":"Design and evaluation of multiregional trials with heterogeneous treatment effect across regions.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.701585"}

Determining the transition point of the disease trajectory to a more severe state is important clinically for disease management and for avoiding irreversible vision loss. Based on this, we present a unified statistical modeling framework that permits prediction of the timing and spatial location of future vision loss and informs clinical decisions regarding disease progression. The developed method incorporates anatomical information to create a biologically plausible data-generating model. We accomplish this by introducing a spatially varying coefficients model that includes spatially varying change points to detect structural shifts in both the mean and variance process of VF data across both space and time. The VF location-specific change point represents the underlying, and potentially censored, timing of true change in disease trajectory while a multivariate spatial boundary detection structure is introduced that accounts for the complex spatial connectivity of the VF and optic disc. We show that our method improves estimation and prediction of multiple aspects of disease management in comparison to existing methods through simulation and real data application. The R package spCP implements the new methodology.","inCitations":["d621c6e047cb66b3b5c3fb85cf22f91253f01315"],"title":"A spatially varying change points model for monitoring glaucoma progression using visual field data.","doi":"10.1016/j.spasta.2019.02.001"}

However, in designing an active-comparator trial where a sample of responses from the new treatment is available but the patient response data to the comparator are limited to summary statistics, the existing methods are either inapplicable or poorly behaved. In this paper we develop a new method for active-comparator trials assuming the responses from both treatments are from the same location-scale family. Theories and simulations have shown that the new method performs well when the location-scale assumption holds and works reasonably when the assumption does not hold. Thus, the new method is preferred when computing sample sizes for the van Elteren test in active-comparator trials.","inCitations":["8c478757a61412a3e5e0f1972d2cf16f1f1b49cf"],"title":"Power approximation for the van Elteren test based on location-scale family of distributions.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600762939"}

Estimating the cumulative risk is difficult, however, when the estimates are based on family history data. Often, the genetic mutation status in many family members is unknown; instead, only estimated probabilities of a patient having a certain mutation status are available. Also, ages of disease-onset are subject to right censoring. Existing methods to estimate the cumulative risk using such family-based data only provide estimation at individual time points, and are not guaranteed to be monotonic, nor non-negative. In this paper, we develop a novel method that combines Expectation-Maximization and isotonic regression to estimate the cumulative risk across the entire support. Our estimator is monotonic, satisfies self-consistent estimating equations, and has high power in detecting differences between the cumulative risks of different populations. Application of our estimator to a Parkinson's disease (PD) study provides the age-at-onset distribution of PD in PARK2 mutation carriers and non-carriers, and reveals a significant difference between the distribution in compound heterozygous carriers compared to non-carriers, but not between heterozygous carriers and non-carriers.","inCitations":["6dcc5552e18ec3111c9af1247d9b66a3585824e4","dbbad0b8fd2a230f6854ab8a469fb43918006f76","72d0441183782527b4ac347e787d9588dbd2fefb"],"title":"Combining Isotonic Regression and Em Algorithm to Predict Genetic Risk under Monotonicity Constraint.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS730"}

These procedures retain the high efficiency of Wilcoxon methods for simple location problems and are based on a fitting criterion which is robust to outliers in response space. A simple weighting scheme can be employed so that the procedures are robust to outliers in factor (design) space as well as response space. These rank-based analyses offer a complete analysis, including estimation of fixed effects and their standard errors, and tests of linear hypotheses.

Analyzing these data poses several challenges. Several types of measurements are taken at many locations throughout the mouth. These spatially-referenced data are a mix of binary and continuous responses, making joint modeling difficult. Also, most patients have missing teeth. Periodontal disease is a leading cause of tooth loss, so it is likely that the number and location of missing teeth informs about the patient's periodontal health. In this paper we develop a multivariate spatial framework for these data which jointly models the binary and continuous responses as a function of a single latent spatial process representing general periodontal health. We also use the latent spatial process to model the location of missing teeth. We show using simulated and real data that exploiting spatial associations and jointly modeling the responses and locations of missing teeth mitigates the problems presented by these data.","inCitations":["8e584c1a333282189848151db2437ac8765b65cb","268b12424118408aa84683dd82c296d0c23a90bb","a7d632902364b36970df21738ecacc100afaffb1","b9d0d0fd084e7746462d058cc9bc656ac9d68909","f26309cc62966daefa080295af80ae7b1ec0323f","26898caa3926c1d94dc8231ea779d290953baac8","81b6d9cd52c0c061f1b358a77ae9bd0511b24b51","192941c463e1be6620b82baf220ba98e90400d36","feb6cfe41f6fa151df85a73c232062c739c6ce97","ff56a2f1802eb6842a829a40d8512dc6617507d0","382ea8af78db6b0ab4ebf92aa8e733666fd3b6b0","39026e4e76700956fee2c3418e938e25c4127016","a2fa01ae3b6fb7b00a42a65da548dbec7eeea44f","dce7dc51b645e384636fb4471d425b8f10633e0e","eaea7f20599e4c4a4e79aad62b07386e95e844d6","a8a52b576e2e486c047a3050be4aca58182521a8","ebcf8f896c9bf56bee580ce3545a45baff50fd08"],"title":"A Latent Factor Model for Spatial Data with Informative Missingness.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS278"}

This design first randomizes patients into non-marker-based or marker-based strategies. Patients allocated to the non-marker-based strategy are then further randomized to receive either the standard or targeted treatments, while patients allocated to the marker-based strategy receive treatments based on their marker statuses. Little research has been done on the statistical properties of the MSD, which has led to some widespread misconceptions and placed clinical researchers at high risk of using inefficient designs. In this article, we show that the commonly used between-strategy comparison has low power to detect the predictive effect and is valid only under a restrictive condition that the randomization ratio within the non-marker-based strategy matches the marker prevalence. We propose a Wald test that is generally valid and also uniformly more powerful than the between-strategy comparison. Based on that, we derive an optimal MSD that maximizes the power to detect the predictive marker effect by choosing the optimal randomization ratios between the two strategies and treatments. Our numerical study shows that using the proposed optimal designs can substantially improve the power of the MSD to detect the predictive marker effect. We use a lung cancer trial to illustrate the proposed optimal designs.","inCitations":["9761d7da47664f7bc13ba946868b86fa26f3150f"],"title":"Optimal marker-strategy clinical trial design to detect predictive markers for targeted therapy.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw006"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2004,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The aim of this report is to describe the use of WinBUGS for two datasets that arise from typical population pharmacokinetic studies. The first dataset relates to gentamicin concentration-time data that arose as part of routine clinical care of 55 neonates. The second dataset incorporated data from 96 patients receiving enoxaparin. Both datasets were originally analyzed by using NONMEM. In the first instance, although NONMEM provided reasonable estimates of the fixed effects parameters it was unable to provide satisfactory estimates of the between-subject variance. In the second instance, the use of NONMEM resulted in the development of a successful model, albeit with limited available information on the between-subject variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters. WinBUGS was used to develop a model for both of these datasets. Model comparison for the enoxaparin dataset was performed by using the posterior distribution of the log-likelihood and a posterior predictive check. The use of WinBUGS supported the same structural models tried in NONMEM. For the gentamicin dataset a one-compartment model with intravenous infusion was developed, and the population parameters including the full between-subject variance-covariance matrix were available. Analysis of the enoxaparin dataset supported a two compartment model as superior to the one-compartment model, based on the posterior predictive check. Again, the full between-subject variance-covariance matrix parameters were available. Fully Bayesian approaches using MCMC methods, via WinBUGS, can offer added value for analysis of population pharmacokinetic data.","inCitations":["354eaa679918d58bb411b3b9c8239ceb44b13375","bd338db9b090cb2d1664c8a669098a44efc40405","cca22ff79e6cb8309f63de0e5bc501ae24068bb6","8c6285fba79edb4524e61f6a76694ca4e33e4f2d","74e6cd8727391dea8dacea82304c302ae4d118cc","beccf98c9889a77e4ea6a08be0ad4334a44340c7","035b396e011ef45d9979fb0b59429b7fae0648aa","0cc9d7ed21645d6ffc81b1b55568876f855e9c83","b1abe182f5f0bbf364b7688d26e6f74486e5ec2b","cbf4c23f2301f6d42052c6881fa5bd64a51e7f19","57facccb679e90ec9f8cd4ea9fa0ddebd12333c2","43846226eaf482b8bf91da7f38e7065a9d127c6a","58030bdc208186e54029d2a76091b4bf5922ac2d","a19564ab7fbb549fd42d0448cfd6c68bb1209480","b01186ba4740aac5bc15bc09384e98b9e77b401d","253973b164c4d29b9d1d000c530215184f7370d7","f464926757db64972a4732795b7cbbf39a8c7b4d","2474dba159cccc0fb95bee88247e1389db4c940b","1ce543c15a42cc3446fe03b26885b45552fba2d1","e1f783527929523fbda0c195718d4c409b7688e3","3ae80cad8aaf11ff4bb17e3f9caeafdaaa9f9287","a3b5ab1cdfddaf1305d6e74d7ab4c1f3cda618ab","fbcd6f5653ac3b06f0eb6957e00aed46ad1aa128","73e1948a1783422b6d63e35c22e458defd5b0fd7","150fb4d235b5ebfc38a054837e1ac69202da182f","d628bd66ddfaf06abee470da11f58bf278513024","a5e6040146844180e04a7b743f1d1ba84345db26","03aa2d034edf8a9772f7714386792da59be0b507","2f8c0a4f9c59b083cb1e0df225ac2f3f07986cc4","f225699beabbc82c0712cf6fae2d6ad52b0c1d2e","dea719267c08fe323c7734df855f880eba1a6281","9b957cb0fe3c215f3ecaaa2f96705598274436f7"],"title":"Analysis of population pharmacokinetic data using NONMEM and WinBUGS.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200040824"}

Partition-based regression typically introduce a quality-of-fit-driven decomposition of the domain. The emphasis in this work is on a topologically meaningful segmentation. Thus, the proposed regression approach is based on a segmentation induced by a discrete approximation of the Morse-Smale complex. This yields a segmentation with partitions corresponding to regions of the function with a single minimum and maximum that are often well approximated by a linear model. This approach yields regression models that are amenable to interpretation and have good predictive capacity. Typically, regression estimates are quantified by their geometrical accuracy. For the proposed regression, an important aspect is the quality of the segmentation itself. Thus, this paper introduces a new criterion that measures the topological accuracy of the estimate. The topological accuracy provides a complementary measure to the classical geometrical error measures and is very sensitive to over-fitting. The Morse-Smale regression is compared to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of geometry and topology and yields comparable or improved fits in many cases. Finally, a detailed study on climate-simulation data demonstrates the application of the Morse-Smale regression. Supplementary materials are available online and contain an implementation of the proposed approach in the R package msr, an analysis and simulations on the stability of the Morse-Smale complex approximation and additional tables for the climate-simulation study.","inCitations":["0210bc01add41fce94924b90e57a3e620f436ca1","c240fa74338b2c236e0c07703b587d08d7f36378","b27c6a00b8522ca4251b962e1f8c4e00974ebd59","bb55f2ac9db695d7bef1ed9953b2f064ff28a92d","825279cba4326bc8fe2fe666a48ab0126e9da5f2","3ae7e6153f40bfe338a1e4219663715ba00ed693","2630ded6ef425114d729534c17d731031b8d101b","a775a73581a50f6560641dcf47a2a33293a2b9f5","fc9e60f370252bc9a6120a6b2c39703ac1fee810"],"title":"Morse-Smale Regression.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2012.657132"}

In previous papers and software, the asymptotic null distribution of likelihood ratio tests for detecting genetic linkage in multivariate variance components models has been stated to be a mixture of chi-square distributions with binomial mixing probabilities. For variance components models under the complete pleiotropy assumption, we show by simulation and by theoretical arguments based on the geometry of the parameter space that all aspects of the previously stated asymptotic null distribution are incorrect-both the binomial mixing probabilities and the chi-square components. Correcting the null distribution gives more conservative critical values than previously stated, yielding P values that can easily be 10 times larger. The true mixing probabilities give the highest probability to the case where all variance parameters are estimated positive, and the mixing components show severe departures from chi-square distributions. Thus, the asymptotic null distribution has complex features that raise challenges for the assessment of significance of multivariate linkage findings. We propose a method to generate an asymptotic null distribution that is much faster than other empirical methods such as permutation, enabling us to obtain P values with higher precision more efficiently.","inCitations":["7876eb17a7c437bd5c41761b4ac98ef76da5ae34","6ea811e1ae543ca3e55c94c9c9bebe8b990e7b82","bb27eb9bf0b0e3e120d053b9278fb82a60ff7c03"],"title":"Reconsidering the asymptotic null distribution of likelihood ratio tests for genetic linkage in multivariate variance components models under complete pleiotropy.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp054"}

This is especially so when the clinical trials are randomized according to minimization, which is a popular covariate-adaptive randomization method for ensuring balance among prognostic factors. Among various re-randomization tests, fixed-entry-order re-randomization is advocated as an effective strategy when a temporal trend is suspected. Yet when the minimization is applied to trials with unequal allocation, fixed-entry-order re-randomization test is biased and thus compromised in power. We find that the bias is due to non-uniform re-allocation probabilities incurred by the re-randomization in this case. We therefore propose a weighted fixed-entry-order re-randomization test to overcome the bias. The performance of the new test was investigated in simulation studies that mimic the settings of a real clinical trial. The weighted re-randomization test was found to work well in the scenarios investigated including the presence of a strong temporal trend.","inCitations":["e1e698e1b563fa466cd40ff8bcf2174655bfeb40","3771e23f1fc85ebbc326607523010dfb924ae022"],"title":"Weighted re-randomization tests for minimization with unbalanced allocation.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1577"}

The model allows dependence of random coefficients on covariate information and accommodates general specifications of a common intraindividual covariance structure, such as models for variance within individuals that depend on individual mean response and autocorrelation. Two classes of procedures for estimation in this model are described, which incorporate estimation of unknown parameters in the assumed intraindividual covariance structure. The procedures are straightforward to implement using standard statistical software. The techniques are illustrated by examples in growth analysis and assay development.","inCitations":["fb9e66824eac09d09bd011c956b0aa5ffae31511","eb1e399dbe001b195d27da7ad70df54029d20838","8f4331031f2840513664388028950f09adb14d60","6bcc6e3834a55b36a937e9e02cf9b38f46410d49","940ecaf79ffca7ebb39deea764e9d32d47b12033","c6f61f5fc61d3a999361531ed2c551bf0f177e1a","47c9a8f20a08db23a5b077592d48f5cee2308fa7","c63eb6069f0d8209c45ed11124612615cecb29bd","b7b4765686489b84993b60f6cbbf61e23425921b","e93a9f36a7d0116b2c2aaba12ac15d4094f8920d","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","0cc9d7ed21645d6ffc81b1b55568876f855e9c83","9add94351a5ca19b522cc42bf0421d673e4b2633","6d2f831251497e1042f0ab9c0f5a8e48ba4c7783","2443786945836a614b9a99eb80b12dca77e2ce2c","84b583b9b95e2c262b24db4a2a62fb4b6e7eb110","786e5fb1196989d753296e0fb6ff4ea19501f054","5050213b4d7feead17d3daad63c488afa313fa0b","71dd84e54a8f8f1390ea424b0ac75e02d5ef9848","8c84029e7bccc992e5fae3f92ccb71508a447357","95939e6772728617ede2185c14aa9253b55a5d67","70aa01b578b5e6e4029d46f5d451362c66e88301","0d7668164d62b829c93f4f768185fa47a710def4","c90290f75da10342b89fcb1b7f2f131327bad68d","11395d27d18326c9fd40f15c4c71f97b094e036b","851a084d707e10e04496b897eaa1cef7d6556677","9ac33c8824ef0572f9a601f6cf9d6be0118c3685","87ec08e5005e4e4f7e922f5f5252b6717971faa2","15d581381606360bbf9ba0b99c97434fd55694c2","ba2fd4f35ca8386b2b0c18d8f5f3be99118643cb","a3358653ae2d5928205498463766f468d0b3fcb8","43a52b7945abdcc1f71a6694666219f73ffb1a13","4e57bdab6e59e63db9172ee7b9f0a155aa90dd29","9c265528aa0f42cd98e1a98bbb3ef9ccfb0ea1b8","71cef2fcd949e6e2eef9773175912560b6b537dd","9e56be6fdaff360208060d81c9854544cb68f633"],"title":"Some general estimation methods for nonlinear mixed-effects models.","doi":"10.1080/10543409308835047"}

We focus on the mechanism of missing at random and variable selection methods that can be combined with imputation. We investigate a general resampling approach (BI-SS) that combines bootstrap imputation and stability selection, the latter of which was developed for fully observed data. The proposed approach is general and can be applied to a wide range of settings. Our extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the performance of BI-SS is the best or close to the best and is relatively insensitive to tuning parameter values in terms of variable selection, compared with several existing methods for both low-dimensional and high-dimensional problems. The proposed approach is further illustrated using two applications, one for a low-dimensional problem and the other for a high-dimensional problem.","inCitations":["21aab5bccf63e1f7a7e5676c129f7ad5a53eb84e","792ec1fca65ada2ee787f2cc4f8bce591930ed22","f84d660377e448e552947cba440e0083da03246a","29d240f5da39dc7321ab23bcde7c6fc8903af16f","229bc0300c46eb351951de6f6d19f067cd8a1224","f3ffa09bcb742d3ba95902fc94e7955171cf770c","80b40380bde435a1ca93472c8aeee11d402767ba","ad2f5e63cac43a283f65a196bb11973e4238fcaa","b44aad04b2380451bcdefd37277894a05249b6ec"],"title":"Variable selection in the presence of missing data: resampling and imputation.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv003"}
