Whilst relevant empirical data should, where possible, provide the basis for such priors, it is often the case that limitations in data and/or our understanding may preclude direct construction of a data-based prior. Formal expert elicitation methods are a key technique that can be used to determine priors in these situations. Within GlaxoSmithKline, we have adopted a structured approach to prior elicitation on the basis of the SHELF elicitation framework and routinely use this in conjunction with calculation of probability of success (assurance) of the next study(s) to inform internal decision making at key project milestones. The aim of this paper is to share our experiences of embedding the use of prior elicitation within a large pharmaceutical company, highlighting both the benefits and challenges of prior elicitation through a series of case studies. We have found that putting team beliefs into the shape of a quantitative probability distribution provides a firm anchor for all internal decision making, enabling teams to provide investment boards with formally appropriate estimates of the probability of trial success as well as robust plans for interim decision rules where appropriate. As an added benefit, the elicitation process provides transparency about the beliefs and risks of the potential medicine, ultimately enabling better portfolio and company-wide decision making.","inCitations":["0a633fededccc495533befd3347d8a9f50441ed3","0368802af7cd6e24a24eb1764760b92b40211761","3e40b25866259a39d3bad799c3480ee52f29612d"],"title":"Better decision making in drug development through adoption of formal prior elicitation.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1854"}

Typically, there is no single standard endpoint to assess the toxicity or efficacy of the compound of interest, but co-primary endpoints are available to assess the toxic effects or the working of the compound. Modeling the responses jointly is thus appealing to draw overall inferences using all responses and to capture the association among the responses. Non-Gaussian outcomes are often modeled univariately using exponential family models. To accommodate both the overdispersion and hierarchical structure in the data, Molenberghs et al. A family of generalized linear models for repeated measures with normal and conjugate random effects. Statistical Science 2010; 25:325-347 proposed using two separate sets of random effects. This papers considers a model for multivariate data with hierarchically clustered and overdispersed non-Gaussian data. Gamma random effect for the over-dispersion and normal random effects for the clustering in the data are being used. The two outcomes are jointly analyzed by assuming that the normal random effects for both endpoints are correlated. The association structure between the response is analytically derived. The fit of the joint model to data from a so-called comet assay are compared with the univariate analysis of the two outcomes.","inCitations":["c908f6b22638c7964ffcd791524bc64a7b79e3f2","0625e209294f6e1c0c3af58cad6a9de405fea6fb"],"title":"Joint modeling of hierarchically clustered and overdispersed non-gaussian continuous outcomes for comet assay data.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1533"}

The current statistical method for evaluation of the linearity recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guideline EP6-A is reviewed. The method directly compares the point estimates with the pre-specified allowable limit and completely ignores the sampling error of the point estimates. An alternative method for evaluation of linearity, proposed by Kroll et al. (2000), considers the statistical test procedure based on the average deviation from linearity (ADL). However this procedure is based on an inappropriate formulation of hypotheses for the evaluation of linearity. Consequently, the type I error rates of both current methods may be inflated for inference of linearity. To claim the linearity of analytical methods, we propose that the hypothesis of proving the linearity should be formulated as the alternative hypothesis. Furthermore, any procedures for assessment of linearity should be based on the sampling distributions of the proposed test statistics. Therefore, we propose a two one-sided test (TOST) procedure and a corrected Kroll's procedure. The simulation studies were conducted to empirically compare the size and power between current and proposed methods. The simulation results show that the proposed methods not only adequately control size but also provide sufficient power. A numeric example illustrates the proposed methods.","inCitations":["5be248404b8745c93ba1da570ce0bc6aaa2badcf","b083de04c8f9a3965a6a5b154e1310388c94a5bf","84475cb1a0d3d784c0dcdadf313375ab8564b87f","9b1dbb3c2f7b34a67119547b92259b772c340392"],"title":"On statistical evaluation of the linearity in assay validation.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802071378"}

Under some additional assumptions, it follows that the item category response functions (ICRFs) can be closely approximated by the ICRFs of the standard GRM with equal item discrimination. For fixed item locations, the item responses depend on two individual differences parameters: the person central location and the person reliability. Procedures for estimating the person parameters and for addressing the goodness of fit of the proposed model as compared to the standard GRM are discussed. The accuracy of the person estimates is assessed by means of simulation studies.

Using data-adaptive weights, the adaptive Lasso modified the original procedure to increase the penalty terms for those variables estimated to be less important by ordinary least squares. Although this modified procedure attained the oracle properties, the resulting models tend to include a large number of \"false positives\" in practice. Here, we adapt the concept of local false discovery rates (lFDRs) so that it applies to the sequence, λn, of smoothing parameters for the adaptive Lasso. We define the lFDR for a given λn to be the probability that the variable added to the model by decreasing λn to λn-δ is not associated with the outcome, where δ is a small value. We derive the relationship between the lFDR and λn, show lFDR =1 for traditional smoothing parameters, and show how to select λn so as to achieve a desired lFDR. We compare the smoothing parameters chosen to achieve a specified lFDR and those chosen to achieve the oracle properties, as well as their resulting estimates for model coefficients, with both simulation and an example from a genetic study of prostate specific antigen.","inCitations":["9cbec8a2c5ac76355eb195e440f741196ee4f22e","4f66c5f894d82de33fcdf8572efea0e15f8c017e","f929f5f354a4597cd4f888684f45ed60bb9efc2d","360474c808f09978947480d1542661fc32a9113d","996e3aad75caff4926f54ec6a3753df4a3a60981","732646698061a67103da4e71d426e5246019ce91","5114287fb4969e2c5a89acb7409b2253f8665366","e05ceb23f539ff69892d91e57cb8b2e6a74e9fa0"],"title":"Controlling the local false discovery rate in the adaptive Lasso.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt008"}

A Bayesian hierarchical approach is typically used to produce such maps, which represents the risk surface with a set of random effects that exhibit a single global level of spatial smoothness. However, in complex urban settings, the risk surface is likely to exhibit localized rather than global spatial structure, including areas where the risk varies smoothly over space, as well as boundaries separating populations that are geographically adjacent but have very different risk profiles. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach for capturing localized spatial structure, including the identification of such risk boundaries. The effectiveness of the approach is tested by simulation, before being applied to lung cancer incidence data in Greater Glasgow, UK, between 2001 and 2005.","inCitations":["0142ef983b143df359b85602c9699c93e0981437","8a20a640420100a5037f4905cabd378aa27cdd3c","4c1c351ab8eb75e1b8b55ee78cc9c1db83c73502","bb297f13ac1375798d25b24e7c385b03893be69c","a24b4da08ba5ab92b88d88a4496a3179c7f7610b","85d657a9fcc6020ec74f0e05a19a36fb74217524","7e78b08da00f466cb4406d1056ea1be9551c655b","4dd0807ac94077a75561a3e78eefa7bc37a3f66f","b3a896d07ae9f88f571232e3e70fb97c2f5719fc","971afc8b75a7b52ab9e5b56814bc3bd55470bb3a","20e32ca5925e8462d75a59ad4e2722a849f365a2","0386f8aa79bc9dbfd3dd487ddc59197b001ff253","b3366da4acbabab340162352080c52e326f39d2b","602e12f41f63ec38c86f4be0ddb62f53b2e6f606","1e129594ecfe79ce3e972bd0f52f971b7ce4dcea","f4bd108e95add7bbc42ed2770e723201164fbeae","b7585833a97c52542d4cb5241fed61ec62e09694","5f896a13a9fe3298ebd1bb7d27985b6203e7a180","5b51551aef961ffcfa0be7efddf40c111aa026da","123006d8d3b8aa39d8b71e321a9f052389f3f887","e3d94e33ccc1de1deb3c7041fa3a3a14597962ef","c020f87b0c449e2c77cce53292c793b47d8ab027","871f54291032571d2145fb13fe4cce42bd79c10b","95b18642faa6d1e2222e6cf52d99b2d858e6d982","bc50c46dbe0d91184168ed5ce88657c5dc8b992f","bbcee888edd8adc06ff5eb60aafeff4139d9f237","d6bcac3970eed5e36b7ff1edbf81e107bae11823","240b7f92b811b1909519e4406dc8cf3dba3ed446","0ecc553b4280821e7cc89eabf7329e859f9ae235","8716eec8c8bd3932bc8a66308b42f5754f6f729d","c857683907468dee67dcc375917945af83a372f3","5882feeec221d1607b9342b27a2952f7005361d3","c3997bf815f91f8b37001b4246b859528eb8e28c"],"title":"Boundary detection in disease mapping studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr036"}

An efficient process can help us identify safety signals early and afford us the opportunity to develop effective risk minimization plan early in the development cycle. This awareness has led many pharmaceutical sponsors to set up internal systems and structures to effectively conduct safety assessment at all levels (patient, study, and program). In addition to process, tools have emerged that are designed to enhance data review and pattern recognition. In this paper, we describe advancements in the practice of safety assessment during the premarketing phase of drug development.

When the group membership is at level 2, multilevel factorial invariance can be tested by a simple extension of the standard procedure. However level-1 group membership raises problems which cannot be appropriately handled by the standard procedure, because the dependency between members of different level-1 groups is not appropriately taken into account. The procedure presented in this article provides a solution to this problem.

Owing to a substantial variability in FDP for correlated genes, some authors considered controlling actual FDP, instead of its expectation, that is false discovery rate, in multiple testing. However, there has been no attempt to do this in the design of microarray experiments. In this article, we develop a procedure for sample size calculation to control the distributions of FDP and true positives simultaneously under blockwise correlation structures among genes. The sizes of gene blocks, correlation coefficients, and effect sizes within gene blocks can vary across gene blocks. Gene clustering is proposed to identify gene blocks using historical data sets. The adequacy of the procedure is demonstrated using simulated data sets. An application to a clinical study for lymphoma is also provided.","inCitations":["2352260cf0eb99321b34c57be2424679cf957d87","2f7629fd282412ab180d9a4974dfa4fec995656b","79570a9c85579963cb8854e79c2fc4b7173d9528","7354e82d8d53ef2fe8bd904700ec95ca78599f81"],"title":"Sample size calculations for controlling the distribution of false discovery proportion in microarray experiments.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp024"}

After an intervention, disease status is re-diagnosed with the same fallible instrument. Potential misclassification in the diagnostic test causes regression to the mean that biases inferences about the true intervention effect. The existing likelihood approach suffers in situations where either sensitivity or specificity is near 1. In such cases, common in many diagnostic tests, confidence interval coverage can often be below nominal for the likelihood approach. Another potential drawback of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) method is that it requires validation data to eliminate identification problems. We propose a Bayesian approach that offers improved performance in general, but substantially better performance than the MLE method in the realistic case of a highly accurate diagnostic test. We obtain this superior performance using no more information than that employed in the likelihood method. Our approach is also more flexible, doing without validation data if necessary, but accommodating multiple sources of information, if available, thereby systematically eliminating identification problems. We show via a simulation study that our Bayesian approach outperforms the MLE method, especially when the diagnostic test has high sensitivity, specificity, or both. We also consider a real data example for which the diagnostic test specificity is close to 1 (false positive probability close to 0).","inCitations":["a137cbadf8d239ba82b4213f512f344d8e2b161e","65c2114726c6c44090f11ccf593d2f794f86eafa","d6738005b3f5e1a3f8b3e1c1649bee3b2bedd400"],"title":"Bayesian estimation of intervention effect with pre- and post-misclassified binomial data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400601001493"}

Important examples are treatment-subgroup interactions in clinical trials, and gene-gene or gene-environment interactions in genomic studies. A common problem when implementing a variable selection algorithm in such settings is the requirement that the model must satisfy the strong heredity constraint, wherein an interaction may be included in the model only if the interaction's component variables are included as main effects. We propose a modified Lasso method for the Cox regression model that adaptively selects important single covariates and pairwise interactions while enforcing the strong heredity constraint. The proposed method is based on a modified log partial likelihood including two adaptively weighted penalties, one for main effects and one for interactions. A two-dimensional tuning parameter for the penalties is determined by generalized cross-validation. Asymptotic properties are established, including consistency and rate of convergence, and it is shown that the proposed selection procedure has oracle properties, given proper choice of regularization parameters. Simulations illustrate that the proposed method performs reliably across a range of different scenarios.","inCitations":["89fb8c2bd76165271e19e83dba8ab687552b6526","2254fe46de9139aa1321ef24a6ee3b98943fe060","a9c8102262bb73586bda22e99d8ac1ab1bf79e1e","aa9d4455043e7a9acf0549378dfd5f1484520078"],"title":"A Modified Adaptive Lasso for Identifying Interactions in the Cox Model with the Heredity Constraint.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2014.06.024"}

The model has a continuous state space, with 1 state representing a normal copy number of 2, and the rest of the states being either amplifications or deletions. We adopt a Bayesian approach and apply Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for estimating the parameters and the Markov process. The model can be applied to data from both tiling bacterial artificial chromosome arrays and oligonucleotide arrays.

An estimation and inference procedure is developed by generalizing the celebrated Powell's (1984, 1986) estimator for censored quantile regression. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator are established. An algorithm is devised to attain good computational efficiency.

We describe two approaches to parameter estimation: a fast algorithm, based on the expectation-maximization and the iterated conditional modes algorithms, and a fully Bayesian framework.

The sample size calculation for such a trial often assumes fixed follow-up time for each patient. In many trials, however, we follow all patients for a predetermined follow-up time after the end of the accrual period, in which case the follow-up time is variable. This article provides methods for sample size calculation for clinical trials with ordinary Poisson count data and variable follow-up time allowing for nonuniform accrual and early dropouts. We also generalize the sample size formula to count data with overdispersion.","inCitations":["49c9d9a00849f2cc639496e1ba33d1a9c10d172e"],"title":"Sample size calculation for count data in comparative clinical trials with nonuniform patient accrual and early dropout.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.919935"}

More specifically, we address how different levels of univariate kurtosis affect fit values (and therefore fit indices) for misspecified factor models. By using numerical calculation, we show (for 13 factor models) that the probability limit F(0) of F empty set for the ADF fit function decreases considerably as the kurtosis increases. We also give a formal proof that the value of F(0) decreases monotonically with the kurtosis for a whole class of structural equation models.","inCitations":["ebd8858e27697fb5aad514dc40c16db4384e6a38","4fc833b6c6474945a499b5d4c9177a236c4a6689","af0e6d64b302ce8c10313920ea641751d7a65033","903d068cd4bf36b6f7666867864a47b15ae41a30","741f5949a9429bbffcb400fe03acc0b04aa42cee","1cdd4ca38516c5c1a4f7d6f8adfe55116be28b39"],"title":"Does the ADF fit function decrease when the kurtosis increases?","doi":"10.1348/000711003770480057"}

Instead, given knowledge of the chemical characteristics of known sources, investigators infer pollution source contributions via a source apportionment or multivariate receptor analysis applied to a large number of observed elemental concentrations. Although source apportionment methods are well established for exposure assessment, little work has been done to evaluate the appropriateness of characterizing unobservable sources thus in health effects analyses. In this article, we propose a structural equation framework to assess source-specific health effects using speciated elemental data. This approach corresponds to fitting a receptor model and the health outcome model jointly, such that inferences on the health effects account for the fact that uncertainty is associated with the source contributions. Since the structural equation model (SEM) typically involves a large number of parameters, for small-sample settings, we propose a fully Bayesian estimation approach that leverages historical exposure data from previous related exposure studies. We compare via simulation the performance of our approach in estimating source-specific health effects to that of 2 existing approaches, a tracer approach and a 2-stage approach. Simulation results suggest that the proposed informative Bayesian SEM is effective in eliminating the bias incurred by the 2 existing approaches, even when the number of exposures is limited. We employ the proposed methods in the analysis of a concentrator study investigating the association between ST-segment, a cardiovascular outcome, and major sources of Boston PM and discuss the implications of our findings with respect to the design of future PM concentrator studies.","inCitations":["40bfbf47faf20105864e53ade0a44d4ee7585c0d","73cea7905fb31be52b104c04f4d626c95a125699","3b4eeac3fbab6b00e52191b7a9419162d1470562","dbc15e5f73ebc7b87d0c9c3c4b161ceb3c052795","10c6cebb3e24d6e7684e9ef0e4446c498c392107","78c85d96e883412558389296e7f36f3396a55bbd","3797802aba9e66cb83e5cdc005b4733bde2c9fa6","19657288cc9f06b34aa3c5f6360b08c815cd2843","b44ab8ce971e6c7ec1a0ea2fc78573d10179ae30","26bcd8e57d05ebab8d1feddd824b22e8ffb6e34e","912229492dc41206b55f1232782962db746b976b","69f2b706ea87a2edbfee43a363840b68fdae7ee2","b2d427e2fcc345067692679cd6c70f71f2fc1430","8855177783598a869a75f087657193148c52592d","0768a5238bf512fb6751339c2408587d98862a84","ccb4ad6ab44b04efdc51f191b0a8a22c88e78b10","d1031e58df116c952d67503976a0a10e4e69b197","e2d5bd92dbe98519e248d84cb2051ac59ab73f86","eb679fced59e64f2f1f7084f09fb5b926829391d","d344f84a1edb0efd62e2df913961b788bcacee25"],"title":"An informative Bayesian structural equation model to assess source-specific health effects of air pollution.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl032"}

Furthermore, because of ethical reasons or patient's decision, it is not uncommon to encounter data in which there are patients not complying with their assigned treatments. Thus, the development of a sample size calculation procedure for a CRT with noncompliance is important and useful in practice. Under the exclusion restriction model, we have developed an asymptotic test procedure using a tanh(-1)(x) transformation for testing equality between two treatments among compliers for a CRT with noncompliance. We have further derived a sample size formula accounting for both noncompliance and the intraclass correlation for a desired power 1 - β at a nominal α level. We have employed Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed test procedure with respect to type I error and the accuracy of the derived sample size calculation formula with respect to power in a variety of situations. Finally, we use the data taken from a CRT studying vitamin A supplementation to reduce mortality among preschool children to illustrate the use of sample size calculation proposed here.","inCitations":["52ecac6de4c9052dea33b55efa9f6992aa2aaf6c","f34d58ab76ceaef311b192cefc795f1e837bc57f"],"title":"Sample size determination for testing equality in a cluster randomized trial with noncompliance.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903350465"}

However, these assumptions are often untenable in practice because of the influence of local effects in the correlation structure. Therefore, it has been of prolonged interest in the literature to provide flexible and effective ways to model non-stationarity in the spatial effects. Arguably, due to the local nature of the problem, we might envision that the correlation structure would be highly dependent on local characteristics of the domain of study, namely the latitude, longitude and altitude of the observation sites, as well as other locally defined covariate information. In this work, we provide a flexible and computationally feasible way for allowing the correlation structure of the underlying processes to depend on local covariate information. We discuss the properties of the induced covariance functions and discuss methods to assess its dependence on local covariate information by means of a simulation study and the analysis of data observed at ozone-monitoring stations in the Southeast United States.","inCitations":["7ccc6e0ea855ece6c4384752f07ea017689ecbe8","352b05e0ec9225e53b98cbd78cebdb9751827ec3","8d5660da80719ca8d2bc73489d4feb6a4fe63d16","afbc305238cd696af92575c256629222dc658ded","5f80ed9814ae48ac0b7495d727e90db12fab7511","ee6f6883d08303d73dd12e1224e58302dde55b5d","74662411520399049199f2ce0429a678018b090b","de7a2d142d2415cb9fe8750eeebd73b5559ac818","601df49295bce16ecf551a39bffbe2eab095171c","263c5ee497084a9203675d6d764b0928b0716256","5896b705131c0df1469480c70e5d019fd96ef72b","9a24d309cedf6aa70cb5de06ca94cacd661e060c","50ff0a76657aff2a5cd76f6a36a14fd4fced3682","1323cba66c8d6c75be41bc7393345c25458e702c","65073d73d6949b56799539b1c7223cc2c06d47b1","01c9c6e4dfbfb425ffad502f1e3354c9385c3fa5","d20a2ac9dd305318b4bb8da98525ebd8856f29bc","a3f6ca0c5bbe7184efc69db1d44e5ddb70b84ba6","7f0d1ef77ab4f53438e9d7e1854785a1c0487752","ce191f7d42f5a9a48a88659b59468b2a1055cb76","4b1c2a213fae00b51bedc22a44b6ce8bed0840ce","00e7b5395198529e655170ab496d7151c7827339","58a6dadf8067431897cd689523285d7b89ebd841","caf2f5a4edfbbd35b92078aa151dbf1a08992d05","402e97b8eadaa5094814c4c81e721509f59dcfee"],"title":"A class of covariate-dependent spatiotemporal covariance functions.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS482"}
