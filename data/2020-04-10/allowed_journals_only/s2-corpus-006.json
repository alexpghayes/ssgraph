They live in diverse communities in which they interact synergistically or antagonistically. Thus for estimating microbial associations with clinical covariates, such as treatment effects, joint (multivariate) statistical models are preferred. Multivariate models allow one to estimate and exploit complex interdependencies among multiple taxa, yielding more powerful tests of exposure or treatment effects than application of taxon-specific univariate analyses. Analysis of microbial count data also requires special attention because data commonly exhibit zero inflation, i.e., more zeros than expected from a standard count distribution. To meet these needs, we developed a Bayesian variable selection model for multivariate count data with excess zeros that incorporates information on the covariance structure of the outcomes (counts for multiple taxa), while estimating associations with the mean levels of these outcomes. Though there has been much work on zero-inflated models for longitudinal data, little attention has been given to high-dimensional multivariate zero-inflated data modeled via a general correlation structure. Through simulation, we compared performance of the proposed method to that of existing univariate approaches, for both the binary (\"excess zero\") and count parts of the model. When outcomes were correlated the proposed variable selection method maintained type I error while boosting the ability to identify true associations in the binary component of the model. For the count part of the model, in some scenarios the univariate method had higher power than the multivariate approach. This higher power was at a cost of a highly inflated false discovery rate not observed with the proposed multivariate method. We applied the approach to oral microbiome data from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Oral Health Study and identified five (of 44) species associated with HIV infection.","inCitations":["118f41bd9ab7163c86bd7a1b2291cee1b41eb28e"],"title":"Bayesian variable selection for multivariate zero-inflated models: Application to microbiome count data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy067"}

The approach is designed for settings in which the instrument influences both the treatment of interest and a secondary treatment also influenced by the primary treatment. We demonstrate that, while instrumental variables methods may be used to estimate the joint effects of the primary and secondary treatments, they cannot by themselves be used to estimate the overall effect of the primary treatment. However, instrumental variables methods may be used in conjunction with approaches for estimating the effect of the primary on the secondary treatment to estimate the overall effect of the primary treatment. We consider extending the proposed methods to deal with confounding of the effect of the instrument, mediation of the effect of the instrument by other variables, failure-time outcomes, and time-varying secondary treatments.

In observational studies, the analysis of such data can be further complicated by left truncation. In this work, we study a varying co-efficient subdistribution regression model for left-truncated semi-competing risks data. Our method appropriately accounts for the specifical truncation and censoring features of the data, and moreover has the flexibility to accommodate potentially varying covariate effects. The proposed method can be easily implemented and the resulting estimators are shown to have nice asymptotic properties. We also present inference, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov type and Cramér Von-Mises type hypothesis testing procedures for the covariate effects. Simulation studies and an application to the Denmark diabetes registry demonstrate good finite-sample performance and practical utility of the proposed method.","inCitations":["0e75344f67b4ed21b70963ef9d4b90e0426db7db"],"title":"Varying coefficient subdistribution regression for left-truncated semi-competing risks data","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2014.06.005"}

We evaluate the performance of an MMRM-UN analysis using the Kenward-Roger method when the variance of outcome between treatment groups is unequal. In addition, we provide alternative approaches for valid inferences in the MMRM analysis framework. Two simulations are conducted in cases with (1) unequal variance but equal correlation between the treatment groups and (2) unequal variance and unequal correlation between the groups. Our results in the first simulation indicate that MMRM-UN analysis using the Kenward-Roger method based on a common covariance matrix for the groups yields notably poor coverage probability (CP) with confidence intervals for the treatment effect when both the variance and the sample size between the groups are disparate. In addition, even when the randomization ratio is 1:1, the CP will fall seriously below the nominal confidence level if a treatment group with a large dropout proportion has a larger variance. Mixed-effects models for repeated measures analysis with the Mancl and DeRouen covariance estimator shows relatively better performance than the traditional MMRM-UN analysis method. In the second simulation, the traditional MMRM-UN analysis leads to bias of the treatment effect and yields notably poor CP. Mixed-effects models for repeated measures analysis fitting separate UN covariance structures for each group provides an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect and an acceptable CP. We do not recommend MMRM-UN analysis using the Kenward-Roger method based on a common covariance matrix for treatment groups, although it is frequently seen in applications, when heteroscedasticity between the groups is apparent in incomplete longitudinal data.","inCitations":["3091d727487c82570128e89625f2ea90295ee26e"],"title":"Effect of heteroscedasticity between treatment groups on mixed-effects models for repeated measures.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1872"}

In practice, it is often the case that the second stage sample size is different from the planned one. For this reason, the critical value for the second stage is no longer valid for statistical inference. Existing approaches for making statistical inference are either based on asymptotic methods or not optimal. We propose an approach to maximize the power of the study while maintaining the type I error rate where the type I error rate and power are calculated exactly from binomial distributions. The critical values of the proposed approach are numerically searched by an intelligent algorithm over the complete parameter space. It is guaranteed that the proposed approach is at least as powerful as the conditional power approach which is a valid but non-optimal approach. The power gain of the proposed approach can be substantial as compared to the conditional power approach. We apply the proposed approach to a real Phase II clinical trial.","inCitations":["93fedfc3fd8e7006fcefb5cf58ca60b8a4a2fabd","75f44d31de429386c33ed5fb08049a5d08df0d79"],"title":"Optimal inference for Simon's two-stage design with over or under enrollment at the second stage","doi":"10.1080/03610918.2017.1307398"}

With such data collected under different stimulatory or inhibitory conditions, it is possible to infer the causal relationships among proteins from single cell interventional data. In this article we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework to infer the signaling pathway based on the posterior distributions of parameters in the model. Under this framework, we consider network sparsity and model the existence of an association between two proteins both at the overall level across all experiments and at each individual experimental level. This allows us to infer the pairs of proteins that are associated with each other and their causal relationships. We also explicitly consider both intrinsic noise and measurement error. Markov chain Monte Carlo is implemented for statistical inference. We demonstrate that this hierarchical modeling can effectively pool information from different interventional experiments through simulation studies and real data analysis.","inCitations":["4b50abdf9f33ed255f0e30a4c9aeb12f439311b9","b4f94880543a2afbef4401988f3fb0b9ee119f2b","ffb89d9829c4d12d29efe92e1802db2ea1e749b0","f51b47b3f8bdbed014db7134a247eab6acbeabd9","367669fd7ceae8dafb22ae37be7b8b0a6b8a1e55","f0dabc5324e0300e3b7adbfb4cba7c522ae501c8","8886203ca29c4260951d1275a1490bc4bb07d4af"],"title":"Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling for Signaling Pathway Inference from Single Cell Interventional Data.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS425"}

The methods to generate the intervals employ, respectively, the Cornish-Fisher expansion and the approximate bootstrap confidence (ABC), and the bootstrap-t and the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap (BC(a)). The former two are analytical and the latter two are numerical. Explicit expressions of the asymptotic bias and skewness of the communality estimators, used in the analytical methods, are derived. A Monte Carlo experiment reveals that the performance of central intervals based on normal approximations is a consequence of imbalance of miscoverage on the left- and right-hand sides. The second-order accurate intervals do not require symmetry around the point estimates of the usual intervals and achieve better balance, even when the sample size is not large. The behaviours of the second-order accurate intervals were similar to each other, particularly for large sample sizes, and no method performed consistently better than the others.","inCitations":["e355a22503882d9d4e96bc7273cdb7aa19c8812e","15ea8cfedf78dcee78aa56399575a8a354a759f8"],"title":"Constructing second-order accurate confidence intervals for communalities in factor analysis.","doi":"10.1348/000711007X204198"}

In addition, we derive the range of the tuning parameter for convex clustering that yields a non-trivial solution. We also provide an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom, and provide a finite sample bound for the prediction error for convex clustering. We compare convex clustering to some traditional clustering methods in simulation studies.","inCitations":["1423f0e567ae6d5dc89b4bc4d9da32502d121f1f","80d9f695fd3c8fe756cc7a78869e053077738e4e","2fd45b70847573dd1f858635b62a87cb122c1004","6dd61a23e2079e2f9720cdc025651e672c1acaaf","8f47e68d4e91907932015c389c2ce9c595eba60a","b27c163370540f9ff1aedf30b2ce1ca62e96eac1","fa2b540c9347ae522d72f6ce6747a43a288142b3","f630f1d8cec065262cd808cd4c3d6db15924c1a8","ca0acc054c95173c8709e90c02c85a3c55a874b9","fb447e5659ab2714c5273738739defa51e3a0676","419b4f55867c1a2c465faf8f9fe1b6153550f69d","ef6674c3f5a4bce38e1531ff3bfca32318221914","3b5b20fb72703d2301e268d6448b44d49738c9db","c98ee6aee15ca6ad970cf327014a61caa74763e8","686ec07a455b593c371bbffe580cb67136e7234a","68cf5c5ab431ed2ec96e4fcc45d1898966ebe2d5","cf999c7a58fac2915342daf795f98b9b1375a623","0c4d98fc096fde37e478574799a134643e7e844d","005e4b60d4a2ff4f55b072166ecc055edfc4bf6d","6993bc14c1f93abece82e57f88f68aaa54390320","01c4b1391f565aa083adab437080863c75576038","5c42b2a28120004a3476399fb2b75f83ab4f60e4","6ad7de8c35bb06074ef39acbd9967bd52961dc6a","73e90eb0ceb15441e761a2335e2cdffe3054c0af","86a1e6d24edce078a939b085f71c3ce689782882","a5ee2a4d4af54cf94c2e504694f9256f18858428","59f067e02007bd827603d57c190e453c3e4efc48"],"title":"Statistical properties of convex clustering.","doi":"10.1214/15-EJS1074"}

The main difficulty is that it is not reasonable to assume that a proportion with a background effect has a beta prior distribution. A generalized posterior distribution for proportions is derived in this paper. It includes the standard beta posterior distribution for a proportion without background effect as a special case. Bayesian inference and Bayesian sample size determination for proportions based on the generalized posterior distribution are discussed.","inCitations":["b768075d548054e4cf43eecc737cc8583e8a1381","db3bd628af4972a3aee03a9173d8238c40373f63"],"title":"Bayesian analysis for proportions with an independent background effect.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X86705"}

Gaussian graphical models have been suggested to provide an effective method for constructing such genetic networks. However, most of the available methods for constructing Gaussian graphs do not account for the sparsity of the networks and are computationally more demanding or infeasible, especially in the settings of high dimension and low sample size. We introduce a threshold gradient descent (TGD) regularization procedure for estimating the sparse precision matrix in the setting of Gaussian graphical models and demonstrate its application to identifying genetic networks. Such a procedure is computationally feasible and can easily incorporate prior biological knowledge about the network structure. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method yields a better estimate of the precision matrix than the procedures that fail to account for the sparsity of the graphs. We also present the results on inference of a gene network for isoprenoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. These results demonstrate that the proposed procedure can indeed identify biologically meaningful genetic networks based on microarray gene expression data.","inCitations":["98f433d0cfc437fb3046e84958a65e5fe1409dfb","9e38550005bdb8048f9f523565ebf85e709f0175","a246cb35ef5cd3cbcf63df30d4b5fa635999f63d","c4da514b995a4bea6bd0ee1e3cdb7aa45a59b7d9","b71204da88e2ffb7efc5da74501f36ca7e836f9e","1a6f0c6f52ad0fc2be86235fcc276ec7f50fce4f","a3446b2ca3f1a4d12cfe9eff5f024ca99b9f4fa8","4146d18028a7dc7ee525e1828b311042f40e7543","faf251d6f3fa27716503327fb12a4e8ba3bc5d20","90b1d796190b2558f38970a954e4e6c999944c5f","ffc2aaac70554a4f9ba6d56bf7e1c69c65e6b38c","97fe0d793738763da9214de309c3c4ceb829ba41","8311e74a2dc7ba0ff85c60898840309989ccc708","89f085f6f00ba7aec82329ae6b10c503743978ee","5c5867526a840fbddbe17e3808e6efe0aa03affa","ba6cc3dc580e01c9842c84076a3a634105d97bb0","716231ad7463d8c2d6052628e5a13283043b2c74","ea9724f61d8dcd4d63d80033d1a1867440332ab8","bbbfcaf0130f0d2b40d317b2258121bfc86fcee6","620f4734e646c594702dcf9c0ef6b65cb704c2d7","73694794fed5f68ccfdaeda76a00eca4dea230ea","199a9edf870aafcd4f09d65f5f9aa467c5c96c43","575d43c650a9e90484b0e61be620a104305c5731","cd4f3957557ad06a56bd5dd61af4aac01c15ceea","8ddd7dfad1a37f971a85736ecab0a9371d59f3a6","349b680f2d441811ae3e44a2b00a10ef3923b559","e2bd86c261e787ba610b3357cbbfb8486df48684","3f4558a664773ae7b05245f7860bf20b863e5b1d","010ec2f8c3a39915d9b1a978936eb2f3364aadb5","7c57d5fd17f89953da1474f0905a17ad620272b8","ef5d4979a2234857084099bf3894901c331c330f","8517b531f45b9b475e6c2e1a8a42e229d683b66c","b7849493d1dac4e77718aa736b756165121503c0","288645f0577d3df93625ce137dcb25de7f2be3e3","3531687122d47cbc5f9294aa8a0ff55122bfe10c","8ac362539c327a436387eb97e076448a11a1b208","658aaf35d0e25d83e57a343f49ab12fc6884affe","5a607f6990bdf37fa2623be43ede7fd55b5bed79","8d4ebefc1d0f7738a7c0db26a88eb4ea66ae45bd","c1a4f4047fcc145e4ba307d1e472c3f6a1894d83","ad1f3e8ef320d67cab7dd7fc198b684c3a3737f6","fe043dae27b1d8cc92c6e5afd24e28a55e5e2838","481c9840e0c1898c595fc67a9d017a21820e56da","d1117356655c088d081cdf276e938f1ffc29987b","b4defdf53fd21cb949dd53c325ddee91317ac0ca","ed612d3951d8044da31c1d4dba66e44b74bd2fd7","73cfe120a3819a2c908675ed8d9e74a9eaf421c9","1e991cc2460230946bddcdd8b9afdbcde6d48c6d","02196ac722bc0ef8841d7c179e3b5fd40eefe647","a582202229003019b19067578eb63cb8b070fade","8a1d1c82cb09dfd69f1e6ff92d067fd6556e6549","3939ee54cfd8640ab7b3bcd6afb17cc48367b166","666ecd7c53967418ab5c1eed7262df1108571f37","6bb0bb7255a665f821637860d80f36f975b488ee","b36cf46d03b4bbf516bc83ff059d1f06b0e74480","5fdcddd16781741f18ccaca97383dccda4370f27","0814e577132f39ed991a2c2060b7d9ba69b8bfcc","757499976c5900e6e9ab0e8cfad5de62b68b4273","89a42bb79634280d531b4d77e8c7bd700cf53e1e","1d45e75438c57098bebe8c868111d685812f155e","9ee0b6db025fabc5ed568beb8ee1232dd66496f9","664cca6e63bf1eff055d525adbb39839a48d9b1c","1046c2b928ae6363995d92a7983c2f02a7dbc123","0b78eaf179167144ab5c4c1f6f5019253c4d8eb4","7830cd5f364b3b1a29517797905fbce35f7c8d78","663df0a48ec8acc27247c271861bc916590c2c9c","97d9aa918c004ea5568571c7c1411135e2c2418e","6cf6580f0459bc6e341567e37ebc6ed273f7f60d","fc8b5b526b3e96897921b54ee27ec3a9d296ca04","2859423c9132721969496da5acc9871884454970","176230da96e91833675eb7f235ae81181aadb56c","d907395579611514ae1734a5b67547a60b672c01","83e84c20fe44d4ed62dc34d420edf7bcc4a102cc","669ecc774cc7750498d31f7c51f954dd342546f4","06a1e0890723cc7a2c29dced121491dce4ed491a","1f44de1b2eb232a579507e02b050cb01cf794c3a","0bfc2dc613be06f629918e53fce8407d58e825a0","3ba453570fcfe6979c9ab618a07e1c2c3ccb654d","49d837eade948db5e4dd83a31afc9259cb1f67a6","7cdc5273270b1a9c68a14cd02177ea7a00f3a66a","8c050fe179f709922e7becfe7af435c2ef31eed8","323388857361cfa928028fc5ae4cb0efebd9d0d2","2b1e7ef69cf6319cf98be8bdd401f52413b736f8","91e793ee258033d24be2948af150df60a9565ca6","20ac1c8eb61855750b7ff1f786028cbdc87404ce","022b1e4a13eb93f7fd49ee739d66d4012f4ec7df","0d4e2c9ef9f3ec1d84a611f5d5a9b5e527fa5058","dc758bcee8cd75e8f9eec9eee24e9449df4eb34e","3c949e50eef81164ae5615e5e432f4a0377ab82e","0ae928f2effc9314225b6b8bd9e929b7ef8cb1d3","5481757cb935ebb72f8418770220e38438d19413","40bcf2c5c6b1634fc3ca56cbe812955fc1404979","f1d30c79ecb973ee7891bd1ff1c56894923b2ec6","fe952e156775eae98375a0f668c58e85ed60dbea","d3d994239079b353e69e8de8b70ff762cc57a92a","230b74625ed74e81e605b3686374a9299f18661c","51b0d67789a05eee41e2d31e12dca2048e54c5d7","5c3a023d779377b0a0496f7c0ebaa461c2feabc9","74bfe67c30a6bbe3b653c1735b32490f3fd48b4f","0bbc97994a1af69de1e784bfe54f0a86e1b6a852","2dd79411c60061f484bbd251db6f2ecd24c0236f","07f5c8285c1f67b8a4ac88a43d4a96e40a9f4dd1","f0ba995d3396358446f05556a4dbd7ed7e7a58da","7b521fb3a55b2ea6c4337550dc53ed110923f9b7","8a96e0aae4fcf8c1495c8adbab5dbd81bb2252f0","e7b4d79130a264665efeb0cad81052893d0a4db9","c8590a17fb3badfaf6691683b677796914ca61dd","5006e66095e3a42634e5ee4de59f10220c204778","b76902197361e461945f4ac805b93c7211de5534","94c65c65f32abe9947aa0ee8597e15c63bfbad0c","f2045761798a5a672fc993462ff510cca20583c6","12da60a227fc2f4dc90b6240fc8837c7eba42a1a","d7e57e72321390d8c09042ee35f909547889fb40","142512f37445170328958f2de7e0d9ebf70cb738","31c88a88c9603ec32b237128dec6feeb5713a5d5","f985eeee9695773ac649dc01b47d5d06

An optimized version of the pointwise CI with the shortest width is developed. A new ellipse-envelope simultaneous CB for the ROC curve is suggested as an adaptation of the Working-Hotelling-type CB implemented in a paper by Ma and Hall (1993). Statistical simulations show that our ellipse-envelope CB covers the true ROC curve with a probability close to nominal while the coverage probability of the Ma and Hall CB is significantly smaller.

In this paper, we study a class of regression models, which directly relates the RMET to its \"baseline\" covariates for predicting the future subjects' RMETs. Since the standard Cox and the accelerated failure time models can also be used for estimating such RMETs, we utilize a cross-validation procedure to select the \"best\" among all the working models considered in the model building and evaluation process. Lastly, we draw inferences for the predicted RMETs to assess the performance of the final selected model using an independent data set or a \"hold-out\" sample from the original data set.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2011,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of statistical planning and inference","paperAbstract":"Open label and single blinded randomized controlled clinical trials are vulnerable to selection bias when the next treatment assignment is predictable based on the randomization algorithm and the preceding assignment history. While treatment predictability is an issue for all constrained randomization algorithms, deterministic assignments are unique to permuted block randomization. Deterministic assignments may lead to treatment predictability with certainty and selection bias, which could inflate the type I error and hurts the validity of trial results. It is important to accurately evaluate the probability of deterministic assignments in permuted block randomization, so proper protection measures can be implemented. For trials with number of treatment arms T = 2 and a balance block size B = 2m, Matts and Lachin indicated that the probability of deterministic assignment is 1m+1. For more general situations, with T ≥ 2 and a block size B=∑j=1Tmj, Dupin-Spriet provided a formula, which can be written as 1B∑j=1T∑i=1mj∏k=1imj-k+1B-k+1. This formula involves extensive calculation in evaluation. In this paper, we simplified this formula to 1B∑j=1TmjB-mj+1 for general scenarios and 1B-m+1 for trials with a balanced allocation. Through mathematical induction we show the equivalence of the formulas. While the new formula is numerically equivalent to Dupin-Spriet's formula, the simple format not only is easier for evaluation, but also is clearer in describing the impact of parameters T and m(i) on the probability of deterministic assignments.","inCitations":["ac6c2bfa362cff42347bb1b48b3a404141693a52"],"title":"A simplified formula for quantification of the probability of deterministic assignments in permuted block randomization.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2010.06.023"}

With high-dimensional data, the ROC techniques are needed to conduct classification and variable selection. The current ROC methods do not explicitly incorporate unequal misclassification costs or do not have a theoretical grounding for optimizing the AUC. Empirical studies in the literature have demonstrated that optimizing the hinge loss can maximize the AUC approximately. In theory, minimizing the hinge rank loss is equivalent to minimizing the AUC in the asymptotic limit. In this article, we propose a novel nonparametric method HingeBoost to optimize a weighted hinge loss incorporating misclassification costs. HingeBoost can be used to construct linear and nonlinear classifiers. The estimation and variable selection for the hinge loss are addressed by a new boosting algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed twin HingeBoost can select more sparse predictors. Some properties of HingeBoost are studied as well. To compare HingeBoost with existing classification methods, we present empirical study results using data from simulations and a prostate cancer study with mass spectrometry-based proteomics.","inCitations":["90b921ccea427752eabc0bcd6fbca9388f252a7f","3b7a95605eb97be19a3f269f8d807ab4e15458a5","af0fdb1d5da8184d2dea28542d1b9ca858f6e532","7a3f1902b5e71c4f974fbe800498f5a6b7f645e5","5b44ee1492678c8d1f48807cdc16d85a2dd4d9e4","72150d9b765e3936173a49f37d1520aac9b72bec","b0df9ddd8d99206e6431a25aebcc177c16f72e41","4e261b65ac51ebfb83906aecad871fee3dc596e7","52ac9ae9138ee18292728f91290b9f0793f3dc98","d48c5252e0af7e1edeb7524cf11b1f8e283e7d1b"],"title":"HingeBoost: ROC-Based Boost for Classification and Variable Selection","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1304"}

An adjusted relative risk can be estimated using log binomial regression; however, convergence problems are common with this model. While alternative methods have been proposed for estimating relative risks, comparisons between methods have been limited, particularly in the context of RCTs. We compare ten different methods for estimating relative risks under a variety of scenarios relevant to RCTs with independent observations. Results of a large simulation study show that some methods may fail to overcome the convergence problems of log binomial regression, while others may substantially overestimate the treatment effect or produce inaccurate confidence intervals. Further, conclusions about the effectiveness of treatment may differ depending on the method used. We give recommendations for choosing a method for estimating relative risks in the context of RCTs with independent observations.","inCitations":["82928f646126cb9ba343fecbd3b465945f740ef0","d187713e3c24a09b37fceabc201390f0c5f54a74","ced7db464708d205a23fe62ba15c119a5183675d","0ba57290fac4b73bdd0b8332a65011b993ca29c0","99d72846648d3c6b66f2ee50a503eab0898b4633","3ad5f428230b669b1968fff4f6be7bc937147069","e6ca24f2b7280fde853a4439005b2195f0b983e6","4c6227606125b841859bfda480c8df6ac1ea9fc6","784d0f7465831ec640ffc51e9ac212b176b97526","ce386792d858e8318b7f8747667259ff40dd2fcb","e942a91e913aa90088805c0d1173e1e41c5cede0","255277930b327cf97ac652d51f227b422c3b01b2","5ecc045b654c166f4aa2472e1e20cc7cc19a4f64","c0c3ceab0ba4c5a2a91b4f12addd30d8cb42f811","f29af198dc8d8596607f2c1dafd4b9d5c59e45fc","06f782c0b957b94c84e0df5c760f4973957a9f7a","a6f2dbb290dd048a4f38ab2dbcccbb09b31a210b","b41367b7710970f5cb48380e8c0080b074cf9b6e","c58827d545b341190873c16c6ecaec7323670bed","5ca19454eb2954d01f4243f81483294ab82c063d","88c3d8df7803aafc61fe55bffb09d6250cac4c89","bdd5c90144a6cbb8de9562ee7591ff08be20e88b"],"title":"Relative Risk Estimation in Randomized Controlled Trials: A Comparison of Methods for Independent Observations","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1278"}

According to this model, the perfect match and mismatch values are assumed to be correlated as a result of sharing a common gene expression signal. Rather than a Bayesian approach, we develop a maximum likelihood algorithm for estimating the underlying common signal. In this way, estimation is explicit and much faster than the BGX implementation. The observed Fisher information matrix, rather than a posterior credibility interval, gives an idea of the accuracy of the estimators. We evaluate our method using benchmark spike-in data sets from Affymetrix and GeneLogic by analyzing the relationship between estimated signal and concentration, i.e. true signal, and compare our results with other commonly used methods.","inCitations":["4d4142ea54fdb3f914c02ebbc2f775795208251f","05492fa9a38f64587c3a734544832696b30e9d2e","992330a7acd5da1523c5bb66c0f381f05863e744","081644473ac397bbea3afed86468450dc6b133a3","2eb9f75655f1f73f044119dd88ace4e3e7bcf488"],"title":"FGX: a frequentist gene expression index for Affymetrix arrays.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl020"}

These four methods have similar power in detecting the average linear slope across time. MCMC and Laplace estimates perform relatively better on the bias of the average linear slope and corresponding standard error, as well as the item location parameters. For the variance of the random intercept, and the covariance between the random intercept and slope, all estimates are biased in most conditions. For the random slope variance, only Laplace estimates are unbiased when there are eight time points.","inCitations":["7f7f012c02d54104c273723950bb7afbfcf508d0","8f48e259e1ddd6b127c6c4230f1c87873f2f5bf8"],"title":"Latent growth curve analysis with dichotomous items: Comparing four approaches.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12058"}
