A generalized estimating equation approach is developed with two sets of equations. The first set models the marginal distribution of categorical ratings, and the second set models the pairwise association of ratings with the kappa coefficient (kappa) as a metric. Covariates can be incorporated into both sets of equations. This approach is compared with a latent variable model that assumes an underlying multivariate normal distribution in which the intraclass correlation coefficient is used as a measure of association. Examples are from a cervical ectopy study and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Veteran Twin Study.","inCitations":["dda51787959f7f9fe42710d6e85a92c2825448e1","828da838f82b97426c142b155ebd8358613d6c5a","4e5dc377728488f757878a6bf63886c8ef81a916","2ca899b318353ef18edbb06185cd7627c13c22c8","77974ed9a814bb6f647ea10b1d74fde3bc061016","15be9f7f84118b4f024cdcd165c14c856b62b733","55f92509f98947bf5cc268eca7f1c664a8a06f4d","e30ea49ad2f8244949d48024b801f9119b250d43","219c5221e8aa1b3199dbbeceac542383c018748e","bb2c00496c52a8788c67a202080ace1e755763a5","2c47716370d6a6cfa6e121dcac3273814e98dc2a","5b578ad0548028aaddd6b18d426e1859ac936830","b8640651d53b5e4d29793641ef4b202049e859be","473dbf7f3941ec53779bf3de5c29ff213255f908","0755471d1245128a78798a22704edd8f5eb480b0","a300174220f8e999ccc1989261f818ad04542458","c4e72a0e0b668b0eeb7e05be6919c2c7148b4916","77c7a7880b2e105b201bb29debcb06f8e993e96b","b22207579a94d558ed51b5379f3b885ed3ed752d","73a9a5c6e1330bb5007ee3a3be36604c2755b1b8","d56613c2b7e78d09c803e4cf75aae9ff4996d025","c3e431fcc175b3cfafe4f2e4a2e6c7f9cf82e86b","9323427f50cce4ff782bbfa68cee26f1ff0e821c","10f3650b32cc05386c16f827ba0ffbb3f2cb15f9","9dc11a3e2529fdc01cfa0239ae7b9e899cae55d4","a60a5fa946e2fd9234663a2db249eec45e765039","d8935b70c528b569ea231b327624b39ec23da461","2f87c254bd9628ef53479f9a9f8a9b877ee5e056","d74a28471630f1141e7f82e1f4f7b4b328521fd2","341fdd1f2ed7d41907ad4387f6c7a4a6f43e5b8f","179cdf488822a8d70b2326886db03c6606103c04","f661af7085292cec465176bbee47d1626428d01f","4841be620133b9a25471ab55ee2aa993a7b820cf"],"title":"Modeling kappa for measuring dependent categorical agreement data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.2.191"}

When in a design stage, it is possible that there is a high degree of uncertainty on variability of the formulations and the actual performance of the test versus reference formulation. Therefore, an interim look may be desirable to stop the study if there is no chance of claiming BE at the end (futility), or claim BE if evidence is sufficient (efficacy), or adjust the sample size. Sequential design approaches specially for BE studies have been proposed previously in publications. We applied modification to the existing methods focusing on simplified multiplicity adjustment and futility stopping. We name our method modified sequential design for BE studies (MSDBE).

A commonly used design oversamples families enriched with the disease under study for efficient data collection and estimation. For instance, in a multiple cases family study, families are selected based on the number of affected relatives. In such cases, valid inference for the model parameters relies on the proper modeling of both the within family correlations and the outcome-dependent sampling, also known as ascertainment. A flexible modeling approach is the ascertainment-corrected mixed-effects model, but it is known to only be asymptotically identifiable, because in small samples the available data do not provide sufficient information to estimate both the intercept and the genetic variance. To deal with this issue, we propose a penalized maximum likelihood estimation procedure which reliably estimates the model parameters in small family studies by using external population-based information.","inCitations":["0c48a94b471ae6442087ec7f6633056a4363c617","041f06b92204d43c9e1b12e90b33472fcb889a0c","f668383783eb041c1444f19fbc89e7d3cd42229c","2e96863fcb4a0c60bef482d0cca6301bc5bef9a6"],"title":"Estimation of genetic effects in multiple cases family studies using penalized maximum likelihood methodology.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs032"}

It may strongly influence the final outcome of an average bioequivalence study. Testing a null hypothesis of zero carryover is useless: not rejecting it does not guarantee the non-existence of carryover, and rejecting it is not informative of the true degree of carryover and its influence on the validity of the final outcome of the bioequivalence study. We propose a more consistent approach: even if some carryover is present, is it enough to seriously distort the study conclusions or is it negligible? This is the central aim of this paper, which focuses on average bioequivalence studies based on 2 Ã 2 crossover designs and on the main problem associated with carryover: type I error inflation. We propose an equivalence testing approach to these questions and suggest reasonable negligibility or relevance limits for carryover. Finally, we illustrate this approach on some real datasets.","inCitations":["96ca3c3f9c53f0800eead3ff3657724c0df1519b","6436556507ddbe5f7ef796d13525c2033c02117e"],"title":"Carryover negligibility and relevance in bioequivalence studies.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1699"}

Since plasma HIV RNA copies (viral load) and CD4+ cell counts are crucial virologic and immunologic markers for HIV infection, it is important to study their relationship during HIV/AIDS treatment. We propose a mixed-effects varying-coefficient model based on an exploratory analysis of data from a clinical trial. Since both viral load and CD4+ cell counts are subject to measurement error, we also consider the measurement error problem in covariates in our model. The regression spline method is proposed for inference for parameters in the proposed model. The regression spline method transforms the unknown nonparametric components into parametric functions. It is relatively simple to implement using readily available software, and parameter inference can be developed from standard parametric models. We apply the proposed models and methods to an AIDS clinical study. From this study, we find an interesting relationship between viral load and CD4+ cell counts during antiviral treatments. Biological interpretations and clinical implications are discussed.","inCitations":["3a0767897f9d83931ca65984d778cad4154d90ae","fac7839e5117ad5c5375350ba646c38cb02056e0","d1c7af4c0a678b407dedc8162afc2498c98ee990","209a6bec13b33ac2b091d1ac61dbfad0eb2c0f37","9a2cafa106a207c49c833bfccd32e2491e49fb79","0bd293928568659ce0ddf570060edba7e6076ea8","2641f1243ddf6efd07402368b7f2024284bcf490","35d53463220ff98ae00a187a2430dbbf374fa03d","0ec782cec7cbee7d4d30685e33b226ee446b6b3d","37d65d884e3b96b981f35c57df5569ce8e716bbe","b78f61233626868f7a90e7852c9b799269ceec91","3819b56cf7d808d31071f28fdbe81a3cc2d130f6","70aa01b578b5e6e4029d46f5d451362c66e88301","c4a404eb202be07d3f5ca7ef544686ee2d831f35","19744923c09461226223c6b156b7a37ba818f926","a3948756cfeaa4a8c417ffa7e0b7c1210307d683","c1a7378f2597b2cde91cc65a6d41a76829f41cf9","7e9a55fb768fdc210b32de87b4d2813cafba59c9","012d057f4054e81bba610ea2a03527745321e377","c861b0b5b82d9a51f8b14d46e388d8a10678d8b5","03c8b677da22efd3e5e9614be3dd71d392c14cf2","52becd745e63e624b1638c39ff40cb5bbacb2c36","a5f6c4a223703406c28b4d81d76bc50d0b2caf8b","872aa166e975bcb678db099ae71455b8723a94c4","fb9acdb3658a543b1dc2ea3ede0b87cc12bf02b0","e94e3bbc61bea17ef73285930585c2e007aea79a","e189be782cdc8bbaa5197e99a7dc7ad5365e9154","f0398ee154c41e27ee8dcace5f502817a740780a","d20116a4f03be63a449590c74f65ff258e3ab161","4cc9777a857ab92f2e9c57f1917c0c42a15eb902","0bcdbdb80e3d4e445a13744030d1d088b5bff8f4","c587ac7305e069b87d855a140aa1c1dfbf934f97","f2b61430473d84fc26e87e8528d287dd0408a276","c6d2186b1c3604b8f0b3fc239610916ced7290f5","c58de3ba54a149de649cfacc6f8833858884b2f9","7b4d8aa4be2471d9948cb0e436ab1620fa261312","002414eb633334710d351ce4f73726b67866315d","bf0f27ebd0e491e9ecbcff37bb5be13256041be9","46e6d0634ac31a58764ba5ebcc856007a3375538","7796c256db0f8573d7cc0cdbbd9ea05a33ec0d6f","ac6ceeb9689d8dac9c9d51709b5fcd531f362c3b","e165ab95c1fcf05871fe135bdd1a694bb346ffc9","d35e4fd7114280585397b90a03683a71ad4ddd32","edb86fe07ae42df2ef86cb2119388d70c6d8673b","b6055202bcb17df4db5430d7f0869060fbc0db81","6e7050e0d642ebe152c11839f73375629b14afe3","45ae072424c579e84bc5428a18705cebaf9b62d5","4bb994610035532be47fa71e1c48be21e05461f9","41205d6f3eccb969782d0373caa92f8e5af890c1","96b2b3ba5509624377cd0bf3522c234041ea0147","84564f03addabb57848cc5289f526ee0da956542","6648fafb48c3dd682e9bd7c501fc0682ab927279","81a1722919dbef26b4661595486d30f659768cd7"],"title":"The relationship between virologic and immunologic responses in AIDS clinical research using mixed-effects varying-coefficient models with measurement error.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.297"}

The approach we take differs from other available approaches in two fundamental aspects. Firstly, we aim to integrate all processing steps of the raw data in a common statistically coherent framework, allowing all components and thus associated errors to be considered simultaneously. Secondly, inference is based on the full posterior distribution of gene expression indices and derived quantities, such as fold changes or ranks, rather than on single point estimates. Measures of uncertainty on these quantities are thus available. The models presented represent the first building block for integrated Bayesian Analysis of Affymetrix GeneChip data: the models take into account additive as well as multiplicative error, gene expression levels are estimated using perfect match and a fraction of mismatch probes and are modeled on the log scale. Background correction is incorporated by modeling true signal and cross-hybridization explicitly, and a need for further normalization is considerably reduced by allowing for array-specific distributions of nonspecific hybridization. When replicate arrays are available for a condition, posterior distributions of condition-specific gene expression indices are estimated directly, by a simultaneous consideration of replicate probe sets, avoiding averaging over estimates obtained from individual replicate arrays. The performance of the Bayesian model is compared to that of standard available point estimate methods on subsets of the well known GeneLogic and Affymetrix spike-in data. The Bayesian model is found to perform well and the integrated procedure presented appears to hold considerable promise for further development.","inCitations":["69f5988ed890a0f75d1904256b43f8c13a23897b","e48422b461d4cdbdd7af3c43e92decc6d0f2f252","9d095468b16a465647262aaae5f1eb240a97b267","a593b85e4ee87d504ec740000e6bcf87357a8e3d","27d19eb80e824128c281f818046f601ea9b59056","a2fc6062e294a09244f28f56ac563b966836b6e6","551ceacfa51d6a59f0a12c40d0272d115fd2ad10","70ad632cfa166f45ab7e06d586d3571492cc185e","c7aeacd149bd29a83f82d3970df521f7be5baef5","37c3306d534bae348487807a1ddbca13f307976b","fb7f564f6e0db3c2740be49e56bbec3831df1c78","210541a4a37a1bbb5c27a372ba40555d646d0bf8","e320ca1502dae6fde015a1dd8f2ca0f208252bc0","b693390124c3ed33350367ea7f55eeebba365b6f","3618b0b506f6cee49157a67d5cd8bf288daccbb2","9e727bfa7ef2a5f2aa52266f946944628304dd83","a96dacf4940e6863388f467b173a66e3eead7e6a","77d08be2b190a3fdd2738fc8a4b4dcc38b64b16a","6b651c37f2f02e096aa67f35bd547a2c2990ac33","a790c9b0ea0872813b53b01b4395cb2c1e188b3a","f5f370b18041944ba0f80ddbf575987a18ce2208","bdfdf6e51b6f7470f10117978c2fc43d4ee60143","b5d58f77b32c5752ebe893830aebd67d62d35fee","8700927b89afd0e548eae5d806cc7977ca6f5b28","ea9feb65511dbaa9e10194cd01d9dfbcbfe1dc05","e5f9816bcc717bb076ad6d8f6aaabb8a59155eed","6907984b5d5b84b1e07abb1a01655cee14a0a151","55f35ac7b64aaf9bc39edf0b84680379da203987","c2d8830db5598106baff22b1214dde301b4560fd","f865ddf85bcf032512b91f7b6eb210125400d202","2eb9f75655f1f73f044119dd88ace4e3e7bcf488","e715c5cb0f0b89bb1936440fa7b50e8f015a0fca","607c2eddefb7cae4555fe107e95b34966b25a170","b2f12794bc0e68d2d217fdd9940368e47e1a6b84"],"title":"BGX: a fully Bayesian integrated approach to the analysis of Affymetrix GeneChip data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi016"}

Despite many papers on propensity score analysis, few have focused on the analysis of survival data. Even within the framework of the popular proportional hazard model, the choice among marginal, stratified or adjusted models remains unclear. A Monte Carlo simulation study was used to compare the performance of several survival models to estimate both marginal and conditional treatment effects. The impact of accounting or not for pairing when analysing propensity-score-matched survival data was assessed. In addition, the influence of unmeasured confounders was investigated. After matching on the propensity score, both marginal and conditional treatment effects could be reliably estimated. Ignoring the paired structure of the data led to an increased test size due to an overestimated variance of the treatment effect. Among the various survival models considered, stratified models systematically showed poorer performance. Omitting a covariate in the propensity score model led to a biased estimation of treatment effect, but replacement of the unmeasured confounder by a correlated one allowed a marked decrease in this bias. Our study showed that propensity scores applied to survival data can lead to unbiased estimation of both marginal and conditional treatment effect, when marginal and adjusted Cox models are used. In all cases, it is necessary to account for pairing when analysing propensity-score-matched data, using a robust estimator of the variance.","inCitations":["2dffd899cada092b8d712f3e1fd1dba9774fccbd","f63f4a10184450d8108e4b8569dfa644ccfad6fd","5ec4052fee69aea7941e7daffc7e27898d5c07c3","1097baf62582b99a86a2b4cf35a6c14cb5db44e6","81c90010bfd0fcb5bb9a5fcac5341d4327440aa8","3287b3fbf437e46e55698ac20f6525fa5d7e6141","01b8cd631e58a1aa40ceb32758f3050076b3a052","bd75090aa6c6d59ef31ae6c07bafdfb28ab1ec5c","dcc67da66f36dd7a56cf8afa9d49b0ebb6d4fab4","64db41aee97a82cdedc0e4cb0afd11e792ac2735","9127dd1f5c0879947d523ca1ce583702132071ab","3da6a738d6bcead1b3bae0c8bac72e720f9cedb4","7a8b80815719795600d94c9ab3b73ed447c5d413","04e619542fba2ad6557b126d80c5e156484c93b7","5afb40fc76a0b2eb925f3a02fb7d0d75d840a846","05d6df05c5d5759d8874ab5a107e313b2a69fbbd","7a804149016e5c8eafcb3cd6382e4a526559e498","1b8968fdcf92ca6e163657103ff636ce89f5508f","a2a98d6fed6fa8e679185f1cdabd846c7d18980e","8511960a2ddf3b4199f56c7f12933a85f4d11824","32945edbe1288b7c6503c228c9ab5d181dfd61aa","18e61f9e0bb9b73e24ea649a8b9e639ca908a968","09e595f1f8fbe5f93f6d4d7c1430828b0ccc326f","e85ba166b00df1e8109b9fed48d89af6cb9eb8e3","f3393736f707477c8fa746a5bbbf5172319587f3","db8844da2770a86acdacff48b29da096ab494e7f","77e6763a39c61ea980c460dd758cb8f0cd9cf9af","7e1a35188c6b3cf95171142c8644644f3e1ca327","af4930dd362a9c4c08eea4318be1228005b32bcc","692936b01aa9a35f76fccf8253f3c54f2c2c4efa","64ecdfe826a98e12fbf304795a36d21b01c5ddb2","afbd2ad680887ea5480e60bfd84fa6fb90b23f60","be80b328a00c8a7b7d616c3b48c4355128432947","13313ab0a0c00cef07bfa366b03d91b4ed4ccb23","a37737e19e488db46c9eb6608bc9dd8e5e52e6c1","52da5fb7f56a2970b75bbcd4e86e4614e6ebd574","325d221efe3e8b736379ef1cba84d20f6ff26eb9","e0670400ef0446d3f513f291a04d596bc5c9d60c","b0a888516bbdc6d1794cba30d3f84a8b3e182651","f1bf96de9bd9a2cb585ee05bc3c8aebfe1a8f72e","831259d19c81d4c48e6507cb19eaf5c70198ada0","306ff0b53c9ac8d87fb8fb092feeaebded7890f7","67df53433d044270500ae650f2726f24dd3c4dce","48c1b7d94c0cfdb03c4d238d21ee515aeaf81a9b","a7d38c33818e3c75e004fa315438d835277cfa93","40b1293d92b90c04e33892f38c682af4ecbcfa49","a919c7af73627a8676e0e117d08541ca391dc731","cc78a77517c3df4f0f100ef1a2b3980257892c17","f2b75305bc1077444b9e1b413cb983da2b8c81a8","ce91bab1a970449a3cd43b4de2bc42b043b18dc6","295136b1ce29e2e1b1af5b5597cd56a409af1fb7"],"title":"Propensity score applied to survival data analysis through proportional hazards models: a Monte Carlo study.","doi":"10.1002/pst.537"}

Graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) are often used since the underlying assumptions are well understood, the graph is readily estimated by calculating the partial correlation (paCor) matrix, and its interpretation is straightforward. In spite of these advantages, GGMs are limited in that interactions are not accommodated as the underlying multivariate normality assumption allows for linear dependencies only. As we show, when applied in the presence of interactions, the GGM framework can lead to incorrect inference regarding dependence. Identifying the exact dependence structure in this context is a difficult problem, largely because an analogue of the paCor matrix is not available and dependencies can involve many nodes. We here present a computationally efficient approach to identify bivariate interactions in networks. A key element is recognizing that interactions have a marginal linear effect and as a result information about their presence can be obtained from the paCor matrix. Theoretical derivations for the exact effect are presented and used to motivate the approach; and simulations suggest that the method works well, even in fairly complicated scenarios. Practical advantages are demonstrated in analyses of data from a breast cancer study.","inCitations":["4ae0fcd2de115990418d4f8fbf6c1560ff3209b9","c4da514b995a4bea6bd0ee1e3cdb7aa45a59b7d9","73b4f6acafe3b09384ad7ff642aa7e1c8c8bf1e1","63dd331d6d5fa03cd44e186af77906bad4e28bb4","69535ef44322fb1fcdd84e73667b4b93763d89da","8a96e0aae4fcf8c1495c8adbab5dbd81bb2252f0","6be10801fe3f38e1190d2fce1c4e60edc4882474","4ebb0164803f779ae7d5f151e3b7d23c3f318f40","b447ccce330d2f7865d3b2e6f69e026cf24b9df3","b1739466efe72413ac55dc1cc10cd0424383524d"],"title":"An efficient method for identifying statistical interactors in gene association networks.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp025"}

Because the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) has been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer bone metastases, it is of great interest to examine possible relationships between PDGFR inhibition and therapeutic outcomes. Here, we analyze the association between change in activated PDGFR (p-PDGFR) and progression free survival (PFS) time based on large within-patient samples of cell-specific p-PDGFR values taken before and after treatment from each of 88 prostate cancer patients. To utilize these paired samples as covariate data in a regression model for PFS time, and because the p-PDGFR distributions are bimodal, we first employ a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model to obtain a deconvolution of the pre-treatment and post-treatment within-patient p-PDGFR distributions. We evaluate fits of the mixture model and a non-mixture model that ignores the bimodality by using a supnorm metric to compare the empirical distribution of each p-PDGFR data set with the corresponding fitted distribution under each model. Our results show that first using the mixture model to account for the bimodality of the within-patient p-PDGFR distributions, and then using the posterior within-patient component mean changes in p-PDGFR so obtained as covariates in the regression model for PFS time provides an improved estimation.","inCitations":["de2ff6d11723dacc78a78e0ece4962f79c51ded4","387a8fb7d07d6f0d1e8d9c7e67432659505e907e","e98d8011093741e3941bbb78a2a5808dd4711351","4791a84ff1f877dab06d9ccb55e225762c769438"],"title":"A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for platelet derived growth factor receptor phosphorylation to improve estimation of progression-free survival in prostate cancer.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2009.00680.x"}
