Probabilistic classifiers have received relatively little attention for small n large p classification problems despite of their importance in medical decision making. In this paper, we introduce 2 criteria for assessment of probabilistic classifiers: well-calibratedness and refinement and develop corresponding evaluation measures. We evaluated several published high-dimensional probabilistic classifiers and developed 2 extensions of the Bayesian compound covariate classifier. Based on simulation studies and analysis of gene expression microarray data, we found that proper probabilistic classification is more difficult than deterministic classification. It is important to ensure that a probabilistic classifier is well calibrated or at least not \"anticonservative\" using the methods developed here. We provide this evaluation for several probabilistic classifiers and also evaluate their refinement as a function of sample size under weak and strong signal conditions. We also present a cross-validation method for evaluating the calibration and refinement of any probabilistic classifier on any data set.","inCitations":["2eb0bd9c3ce1f48ba3ea33a404cc3965aa48999b","b4f9858e0c3239eedc2461af96d935cc5b501eb1","7bbef62a2e294fc21c67acbf1100c5cd33611c5d","09a7e77333fb00c254d4d5f166d4203010f7b919","aa6246b2150acb460e75b068a0136ac33bc868fb","784576d9ba200ca803f9b8b0c7874dbb446bde58","1c18eeffa2c647cac6b1853ca4cee7eaef08e612","41396b7b669b0e438a0b39715a1a98fdf6abc9ee","34cf084eac2f1cd1513954bf692efd58a2a96d76","17ace3bd5cbdb6f342bb9d6ab53825682ae51731","01feb65e2c373fb78e66ba8221fc0b04c2ec957f","f578cf9e8bffe393e02ccd21e72aaee1ad3b1882","565dc2aa5619112c8b58bb0ed60912e78edf9a3d","1a64fa5aa5975ee4dfed8070d1ac391b25e8a1e2","2a5b7320025982d9923a91ac11f76b51884b54d8"],"title":"Probabilistic classifiers with high-dimensional data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq069"}

Such covariates are referred as time-dependent covariates. Quantile regression offers flexible modeling of survival data by allowing the covariates to vary with quantiles. This article provides a novel quantile regression model accommodating time-dependent covariates, for analyzing survival data subject to right censoring. Our simple estimation technique assumes the existence of instrumental variables. In addition, we present a doubly-robust estimator in the sense of Robins and Rotnitzky (1992, Recovery of information and adjustment for dependent censoring using surrogate markers. In: Jewell, N. P., Dietz, K. and Farewell, V. T. (editors), AIDS Epidemiology. Boston: Birkhaäuser, pp. 297-331.). The asymptotic properties of the estimators are rigorously studied. Finite-sample properties are demonstrated by a simulation study. The utility of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using the Stanford heart transplant dataset.","inCitations":["4b472c035fd180bc42286bdde619309b3f6d857c","de0a46f3ad137161bd5ca7fb0d8ce451f673b098","136294c75e39b2ef8613195ac52ac680fdce186f"],"title":"A quantile regression model for failure-time data with time-dependent covariates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw036"}

For example, studies of skin tumorigenesis record latency time prior to the first tumor, increases in the number of tumors at each week, and the occurrence of internal tumors at the time of death. Motivated by this application, we propose a general underlying Poisson variable framework for mixed discrete outcomes, accommodating dependency through an additive gamma frailty model for the Poisson means. The model has log-linear, complementary log-log, and proportional hazards forms for count, binary and discrete event time outcomes, respectively. Simple closed form expressions can be derived for the marginal expectations, variances, and correlations.

Makuch and Simon developed a sample size formula for historical control (HC) studies with binary outcomes, assuming that the observed response rate in the HC group is the true response rate. This method was extended by Dixon and Simon to specify sample size for HC studies comparing survival outcomes. For HC studies with binary and continuous outcomes, many researchers have shown that the popular Makuch and Simon method does not preserve the nominal power and type I error, and suggested alternative approaches. For HC studies with survival outcomes, we reveal through simulation that the conditional power and type I error over all the random realizations of the HC data have highly skewed distributions. Therefore, the sampling variability of the HC data needs to be appropriately accounted for in determining sample size. A flexible sample size formula that controls arbitrary percentiles, instead of means, of the conditional power and type I error, is derived. Although an explicit sample size formula with survival outcomes is not available, the computation is straightforward. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method preserves the operational characteristics in a more realistic scenario where the true hazard rate of the HC group is unknown. A real data application of an advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical trial is presented to illustrate sample size considerations for HC studies in comparison of survival outcomes.","inCitations":["c9c48cfbda15232793e585fd7c9a84c13dac0904","71a87c6526e68568e38bf0e9fa46e79f05f31841"],"title":"Sample size considerations for historical control studies with survival outcomes.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1052495"}

A review of the statistical theory reveals that both methods call for the solution of characteristic equations to obtain the coordinate system which exhibits the correlations among multiple variables. They differ in the partitioning of the variables into sets, in the scalar quantity to be maximized in solving the characteristic equations, and in the linear regression models. An empirical example is presented to illustrate possible effects of these statistical differences on the interpretation of data. The illustration suggests that factor analysis may be more appropriate for hypothesis generating and exploratory studies, while canonical analysis should have wider application in research involving hypothesis testing and prediction.","inCitations":["225c9d13b891df0dfd9623ce1236fca6644f2127"],"title":"An Application of Factor and Canonical Analysis to Multivariate Data.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1965.tb00693.x"}

In some cases, an estimator that yields unbiased estimates of the conditional expectation for a particular partitioning of the data may be desirable. Such estimators are calibrated with respect to the partitioning. We identify the conditional expectation given a particular partitioning as a smooth parameter of the distribution of the data, where the partitioning may be defined on the covariate space or on the prediction space of the estimator. We propose a targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) procedure that updates an initial prediction estimator such that the updated estimator yields an unbiased and efficient estimator of this smooth parameter in the nonparametric statistical model. When the partitioning is defined on the prediction space of the estimator, our TMLE involves enforcing an implicit constraint on the estimator itself. We show that our resulting estimator of the smooth parameter is equal to the empirical estimator, which is also known to be unbiased and efficient in the nonparametric statistical model. We derive the TMLE for single time-point prediction and also time-dependent prediction in a counting process framework.","inCitations":["c37d30f7162e7fec10a9bc3fd36277151c177c71","8933ca1e36478b5ddc2ef37fa8d33583f0784f2e","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c"],"title":"Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Prediction Calibration","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1385"}

While these methodologies appropriately address some critical questions on the potential of a drug, they either consider the past evidence without predicting the outcome of the future trials or focus only on efficacy, failing to account for the multifaceted aspects of a successful drug development. As quantitative benefit-risk assessments could enhance decision-making, we propose a more comprehensive approach using a composite definition of success based not only on the statistical significance of the treatment effect on the primary endpoint but also on its clinical relevance and on a favorable benefit-risk balance in the next pivotal studies. For one drug, we can thus study several development strategies before starting the pivotal trials by comparing their predictive probability of success. The predictions are based on the available evidence from the previous trials, to which new hypotheses on the future development could be added. The resulting predictive probability of composite success provides a useful summary to support the discussions of the decision-makers.

As a result, outcomes are only known up to random time intervals, resulting in interval-censored data. In contrast, when estimating variable importance measures on interval-censored outcomes, practitioners often ignore the presence of interval censoring, and instead treat the data as continuous or right-censored, applying ad hoc approaches to mask the true interval censoring. In this article, we describe targeted minimum loss–based estimation (TMLE) methods tailored for estimation of binary variable importance measures with interval-censored outcomes. We demonstrate the performance of the interval-censored TMLE procedure through simulation studies and apply the method to analyze the effects of a variety of variables on spontaneous hepatitis C virus clearance among injection drug users, using data from the “International Collaboration of Incident HIV and HCV in Injecting Cohorts” project.","inCitations":["03c65cae1f568e16775a563f7b68fa260adc5b87","f8cf8f35d47f078fb2cd9ee179bcd68eae08ddc6","c916f54aed75c6aeda669535da017f94aa115e37"],"title":"Targeted Estimation of Binary Variable Importance Measures with Interval-Censored Outcomes","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2013-0009"}

Using age as a potential covariate causing heterogeneity in individuals' transmission probabilities in households consisting of adults and children, we present the results of a simulation study designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators of VEs and VE(I). We found that estimates of VE(I) have larger bias and variance compared to those of VEs. We also use the approach to compare two vaccination designs: one vaccinating both adults and children, the other only children. Simulations reveal that the design that vaccinates both adults and children provides better estimates of VEs. There is no obvious difference between the two designs in the performance of the estimates of VE(I). In regard to random effects between households and the scenarios considered, models that do not account for between-households heterogeneity produce fairly robust estimates even when household-level random effects are present.","inCitations":["1b2616086fdfdb97e01778a2b5f5f19627be6388","6ae5496c80fb7e707c656d9b5c493b6e5f1397ba","dfd6d1e72fd72ac4f5d25bdbf09bb948505e3fe3"],"title":"Estimating vaccine efficacy from outbreak size household data in the presence of heterogeneous transmission probabilities.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600719467"}

Therefore, a bridging study is usually conducted in the new region only after the test product has been approved for commercial marketing in the original region based on its proven efficacy and safety. In this paper we address the issue of analysis of clinical data generated by the bridging study conducted in the new region to evaluate the similarity for extrapolation of the foreign clinical data to the population of the new region. Information on efficacy, safety, dosage, and dose regimen of the original region cannot be concurrently obtained from the local bridging studies but available in the trials conducted in the original region. Liu et al. (2002) have proposed a Bayesian approach to synthesize the data generated by the bridging study and foreign clinical data generated in the original region for assessment of similarity based on superior efficacy of the test product over a placebo control. However, the results of the bridging studies using their approach will be overwhelmingly dominated by the results of the original region due to an imbalance of sample sizes between the regions. Therefore, in this paper we propose a Bayesian approach with the use of a mixture prior for assessment of similarity between the new and original region based on the concept of positive treatment effect. Methods for sample size determination for the bridging study are also proposed. Numerical examples illustrate applications of the proposed procedures in different scenarios.","inCitations":["270f30e853cd43fabc0ffab560f4dc6a9f7345e2","f5e68d8666e9dd758bdebbedd548403e8eb2b245","a146dad1cf294f3445f4f400bd251e22512a42e5","0f52f59865c6572e24e5905c842b30eeca0db6c4","5aa81e78fe151f5a9d337b4e17d238c3427f10e2","ee70e8071e9eff492cd3ba08e5e05570cd5541b9","e241c9719f9e052d29eef8b3e90ae11b62f6a5c5","4bdba4b94c20e7b355a8aa76880ceccba3aebb5a","f2d50a09e063f9de6ca2b1e1c45fb17e5ce3d8a4","04d6217a79f86bace111fe6ab9efe0299a746f3e"],"title":"Use of prior information for Bayesian evaluation of bridging studies.","doi":"10.1080/10543400601001501"}

We hypothesize that these two types of correlations are caused by a common spatially correlated underlying factor. Under this hypothesis, we propose a generalized common spatial factor model. The parameters are estimated using the Bayesian method and a Markov chain Monte Carlo computing technique. Our main goals are to determine which observed variables share a common underlying spatial factor and also to predict the common spatial factor. The model is applied to county-level cancer mortality data in Minnesota to find whether there exists a common spatial factor underlying the cancer mortality throughout the state.","inCitations":["13019391e4b32401620cf6f8c9dc5e236bfdea89","77cf87c275343c00fc2be4ad97148da968dc2921","f342203cf436b47dbf62e3bdb2786077d304dd62","dd5312d83251a1c24ee7bbd156fbe2be10675d45","15e80e558cf9276e088385ae9e15bc70ccd37d4e","6170c8b1896a2ec90fd5a9ba68fd26fb9683a125","66e77455649e84476c48ec3bcac1e560677dd5d7","40fcd0d13be93d88bcc141c4265f48aa7ceef9f4","11738a40c51c9acf2702ca9c43d3ff53e9a4332d","a157730fe7718bb73750aa371380856214731135","6624d4bca2586e3ef7db92ff281b5ca2dd4de0cc","5ad17b6a050da8ce023989cb0cb4a3767037a607","7771dbd9efc28357cfa558238b436cc2aa5a284d","d508ae4a6c9aa686b156b9e9930896d814354e8b","c6625ebdc68ed9cfea85e2a667922c4b0d9c5eda","329cc0b7c512a1ae673e60ec944f683f534753a4","9a6eee5f8eb7a624980cdfa38ef46e4d3eca8d23","88063d2cb19824f72b00a7e2da2d6b315afcae5d","319f6607e3f14194890f638e7a4819e4e3d41656","cd0b36f119142f97098f57a4df9dac528cedc233","c51e511d932f74e4730253faa29d82c57fddd3f5","ad968b44d42ebe9c76283c0d0f1cf465a340bf08","5fe6a16da71aa16923dc7cf430feda7626a84bdb","67fce855ff3a08e79103ce5242614df6c2a0a9c1","58de7a14eba521f9d22e397ddfe884454845a24d","1af1458863a48231acfdb9c7a306f754138353fd","e7340df4c511b1d78efa938c46a8a11df36cc28f","a2fa01ae3b6fb7b00a42a65da548dbec7eeea44f","8d95638ae126f4f41fe284fdfdf05cdb4ac1fa31","072cb8311019ca31cc715f6e017593dc8e49c40e","af1815d5245493360319ed1c2ee797bef2a39d4a","8fbfc34ac46df1bc096e093a8c928cacccbf9219","78a036bebf22a013ac33f621274fc6f6cfe8fd76","2738b188f54c12eaf92a53709f89de75fdb422f9","d11d9aea4a291348a0d848c767f3170f3ff9c026","cf5b978c803362adc10486659ca19c6493946831","af0244783cdaf8f6c91c1f0ff1429eb7fdf09803","ddf01cdcb47b613ff6e8e701d3f279197f833189","4154930ad9b5c1ec329276603c9884daa3c6df5a","3465212c7b1aff01e63514341933e6ac7a5fa58e","e253624a837e94def85a1a3213cef2f2396b654d","b845bc1d41547ae16fca6d5e149a404ea888c275","71ecf2ddccd125796f18b556eccb5c066789fba6","7458f25e290b69999e83ac4b777edb45b05d57ae","1151f7bb9efbf970c4ebc3c17707764971b0c884","271abee43f6dc2d1c73e3a4116ede847950e18d8","21efc2e6025a2561a108214c28eda65fc4a8ff47","52db1b2237717ebdace02871f85a46c32c801b5c","bf79f0f3b3e0ca08fdb9beda9d5e76def813a9cb","e65a53999b48af3ffa92d3443dfb24e9d0568038","da7e87dde1725a999370f40e2341ca2db5e5c3f7","9199f4725f6351ea6ff28ac98b265a597f855735","884070c2472ca571ad30b25f18e509263bc7d9e9","3c90a637ea1111d1c8a0617fc35498381d7df526","725c5694da30e5968138ca6f4d3b4b075a67adb6","3909bc79f72231849f7e51403662b477b8f6f469","1616c25b2469b94626cd8842cd250eaf9bde7f81","93b28869a9f689fc80f047257c45411d64108bf3","9415258764e8e1ec24f414b016fd385672799a95","df217123fc51fbff18018bc02d30ee9bcca3b05a","3d07a85b2da2518c04f923d13014970c9906b24f","ebcf8f896c9bf56bee580ce3545a45baff50fd08"],"title":"Generalized common spatial factor model.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.4.569"}

The standard workflow of the aCGH data analysis consists of 2 steps: detecting the boundaries of the regions of changed copy number by means of a segmentation algorithm (break point identification) and then labeling each region as loss, neutral, or gain with a probabilistic framework (calling procedure). In this paper, we introduce a novel calling procedure based on a mixture of truncated normal distributions, named FastCall, that aims to give aberration probabilities to segmented aCGH data in a very fast and accurate way. Both on synthetic and real aCGH data, FastCall obtains excellent performances in terms of classification accuracy and running time.","inCitations":["4974eab03be247d0e8ac4c3405524ed654a4c0ae","771fcc725fc94b51d86ab89034759e179bc500c2","f3ff22443f7ccd3990df84d5da25f722790fef2e","0ac8d18810f88ebb025835b75966925e7f2f1a85","1788d1753d19003792949d049e827a08f4fab64c","728dbb7171f1c85e0bf7dfe8c8569312d3da059d","f8ac3a4b0d8d8c18d41a6c2e3825083dacef8fd8","6f66dc05ce39165507583a21bd9d4a7ba35ce647","4e65b6fda6624b4c1263b260234e2fc366cef076","250dad8f9b90114b002f7b7c9851358aeb9401f9","56d3d99e3778b225ebd63aa9b53af58a93cd546f"],"title":"A very fast and accurate method for calling aberrations in array-CGH data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq008"}
