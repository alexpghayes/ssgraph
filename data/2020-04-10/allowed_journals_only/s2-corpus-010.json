A number of different, and apparently divergent, methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies have been proposed, including two alternative approaches that are statistically rigorous and allow for between-study variability: the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model (Rutter and Gatsonis, 2001) and bivariate random-effects meta-analysis (van Houwelingen and others, 1993), (van Houwelingen and others, 2002), (Reitsma and others, 2005). We show that these two models are very closely related, and define the circumstances in which they are identical. We discuss the different forms of summary model output suggested by the two approaches, including summary ROC curves, summary points, confidence regions, and prediction regions.","inCitations":["2dae73ca5596341f020aad0d65b22168c23d26c0","abf7d953a974c6669e23e088bfa58abad1f4d600","ceb49e133730780f10b2ff141143d917c708cdb8","7a7700589b1b08691722378cc7f1a4b2fabf1045","bfa6d4ba6b737acb6df0afdafeade0055592b61e","b029fe22adbaa58f75e8ec8002388453c098ead6","5e1f31c351be8bafb695c85a142aa449543aec3f","3a43a78e0ca767743db5144e7835be0e58fc6550","9252fe560f92e27abc6b4a4f3b85bcab71c7fdf1","ef83dc875d06ffaf1153ab7b8abb2a5409edbd29","e9d83f29b0fc13d9e15e13448445436a3ddd67ac","3b334c70cad3b4005cf3780b50e0d80726a2486c","d5b2aa9b8c629fcbca1048b8f1607d4ac9ae983b","cbabcb62287d54c6d636b93b98bfb15c331acfa3","7b8c6381470df7789da1cc7870d2c54173e06c1e","d4d4e1dee8a91663984c833f8bf74fb534d81baa","f0e295f62ace240333bda19cd5684183e255058d","22be6df277637d00570123a6d4b03ad0b19a9c50","cffaca25dc8338dbc2d0ccef47c2085651f6605f","c82061fc84162861f6fc785ce3ba1d69a1132952","f1b884949888ce1f084b634c02d91299ecbb676f","30ad9667eeaae4745032d581cabe0e324fc00175","2bb017108c8e507b9d5574f010c741c14732ae4e","bc298fc65c49c4cb06f9be1e4eeb7b7012693143","636a9bab0f0638de99a490d6f4e3efd831c23dea","9f1dd312af05c6f0edee8f9f6d47f2d693648747","f5309158cf1cee85267194e8a846549267c1a26e","d0299f63f1c1eecc0452f1c4531fead95cab7fd2","cf65597c6e366f5c8d9fb86f76929a04519968b7","c7b63648bf0e70260af4fd87a64596fd22a5150d","952bc794f3568e25ee8b0b777d6f918b5526c564","815f3bf5d54a48d1bf6bda9029a3684d85e73981","5c1d9c08984fd9f53bb39b7609973f0140e0ee24","c84415385f42816c4a596c9ef480e66bd61dc501","515ced9434369f2d49ecbe927f896e442e852656","0008bd4d851756082382415a2d4b0d3ce69978ca","105ee1ce6d279fc19b8c1d8f8ee18a36711a1557","b1c94844e63b7bcb7b698e55c05773c792235d6e","b59964c3c69ac027094a32dd7cf3210b1a99fae8","d926dcfa8baaa519d3d0ee6c4e362a4fbf907c6d","4d039093b13683cb6fd00e15a070661301a05460","2e2635be2052168f16ca57af86d0c5e0b570c783","c52eb9795a8625d3422be87f9ddd1e5a19ab5e9b","7bda2bf04825baa866a123340cc2c0e0a42a2cc5","e5864b21793304a81d5928e8b6cb8945d162fa82","c1999ecc380b38b36f9e0911f1fccc8bc0eaa72a","981cddde2b3d53a22aabea153a2707bf66f3d11d","a1fbb45bda6271883315343f3fb88166e0c1e66e","001cd42571ccbfe2a48b31c006dfcf966172b338","2e6fe42f636e5375cc3f909250c4c29269e76458","080fe7987e1bbc97372177d57267ed56fb113051","9b1722f1e5bc605824607123a9ddda42f92379e4","b8faec3626637dc52eefa48c31330547b226ea78","23fa7bce9aa82ac39f7e5dd2c5fde1a06701e784","4f11b366e954506ae121bedaa7044b1c065e832f","d60d7514ff26a2a1643c4ac257a5afa08efb759b","9004229b863973c18d8c7caf92db00b74bb43e61","1ecf01e6adbd1cafe9f9f76769d50f5cb147b7ea","aa86c139f66faee2b617a41bc67adb5b64687e38","a3525561f3daf88eec718b5df6e7ccf59792f7ff","3c657edf12a43bffb8a736d8b5e6b101a1626d86","3fb13218639f3730aee83f2f13ad730edddddfe1","75a6316572d121ab3eadde3c81b9574e63e2c52e","363449919536ca4532b4931f3e47f20ad507cedb","7d14b6ae724b1ecc9ea54334bbdd2ef58f6c46c1","0f87d370e2892d4919d025883970e4bef5e05249","9e582a13615f66daa0e2ebacce3211a25e9c2aa0","44e4dfd3fc93cf7e12e378f5db8849f9cd8262d8","070998610c198109fc55f36762592bb11572275d","c80c9370a0e0081ec1f6e2285166fac448d72c29","4f1b531b74095703f3c45bf5d85129fad568c08f","090964640993a58a72e8b9ed5bd3bcc725183ba6","a0ed0f006b11c9f18492cae08995dfabfee12041","5456791484d6f64c3629f00f649b0a17b76ebe0b","821b68b6d87afd9cdb53b2adeb3a5ec579ec2e1b","ece414bcc663d9f3691ce99696cdf7e393f547cb","042784b14a4a0b037ad937f9f95b74ee74e63f26","814401292e1785ca176af6412327f0014007fadc","9a51a9f11a87cfd85fc39c8bee5542c5a8c67072","87bf8fa37947ecbf3cf4362b4501de71cdfe30ff"],"title":"A unification of models for meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl004"}

For such data, it is common to consider models in which the different items are manifestations of a normal latent variable, which depends on covariates through a linear regression model. This article proposes a flexible Bayesian alternative in which the unknown latent variable density can change dynamically in location and shape across levels of a predictor. Scale mixtures of underlying normals are used in order to model flexibly the measurement errors and allow mixed categorical and continuous scales. A dynamic mixture of Dirichlet processes is used to characterize the latent response distributions. Posterior computation proceeds via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with predictive densities used as a basis for inferences and evaluation of model fit. The methods are illustrated using data from a study of DNA damage in response to oxidative stress.","inCitations":["300f05aa8ba4458ee5bf8e6ca627e5f600f903fd","a7f27da5049fd53cb899f78cdf7d8d13c2f87c61","ecd696e0a2abccd256478fc766c2dbbce118a398","367192563591923d5d3e8bdd8440431a29b4860e","6f4377cd45ed21f4e99b1ab3bc02c137c1e73b7c","1e1b7cd88f223c2eff6b2ed15185547d660215b1","729a73a7a82adb9682a2be18349d7b78ef0bc26f","be75381c0ed3829baa1f13d79a9e1f2166756405","3802690ae831c1a99b68d4d7e983395d1dbcd0c6","7d20d336ac5e9ec0b6c6674e418ac5e6538a509d","3f6548bd28ad8319d604a31df1ca4b9697c91848","bc87e0f71910d3186c74f0ec5c704f8389d7a654","6135ee3c8c410660cc5aee1051ba96d3fc10170b","4ab6ee997f56e9a1e994680676d2f7b9bfc93c64","1149ac484e9ba5021e440215fbc27bf3bffd7aaf","d44f25fe1355b59dd65df88f10812d5aefe62ac5","f3ba5aab40868515bd5148e05b3c6d4229023659","0937134ff31b318d254bce3242dbe2031a6738d3","596fdb90d71a7119ff34edcbbd9ce6fa54f2052d","d8ee34d3558edd6cc8516b9e03dbbd806fc41930","2b287095d3256737a1ec3631ae9c65fc9aa32d11","f77696b170b8401d4aa666529767336d11fd88a4","65664a983d2f620151dee15d667be82ee94526a3","0db67ac26050cf4b2da78212db63f2caa0b79792","0d06bcbf4bcc38029d8d2eba5c6e9710a162d093","798522dfaa2e60d7361631eb11a2eff7de8c2e05","0625e209294f6e1c0c3af58cad6a9de405fea6fb","161cce673ee538d6df51ff8f7f4f91e1b6422353","deff8496e8787eac64aa9814a35ff769ef9d6e2f","72cc610bcdaf4166839eeff04776adcea225439f","c450047813fd5fa1e07d902ea1c35ed11d43b7cd","04972dbc025306b95482b0dcb711a5b34e0ca01e","77cf87c275343c00fc2be4ad97148da968dc2921","0763c8cdfdb111c3cff82723b32e6bfdf7ae0dcc","c1f2a6e281ec8b7a1282708fc050b48852d7a371","a064bf2e6ea6dbd598df7a1ef741c05f603627e4","c07eec33ee3ee6105f2076189f89eef560e2e803","0832510cf3b8c99dadbdd304e188d6cc557b9b0a","8790853365a9dcc95c0b10dcd1825ec2213e87b0","096d3c1ef7ec711da19cad43f409626d3e16b89f","83b6d5fbdfb2e2fd8f60d6b21b958b1d705f4731","27df7ee8fe435f849d55d1f7b408a5d1ab754321","73a7ad9beb7765f0ca5ba32c596cea2fad844baf","a99eb8ba2c3187a00334168102253416271a0d55","aeac3f44d5a0460a94ff70809c120818117e186b","cb0a08ba77eab620e8e520647a89842dfbaf424f","0d6ef2364dcc405480154dd79ad5316dd290b726","ab365b954659b53aaa6a7ca6c07165501678fda6","018f29b1fbb9bb171f06dd6e84898aea5111d550","8c06386f0f20b4ada975b3077903b19f64a825cf","a40705cb20dc1487816d7657f5246a0ae23a403d","9be6cfb1a764061a27dd1018db4fffaee9b67204"],"title":"Bayesian dynamic modeling of latent trait distributions.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj025"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"We consider the joint modelling, analysis and prediction of a longitudinal binary process and a discrete time-to-event outcome. We consider data from a prospective pregnancy study, which provides day level information regarding the behaviour of couples attempting to conceive. Reproductive epidemiologists are particularly interested in developing a model for individualized predictions of time to pregnancy (TTP). A couple's intercourse behaviour should be an integral part of such a model and is one of the main focuses of the paper. In our motivating data, the intercourse observations are a long series of binary data with a periodic probability of success and the amount of available intercourse data is a function of both the menstrual cycle length and TTP. Moreover, these variables are dependent and observed on different, and nested, timescales (TTP is measured in menstrual cycles whereas intercourse is measured on days within a menstrual cycle) further complicating its analysis. Here, we propose a semiparametric shared parameter model for the joint modelling of the binary longitudinal data (intercourse behaviour) and the discrete survival outcome (TTP). Further, we develop couple-based dynamic predictions for the intercourse profiles, which in turn are used to assess the risk for subfertility (i.e. TTP longer than six menstrual cycles).","inCitations":["feab433fc3209afd55c49663b18ac1b5e641be60"],"title":"Joint analysis of longitudinal and survival data measured on nested timescales by using shared parameter models: an application to fecundity data.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12075"}

This method, called DIFFIT, aims to find an optimal balance between the fit of solutions for the 3MPCA model and the numbers of components. The achievement of DIFFIT is compared with that of two other methods, both based on two-way PCAs, by means of a simulation study. It was found that DIFFIT performed considerably better than the other methods in indicating the numbers of components. The 3MPCA model can be estimated by the TUCKALS3 algorithm, which is an alternating least squares algorithm. In a study of how sensitive TUCKALS3 is at hitting local optima, it was found that, if the numbers of components are specified correctly, TUCKALS3 never hits a local optimum. The occurrence of local optima increased as the difference between the numbers of underlying components and the numbers of components as estimated by TUCKALS3 increased. Rationally initiated TUCKALS3 runs hit local optima less often than randomly initiated runs.","inCitations":["8f36bfdb0c88d898aa9aa0c4b583f6a237779c8b","8bd1c50ef2fc9fb7402aff10996d11bb3a90d0f5","5da225800797d8d7654570c483bee1eb4ebcdbc9","6ba2304dcb8167273b80c1202746af51b8e6e6e4","618c49de73f6a2b775caf093f32a92be3458739a","34e55227e19bb6fd5971df20b88e649d6266797d","b92775b2366a5b008a1c8a067491d41cb5c8739a","8c1398ceb5d6252be0f99bd0bc757f66ee72a697","55c41ef6677e4c115623a82f6a4f15959b3b021f","28933fa316b37c535dab2c5bc4345db62c4f981e","398abbdcf39b39f548e23dbb7e8fa286853b4c14","0914b65fc1e1d2e72f356d6c0a0386be0ecb4b10","86be995c6feb70f0804858d4ff835f70ab8f39eb","3f0f9bb373de82e6c6a56ac60a6b0e11be6e0996","66e72a973c71c1c490490e67257c5e3ae4aa433e","6b44f1b9c05d27b7c095d4948393ff2b092bf3fe","8f63165de0a1e72d2b5dd26ef42c9dc6c4ceeed1","72557289d9f8b94ac436aab6ff5afaf00c9be9de","8921f1917e4451f22bceb8f4ab105e8d4de9d701","76cb16f062e4a0470a2b72ee14f30c93fc4fac2e","416c6f24701c91589d7e719bb770387ab37635e1","a08e50d6d1d253006ce901acad28f4518ad44d8f","6f47ac06c29741154bfc8205d1ed17136a53a9ca","7b76fb4ac7ea8592ff128157f2ccc96dee403069","e02453401d50e27c7da56b0ef5aaf14219cf123a","ff0e34f8b6cb56b717474233e7b53c10c0421cff","9ed97682bfc7c71aa76636947166789c1f1d487a","f5af096b1512712dc2113ad10c0898861549bed7","bd38d9baa88562c1e387d1c66398e9f08d6e68bd","6d923aee66ecdb6135b0b4a5758281287768c42c","60a3ac709ecfacbb5062badd340d60c49eee51c3","798810ca3f9305251fcbbb32d521c0ccccf11571","6cd762e7cb1301abd0ddbb265dd9c7661ffc0458","d61d4bb35966fef24e0ebad2c3e860854a9b5763","0b00c17e0808efae825bd7e70718e45c6eb96eb2","570f62c6a9f73eccb4dae397f8371c409c273dca","3e7a611fb36d0881b77c81da5d1335bf819ed85b","646ede580b28ca6bf1522eb287670ec4738967d3","eac46481188f6016011caedc5ba3359103a134ca","da12e7b6fa7b45ea7e846df86cf01eab4492ad1d","05ca917d566862d3981689c29c33d29b6cf2c7b7","e5bbb9c8320d24972b285bee48584c2e6d8e1cf3","2b4618ee7993caceddfd5915b73744464dfd6d04","b62e8bdef1af2d4d4dd6b659a49def5b185ab8cd","c1812a27bd06386ac37b82530150ef0e852a4b68","e3ebcd7a70c0ed25a68aed9bc38e32a9130e1937","ab859a5b63bf7a04606bd3b66995c39011d8b943","f1de836fa45de8d43c4c5774dd6ba5b1686f8459","a4e23a533c2a9cd96302a9a6b23bea65edb81a77","94118feff1a3bd9ce3a34fa0f4a8783c2498bbd5","faa673107db12488d809da06903c1845422543ab","c05bd176c341cbe2a3baf504508930a4c8f47b90","a6a53b783ec3e01f91696b6ec846e3aac15f4a3d","e0fbc8cfdce3c187bed9f7e741fd0657ba4801b9","e7720c6e9b72bc2665a94587d89265589489a54b","1805348d08bd72862347ce49ac0b813959f053a3","f4c40ed2fe8df279caa86ec588154513b6151d97","0c16a4223a3fc3f9301895e77c2c1361ee73ddbb","0eeec6e0948983a716cbd6e4cdebcc4820328fcf","461310e2b0b556442e450fadbf466c87d03e0160","5979666682daad35c7cf72e139902c000cbd6b37","ac7db38acdb0d2d634fc1212ca3f67b07a2946ba","16671b2dc89367ce4ed2a9c241246a0cec9ec10e","858901405086056361f8f1839c2f3d65fc86a748","3de0e80837eb30963a5d008b4a7767b13a343a05","eb856397454773c0cd4d22f3ec22d64c6b0cd648","f0c486f3d437dedbb63558a24b2f49e35bd46dcc","3ccdce88469bf3553f4307bb444b00040a1bfa38","85ea076e5114c4309d1f1fe6cb0a386397c72390","b2559e38b73e0a28fb1209ae2ffb168de01be25c","9acbb027d92c427daeed1c10ec0905f7f36b83c7","a4c24d56fa41481593f0cfca9800fbfb4f8eea71","9a44d6206f61aa625e095165d9574abad99c674f","976e9e9694f891939b2b2335b53c2d62b4839e6e","e975e5422474d069ae1db58bb87aea33bd505b34","014560136ee40e8fccbd606c051bc9683526a856","1f3876a4be8f110dfa957b32f026cd2802d63fe0","98d054f3271fd47157add5e8a487f945d8ba0642","1a0a0c3193770c3b4a43783efbdaeb263f513dea","62da66e6ec03fc1f84246c5b7b4793472940ce8f","71f693b1ff03cc4ac3fb105b8b5bc14bbee5dc74","827f1a29909b3fbc056d24e32b8f73a9eee79f14"],"title":"Three-mode principal components analysis: choosing the numbers of components and sensitivity to local optima.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159132"}

In this paper, we study the sparse estimation for censored median regression models, which is an important problem for high dimensional survival data analysis. In particular, a new procedure is proposed to minimize an inverse-censoring-probability weighted least absolute deviation loss subject to the adaptive LASSO penalty and result in a sparse and robust median estimator. We show that, with a proper choice of the tuning parameter, the procedure can identify the underlying sparse model consistently and has desired large-sample properties including root-n consistency and the asymptotic normality. The procedure also enjoys great advantages in computation, since its entire solution path can be obtained efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a resampling method to estimate the variance of the estimator. The performance of the procedure is illustrated by extensive simulations and two real data applications including one microarray gene expression survival data.","inCitations":["062792b74de213750bc6bb4d449c839bfa5dc77e","979a07577411b5f5284912682bf5eedd93cbc8ff","0102f4695955d571c07c92158a4bd91c53ee0893","12b45d54e50d9855735f94165191582d11a83ff1","f9a3358619fb9f2de7fef5c152a7bec6395e3a7a","12376f1bc3d08a9e2632098cd323f97df436ff5d","2be6c7b35d07af2108224e08fa4bf814b0721857","8963209b68bc27ebe9f0be41e5ecf7659b46aa42","b91dfbdda0bec4e0b2d528e35ed5267af334e6b2","6b1d190125c947c7130008f5361e8c81d49fb16f","757eb7ee2e9e6637eacc0f3019d041fc249a2537","aa08cae3a61b099d03fee98e15fea5e3f9d27540"],"title":"Sparse Estimation and Inference for Censored Median Regression.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2010.01.043"}

Approximate tests are developed in both cases and the accuracy of the approximation is numerically investigated. The results are illustrated with an example. Even though the literature on univariate bioequivalence testing addresses average bioequivalence, variance bioequivalence and subject-by-formulation interaction, the literature on multivariate bioequivalence deals only with the problem of average bioequivalence.

This is easily comprehensible because only one confidence level is used to assess which margins within the interval bounded by the maximum margin can be ruled out. If different confidence intervals are used, e.g., the interval generated from the intent-to-treat population is used for testing superiority and the interval generated from the per-protocol population is used for testing noninferiority, the problem of multiplicity will surface and the adjustment of alpha for each testing may be needed. All these predicate on the condition that at least a certain element of the maximum allowable noninferiority margin, whether it is the entire margin or the fraction of the active control effect to be retained, must be fixed in advance. None of these elements can be allowed to be influenced directly or indirectly by any analysis of the noninferiority trial data. Otherwise, the noninferiority analysis may be invalid.","inCitations":["0fc0bcc32055786b3d5a6af75aa039ad76c883e3","c4827861ea0c8d33b5d71fb9cd9d4b80a327177e","15db4dd620177ba77358b3855f79248afbbe1123","b537abfa7084c5085727f33c669bd633005f7a2e"],"title":"Multiple testing of noninferiority hypotheses in active controlled trials.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120037183"}

Instead, the probability of assignment varies from patient to patient depending on patients baseline covariates. This often results in a non-comparable treatment groups due to treatment imbalance. As a result, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that the method of propensity score analysis be employed to overcome this problem. In this note, a formula for sample size calculation is developed based on a proposed weighted Mantel-Haenszel test on the strata defined by the propensity score analysis. It was shown that the sample size formula derived by Nam (1998) based on the test statistic proposed by Gart (1985) is a special case of the sample size formula derived in this note.","inCitations":["8568b68cacc668fbb514b59949c09de5b1798016","47df62fecc9f04fe262a5ded74c439f5e28b67f8","07825e81b69ce71a703ad966c9823110558a4fa2","1455db4a084eaad50a7786c792c9fe0ba86692d6","e65657eb5a731031e93179da528c662d6b7b8274","da275635a96362f9b9ffbe2f7957bd03363719c4","251c87f7165d281e1a8dc44bf1c81913b178eaec","e06d61e4cd02a4d1fc40e484f7ba5550dd11ee6e","45042bc8559ca58c3f9eba17c68091b1171b7f82","68bb4923de946e91fec02c82db205fa1fab7dca2","556c1c8926408c9641fa6b2374d7eb1922e5242e","34c08138fa51ab9e0f749908b2380699f7d476b7"],"title":"A note on sample size calculation based on propensity analysis in nonrandomized trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400601044790"}

To check for such assumptions, we present a non-parametric regression method, P-splines regression, with additional asymmetric discrete penalties enforcing the constraints. We show that the corresponding loss function is convex and present a Newton-Raphson algorithm to optimize.

A common situation arises when counts are collected in small areas, that is, where the expected count is very low, and disease risks underlying the map are spatially correlated. Traditional p-value-based methods, which control the false discovery rate (FDR) by means of Poisson p-values, might achieve small sensitivity in identifying risk in small areas. This problem is the focus of the present work, where a Bayesian approach which performs a test to evaluate the null hypothesis of no risk over each SMR and controls the posterior FDR is proposed. A Bayesian hierarchical model including spatial random effects to allow for extra-Poisson variability is implemented providing estimates of the posterior probabilities that the null hypothesis of absence of risk is true. By means of such posterior probabilities, an estimate of the posterior FDR conditional on the data can be computed. A conservative estimation is needed to achieve the control which is checked by simulation. The availability of this estimate allows the practitioner to determine nonarbitrary FDR-based selection rules to identify high-risk areas according to a preset FDR level. Sensitivity and specificity of FDR-based rules are studied via simulation and a comparison with p-value-based rules is also shown. A real data set is analyzed using rules based on several FDR levels.","inCitations":["1f82af4d7f5e41a6313a6851ca748145798e3b61","936ad0c88603fe8aa885facf6e9b62dea87a28df","6c83e2d29d1618e65089aac26825d565816f54ac","a7ccce42518e93da967ca788ab09eb9a94684453","0be651670e303b6254511351eec4ed428d576ffe","919a531bf995f427dd540a8f65d0ad667ba11e79","f1ec243d167d1ca69b4112fe70523a047a9038c2","2e61ea4f8c4797931e3a749dc5b2080221cf6a19","60809f56f5cd1c838f94385586eb04f97cc7fca5","010f706dfae9d04b8c792adbe52e38db28801a94","6ba13c951fdc3cc472a8ceeba02142299236f1f4","1a96cd1895499f313908531cbcc8590b4d238149","b180c50ee294d2148e187148c472141d53fbd947","cf6d6de60e0a94f6d4acef37ea4c751689d72cbd","ab0894f700577adc723ac2eb10315bbd73f35394","2d57d9ab72dee8bb2ed30cdf6559b559f9bc91af"],"title":"Multiple testing on standardized mortality ratios: a Bayesian hierarchical model for FDR estimation.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq040"}

An optimally tapered matching solves two problems simultaneously: it optimally divides the single comparison population into nonoverlapping comparison groups and optimally pairs members of the focal group with members of each comparison group. We show how to use the optimal assignment algorithm in a new way to solve the optimally tapered matching problem, with implementation in R. This issue often arises in studies of groups Defined by race, gender, or other categorizations such that equitable public policy might require an understanding of the mechanisms that produce disparate outcomes, where certain specific mechanisms would be judged illegitimate, necessitating reform.

This is because the higher-order semi-partial correlation calculation using a recursive formula requires an enormous number of recursive calculations to obtain the correlation coefficients. To resolve this difficulty, we derive a general matrix formula of the semi-partial correlation for fast computation. The semi-partial correlations are then implemented on an R package ppcor along with the partial correlation. Owing to the general matrix formulas, users can readily calculate the coefficients of both partial and semi-partial correlations without computational burden. The package ppcor further provides users with the level of the statistical significance with its test

There is confusion about the appropriate parameterization, how to interpret the parameters, what the meaning is of the various parameterizations found in the literature, and which parameterization best approximates the statistical inferences produced when fitting the Hill equation to data. In this paper, we present several equivalent versions of the Hill model; show that they are equivalent in terms of yielding the same prediction for a given dose, and are equivalent to the four-parameter logistic model in this same sense; and deduce which parameterization is optimal in the sense of having the least statistical curvature and preferable multicollinearity.","inCitations":["77659b71e752b1d95f50870b518949d4bd653d20","86b9524390c1ab21c81e7f13f444c4e0ecef46be","febb2e74b07a7072b3659f3f3f9351445fa1866a","f4c7b801ec218ce03a22edf68407dca650f1f967","41155035c2d953bd503378e3485c545ee49efd67","45a0a181eae168252b4416d70f55e0923099278e","cdb1cd18d0b0750e6f2b6edda81db8828065aaf9","f7bf221b0cb27dae8b9edce042ac979b3fd09fa4","960e2a2f24f9e5c5331064ab1640a785477483de","dfbd95ab12ba56f26a5b9f320a134911bd2036c6"],"title":"Pharmacodynamic models: parameterizing the hill equation, Michaelis-Menten, the logistic curve, and relationships among these models.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.756496"}

Often, it is desirable to examine relationships among these variables both within and across regions. An existing modeling technique called spatial factor analysis has been used and assumes that a common spatial factor underlies all the variables and causes them to be related to one another. An extension of this technique considers that there may be more than one underlying factor, and that relationships among the underlying latent variables are of primary interest. However, due to the complicated nature of the covariance structure of this type of data, existing methods are not satisfactory. We thus propose a generalized spatial structural equation model. In the first level of the model, we assume that the observed variables are related to particular underlying factors. In the second level of the model, we use the structural equation method to model the relationship among the underlying factors and use parametric spatial distributions on the covariance structure of the underlying factors. We apply the model to county-level cancer mortality and census summary data for Minnesota, including socioeconomic status and access to public utilities.","inCitations":["b02dc1faf572b30278c22d1ec62e348b00af76b4","a157730fe7718bb73750aa371380856214731135","7771dbd9efc28357cfa558238b436cc2aa5a284d","11738a40c51c9acf2702ca9c43d3ff53e9a4332d","6fbe5a4c634044ff8ba7bef20c905ef8dd805c79","6619378dd313cad05794b95f13e72d6b88ec16f8","13019391e4b32401620cf6f8c9dc5e236bfdea89","77cf87c275343c00fc2be4ad97148da968dc2921","60dc43e733080902c3a8a730b4b1a6159ff6f0b9","249fd826d3902a4cd095bcc9a7a56828c1b98b94","5020dc9cc0da903b64ddcf60c0ff30e02ff94b63","df217123fc51fbff18018bc02d30ee9bcca3b05a","8d95638ae126f4f41fe284fdfdf05cdb4ac1fa31","ad968b44d42ebe9c76283c0d0f1cf465a340bf08","af0244783cdaf8f6c91c1f0ff1429eb7fdf09803","287fbc86a518964299963e4a107e35367a0b82a3","d11d9aea4a291348a0d848c767f3170f3ff9c026","de02944e5e662749075379e08a05072fc3aaf796","5ad17b6a050da8ce023989cb0cb4a3767037a607","072cb8311019ca31cc715f6e017593dc8e49c40e","f342203cf436b47dbf62e3bdb2786077d304dd62","b982a43f32bc8acf2925f52a121677c11729081b","da7e87dde1725a999370f40e2341ca2db5e5c3f7"],"title":"Generalized spatial structural equation models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi026"}

In such cases, it may be feasible to fix some model parameters at prespecified values while concentrating on estimating some other parameters. This paper formulates such a model fitting process through a model segregation approach. The statistical properties of this procedure are studied using the theory of estimating equations and optimal estimating functions. The dependency of the new parameter estimates on those of the prespecified parameter estimates is characterized for several commonly used estimating equations. A rescaled model fit statistic is proposed.

Therefore, psychologists have devoted considerable attention to quantifying the extent to which ratings agree with each other. Two main approaches to analysing rater agreement data can be distinguished. While the first approach focuses on the development of summary statistics that index rater agreement, the second models the association pattern among the observers' ratings. With the modelling approach three groups of models can be distinguished: latent class models, simple quasisymmetric agreement models, and mixture models. This paper discusses a class of mixture models that is defined by its characteristic of having a quasi-symmetric log-linear representation. This class of models has two interesting properties. First, the simple quasi-symmetric agreement models can be shown to be members of this class. Therefore, the results of a rater agreement analysis based on a simple quasi-symmetric agreement model may be interpreted in the mixture model framework. Second, since the mixture models readily provide a familiar measure of rater reliability, it is possible to obtain a model-based estimate of rater reliability from the simple quasi-symmetric agreement models. The suggested class of mixture models will be illustrated using data from a persuasive communication study in which three raters classified respondents on the basis of their elicited cognitive responses.","inCitations":["82ed7f7872232bdf34457976385931ecd24d1a06","0f7a47f18f339c4cb209bc1aabdb31de44d197d5","a2f3df3f0d56b0c204a3b518581854bf170ea7e6","64e3b2d4854a59959a6d14ed0d1680928717ce7b","f8fbf9341c4aa2b18be6a245c103880f63973879","5ed93aaf67805208857ec8396ed3f0426c302c40","3b9612c841c0cd392160b091d185f152102c8bee","44ff87070d00ea6222069c0ecb85537ccb1b3d6a","5b578ad0548028aaddd6b18d426e1859ac936830","cfdbf99f9f3ecdf16d1f8a69640fe275605e73fe","ac1e6aecf05fb666aab2be27e97f7a84e1b6df4c"],"title":"A mixture model approach to indexing rater agreement.","doi":"10.1348/000711002760554598"}

The usual procedures of sequential analysis based on the \"independent increments\" property are no longer valid due to the heterogeneity of the study subjects, as pointed out by Cook and Lawless. We focus on the aspect of study planning and consider a special model (Poisson process with frailty) to investigate the effects of frailty (or subject heterogeneity). We prescribe the valid procedures and provide convenient tables for computing stopping boundaries and sample sizes. The methodology is illustrated through an example of an animal experiment with recurrent tumors, using procedures such as group sequential tests and repeated confidence intervals. Minimal cost analysis is considered for determining the optimal combination of study duration and sample size.","inCitations":["a3cc702037847908279247dcb97ba5ac10b63227","1cc439940abd79014db89ffed777bc79c29f2bf8","40f06efbee72fb1ccd9b26d4e27f5bf6bf0670d2","0aa88697867cd85c6fce3cc1c22bed4f690198e7","be876ef6cc35206ef2512e4072ab1374437ea100","ddc0d8e8513949ecea3d2a28be44eb2accf8b57c","1c4442e0251ff758a3f0e497a1e416fa85ebaf37","a491668346dbe1c6d6f0e29abf1fbd1c819606f0","090e6c9926263ba0563f37609187801e257fc229","1f6685af82d5054fd77e54d40fe2c031c8de8aa0","1f44fcbc7f3308a6ae6ec4d7d399937c369e82ac"],"title":"Group sequential procedures for repeated events data with frailty.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101183"}

The classification of animals after each experiment is considered and the chi-square test is proposed to test a homogeneity between treatment groups. A mixture type of nonlinear mixed-effects model with repeated measurements is considered, assuming that the onset and/or remission of disease is the fixed effect as well as the random effect. Statistical inference on the parameters of the disease curves is discussed. The proposed model is shown to be efficient for comparing the disease curves with different treatments.

In this article we illustrate the potential effects of latent variables on testing dependence and the resulting impact on multiple inference, we briefly review the method of surrogate variable analysis proposed by Leek and Storey (PNAS 2008; 105:18718-18723), and assess that method via simulations intended to mimic the complexity of feature dependence observed in real-world microarray data. The method is also assessed via application to a recent Merck microarray data set. Both simulation and case study results indicate that surrogate variable analysis can offer a viable strategy for tackling the multiple testing dependence problem when the features follow a potentially complex correlation structure, yielding improvements in the variability of false positive rates and increases in power.","inCitations":["dc9ba3cb52b2ab9a10bf8b778c0956527bebd6a1","ee5460d37fc4112f9e7f1645cb334ad8a56f3a65","8a337c714b4dd82e6d12db33b1ad0cfcac454b65"],"title":"Evaluating surrogate variables for improving microarray multiple testing inference.","doi":"10.1002/pst.466"}

Although there is typically a general temporal trend, which affects all areas similarly, abrupt changes may occur in a particular area, e.g. due to emergence of localized predictors/risk factor(s) or impact of a new policy. Detection of areas with \"unusual\" temporal patterns is therefore important as a screening tool for further investigations. In this paper, we propose BaySTDetect, a novel detection method for short-time series of small area data using Bayesian model choice between two competing space-time models. The first model is a multiplicative decomposition of the area effect and the temporal effect, assuming one common temporal pattern across the whole study region. The second model estimates the time trends independently for each area. For each area, the posterior probability of belonging to the common trend model is calculated, which is then used to classify the local time trend as unusual or not. Crucial to any detection method, we provide a Bayesian estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR). A comprehensive simulation study has demonstrated the consistent good performance of BaySTDetect in detecting various realistic departure patterns in addition to estimating well the FDR. The proposed method is applied retrospectively to mortality data on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in England and Wales between 1990 and 1997 (a) to test a hypothesis that a government policy increased the diagnosis of COPD and (b) to perform surveillance. While results showed no evidence supporting the hypothesis regarding the policy, an identified unusual district (Tower Hamlets in inner London) was later recognized to have higher than national rates of hospital readmission and mortality due to COPD by the National Health Service, which initiated various local enhanced services to tackle the problem. Our method would have led to an early detection of this local health issue.","inCitations":["80ac60852c787ffe564bc0af63856d6497f27b4a","d38fbeb52b57f947c5aab790e8a322bf51101f00","ebb8affedb815dcc6c85e1e04804518eee71fb06","85f96424bbe60dbbc339f276ce2108a0f430ac24","3780845d9986bcac6f14086edfeff5840b57e75d","7809664799f01b300241ac9239057a883e81670d","00f8e22eca2302af43055b1bcc9fbed5b5bfc73e","d5feda7aafc43606b7072512f9abf2f790b39ae1","428e347830c7ceb639ac088d37a66385305be68b","0e81e4eae4b976b30a572d567893d346eb692f86","c0b3e35bb3cff113aa0a1a1bbfeadd5206b07f3c","f5960e41a15c1054dd1952398fd64f9192a60e42","30164f63203a0805716c8fc70f65a24cbd32532e","c0ac409379dcca86a5ede8ed74cce77f0f703256","02f37160c15dce096bb4d564f1514ec8da717d85","837d6ed0b0022b7d31d5407d75ebde5bc0479d6a","1e3b0c3364c5007e487fc791756d12e80d78f95f","b8d987efab0803521ed0db581024d2cf1b091a86","69f4d4de0f8bc2b773207bd3e454b4b3723b22c6","c3e2bc626d5d9a7166d2fe6425dbf10c7c15c80e","cd0b36f119142f97098f57a4df9dac528cedc233"],"title":"BaySTDetect: detecting unusual temporal patterns in small area data via Bayesian model choice.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs005"}
