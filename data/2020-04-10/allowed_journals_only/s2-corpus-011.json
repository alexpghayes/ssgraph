PET and fMRI produce massive data sets that contain both temporal correlations from repeated scans and complex spatial correlations. Several methods exist for handling temporal correlations, some of which rely on transforming the response data to induce either a known or an independence covariance structure. Despite the presence of spatial correlations between the volume elements (voxels) comprising a brain scan, conventional methods perform voxel-by-voxel analyses of measured brain activity. We propose a two-stage spatio-temporal model for the estimation and testing of localized activity. Our second-stage model specifies a spatial auto-regression, capturing correlations within neural processing clusters defined by a data-driven cluster analysis. We use maximum likelihood methods to estimate parameters from our spatial autoregressive model. Our model protects against type-I errors, enables the detection of both localized and regional activations (including volume of interest effects), provides information on functional connectivity in the brain, and establishes a framework to produce spatially smoothed maps of distributed brain activity for each individual. We illustrate the application of our model using PET data from a study of working memory in individuals with schizophrenia.","inCitations":["b6ecfae676c1972e6a4aef1309e2154e8acba34f","505672c2b9043af77ff21c51d8eb0ea205848479","028bd4b5ee12e059f6a2365bd5135e9acdb4538e","c0533354c8f915fd26b4723d2b6c8cce78c14ab2","cb12807dca2cfd9fdc50e1be8904f824e5db1b5f","985fe220999c5b627e98f70c040ab26655b01d56","c371a66219365e539147f1b8e79cfbeb6bc1ce55","b8155c427e5a8b1ced3c69be0f52a3c96cbc0601","0cb21e5a8c2a8c502cd708b75493598e3123109f","6e6ba10815bb7a0e2541c0640d11b6e45c650371","6677b5195d5e819abdf56657a95812141df2f7db","478ae20e7b44172b3405024de3ad4592105be865","2c83d93c12a0f55975c22f2ff716f79214a15eb3","998551d5c84d269e79bcc961df9288a97fb7a656","965fd572d819dc7159c985e05606ea8c444eccdd","b43e947ab798ee5aa378cc99282deb060df8b641","7a87d3e0de3c0dff3ca3b4452033bde8a458cdfa","502aaa99adad4a0fd0f6d11ce3e89c7e7cbe5e43","54497bffc7fb03253aff17610f13ec5f3409628c","cc2b7654b60fe0d49f2a900d520cafeaefae21e5","4b8d6bb9eb2457ddd85b6e32c6c6f3e2fe9f6a69","15ccf1e7eb230fb9e1cfc526858a7c5cc801582b","bb0e511cf5a6572f34c9a06db3f4e1028f16701f","54533a96ad906a0770bfe90a8134f5d544f76ddd","5085499af8371ed0e33948ab74da3c8778379817","ee7f867739a0d638997bb0f63b6ad18a38bd5be7","b71e05a1f8019218319381d16ca05c9cc7d79f47"],"title":"Spatio-temporal modeling of localized brain activity.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi027"}

This is because they converge to quantities that depend on the censoring distribution. The magnitude of the bias relative to the theoretical Kendall's tau measure of association between truncation and failure due to censoring has not been studied, and so its importance in real problems is not known. We quantify this bias in order to assess the practical usefulness of the estimators. Furthermore, we propose inverse probability weighted versions of the conditional Kendall's tau estimators to remove the effects of censoring and provide asymptotic results for the estimators. In simulations, we demonstrate the decrease in bias achieved by these inverse probability weighted estimators. We apply the estimators to the Channing House data set and an AIDS incubation data set.","inCitations":["2ba211c959403f99b580d7ff93d7affc8d74b3c3","b6a26baa5aa1b178a4ed1d5134ddbcec75572716","5d6fa95a6e6072713cfffa96cfc97037cc7a9fe8"],"title":"Eliminating bias due to censoring in Kendall's tau estimators for quasi-independence of truncation and failure","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2013.11.018"}

However, it is a challenging problem to compute the likelihood of non-neutral models for the population allele frequency dynamics, given the observed temporal DNA data. Here, we develop a novel spectral algorithm to analytically and efficiently integrate over all possible frequency trajectories between consecutive time points. This advance circumvents the limitations of existing methods which require fine-tuning the discretization of the population allele frequency space when numerically approximating requisite integrals. Furthermore, our method is flexible enough to handle general diploid models of selection where the heterozygote and homozygote fitness parameters can take any values, while previous methods focused on only a few restricted models of selection. We demonstrate the utility of our method on simulated data and also apply it to analyze ancient DNA data from genetic loci associated with coat coloration in horses. In contrast to previous studies, our exploration of the full fitness parameter space reveals that a heterozygote-advantage form of balancing selection may have been acting on these loci.","inCitations":["037a2007c0817584dcf6b8f812a8d2799c627ea8","a79f0232d673f8e09fd4ba886e1b8b47ef465b4f","3b277c0bdf9bba6f743e0b3198bb3bd9117e9eda","dfc6ceb8e4c10c3493d9098e81534ff5f700f533","a2cf32c12bc45ae2474248d88033e851effaaeb7","204f8b73f54758cc1d2acefda6afa04ebf7bfd15","4c0a8b542db06792a5031a4402332cbf25fe3471","a274879ae2b3fdb4bd2e49046d7b55ead3c14a96","e4d66750c28a876d96a816697b99f87bddd55aad","bcd5aa033d1881cfcb770f803d62d74e6f363f04","0c9e6595c95e33ded9d2ad99069b037cd2928aea","2c9dc2b8f1cd0e144943b8f16a497c6f3da84840","91c4a5092c2ed04924006f51b9c395934f5cf419","282361726e21cb511209f33ede0defa793c25f4b","1861712d237bdfa4eeb814e596a8a8f91cfb91c2","363d1ba33e71ad9bb769b9b7976fa3b402e301fb","7957c27d36674dcb022ca88ac4917aa5ee619354","2fe8f73d3499e6b83e3dcd27ab7f372d39142f61","9d53d46f31aa9a7a5c7247913e6b1402bbd13d43","ad809d9d73f20944e9569421511c355e386e1e15","54114e8b5bc749623546bf923fedc63c12f4b20f","0f3b8a5c02cced66e65f9f8c2ee5fccdac8ca6db","b28c44c3be02541584c2a191483986ebdb0d8a89","e8d1cf6b481a9fef5ddc0e8abe565bef858f6d66","dbe75f7527400e87f704d27b2122da9fe0cb7377","1b63dff8433b41368e137c200ab09315ec881f48","20f7d7f69a4d2b2d655f466ecfffa5d1de0ed766","7d2d52509a3223858c50c08a14ead00819e6ed26","b0c2a6de7f767fd544799a33a2246c135fc6f3bf","7f22e87ac01e28b23988ccbc2d854351d2af5307","a52dd7e6357a7ba33577cb7714d5463733d0f7e9","326536a7aa30047125927ea2f021bd049ee1b59d","4c427979a29d6717e5438386a13bd6904d7a9efa"],"title":"A Novel Spectral Method for Inferring General Diploid Selection from Time Series Genetic Data.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS764"}

Using a suitable adaptation of generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data, we propose a straightforward methodology for estimating the parameters indexing the conditional means and variances of the process interevent (i.e. gap) times. The proposed methodology permits the use of both time-fixed and time-varying covariates, as well as transformations of the gap times, creating a flexible and useful class of methods for analyzing gap-time data. Censoring is dealt with by imposing a parametric assumption on the censored gap times, and extensive simulation results demonstrate the relative robustness of parameter estimates even when this parametric assumption is incorrect. A suitable large-sample theory is developed. Finally, we use our methods to analyze data from a randomized trial of asthma prevention in young children.","inCitations":["77c79ad64ab6dd71796096d2cbd80f99b78164c0","2bd0f9c308e73c61f77166458f1fe1c656aaa1d7","058e840fdc5e74e29022dfde7a05d8e8dd8bf865","1fb50136045b4335dc711cebbb37c97d226b8f3d","6c0cbc44c073cc07c0c3e4148512f996a01fd88b","3c070bcf5a39058e36b36bdf40ffbd5a1785610a","72627846394f415a96578f83d68aab75ca03e9df"],"title":"Conditional GEE for recurrent event gap times.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp004"}

Supplementary materials, including an appendix and an R package, are available online.","inCitations":["25600e96c387978fbc59a3f4826cf6fc25d1e4b0","c5779b6a3a0de8c6030f49417f4a75bd91f5925b","649420867dd3e8b8b462a65e1986b65baf16972a","b4f60bec569f417ce709ba8a9646c13c9775a501","387c51f4570781e3a5a6e44e466bee430cc4b800","fd57300607600a3b14e9e45b7da74b3f46eae890","324d922a51879cbf6a10430bb83c4b6be27a6e9f","03b3b8b9bdd1e8c77c18603ff23dd19e3c6a059c","ee5ac12b89fb0e6d93a132962c65c7c392b71939","840eb906d5c7fac3fbe0c5c3e86f459d59d92427","e9ab0a678a93d8531165b5fb388dc132c0d2ace8","a6230c869c8165c2ea0edad9e06ac86bf6e7fcc1","2114a95bd362f4c8e83d40a5ca1796b930e2c85e","a82ac2ea39cc800d9714198f1ced7824264a14ae"],"title":"Massively parallel nonparametric regression, with an application to developmental brain mapping.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2012.733549"}

We introduce a fast, end-to-end approach for approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) based on fully convolutional neural networks. The method enables users of ABC to derive simultaneously the posterior mean and variance of multidimensional posterior distributions directly from raw simulated data. Once trained on simulated data, the convolutional neural network is able to map real data samples of variable size to the first two posterior moments of the relevant parameter's distributions. Thus, in contrast to other machine learning approaches to ABC, our approach allows us to generate reusable models that can be applied by different researchers employing the same model. We verify the utility of our method on two common statistical models (i.e., a multivariate normal distribution and a multiple regression scenario), for which the posterior parameter distributions can be derived analytically. We then apply our method to recover the parameters of the leaky competing accumulator (LCA) model and we reference our results to the current state-of-the-art technique, which is the probability density estimation (PDA). Results show that our method exhibits a lower approximation error compared with other machine learning approaches to ABC. It also performs similarly to PDA in recovering the parameters of the LCA model.","inCitations":["5e583bf0ccab9b25849c924bff514b0a60a7a13a","205fdd0614885fc5bfc517d4d7b9f144b500768d","68048b5e8fc6e72b35c1f4cca2e40a5642fd69a6"],"title":"Towards end-to-end likelihood-free inference with convolutional neural networks.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12159"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2010,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In microarray experiments, the goal is often to examine many genes, and select some of them for additional investigation. Traditionally, such a selection problem has been formulated as a multiple testing problem. When the genes of interest are genes with unequal distribution of gene expression under different conditions, multiple testing methods provide an appropriate framework for addressing the selection problems. However, when the genes of interest are a set of genes with the largest difference in gene expression under different conditions, multiple testing methods do not directly address the selection goal and sometimes lead to biased conclusions. For such cases, we propose two methods based on the statistical ranking and selection framework to directly address the selection goal. The proposed methods have an inherent optimization nature in that the selection is optimized according to either a prespecified minimum correct selection ratio (r* selection) or probability of making a correct selection (P* selection). These methods are compared with the multiple testing method that controls the tail probability of the proportion of false positives. Both simulation studies and real data applications provide insight into the fundamental difference between the multiple testing methods and the proposed methods in the way of addressing different selection goals. It has been shown that the proposed methods provide a clear advantage over the multiple testing methods when the goal is to select the most significant genes (not all the significant genes). When the goal is to select all the significant genes, the proposed methods perform equally well as the current multiple testing methods. Another advantage provided by the proposed methods is their ability to detect noisy data and therefore suggest no sensible selection can be made.","inCitations":["b4dd18040bdb7ceaa170e2b20d03037d9c4df17d","dd2d8bdf5c20acf90b5b127d4a48d6769944e216","711fd4282173909a6f101279b9bb222d37fdc929","2dbae0967cb9d6d0a137c5401294fb22fa1a1705","fb5ea58ad9331060fba9579e7283c0a5d910b086","742928f9fbd1c68d40f62978727a74ae02b0fd49"],"title":"Optimized ranking and selection methods for feature selection with application in microarray experiments.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903572720"}

In the creation and subsequent testing of the validity of an endpoint, it is desirable to show that on repeated measurements the endpoint can be measured precisely, and that it is reproducible with not only itself, but with any \"gold standard\" that can assess accuracy. Short of having this gold standard, we rely on showing that the endpoint is reliable. Agreement is the extent to which the measurement of the variable of interest yields the same results (consistency) on repeated trials. Thus the more consistent the results given by repeated measurements, the more reliable the measuring procedure. In this article, we examine the sensitivity to location and scale shift of different methods for assessing agreement. These tools include Pearson's correlation coefficient, the intraclass correlation coefficient, the concordance correlation coefficient, the Bradley-Blackwood procedure, and the within patient coefficient of variation. Our simulation studies showed that there are situations wherein the various methods for assessing agreement give conflicting results. On the basis of the results of the simulation studies, there are three important components to consider when deciding whether two sets of measurements are in agreement or not. The first component is the degree of linear relationship between the two sets; the second is the amount of bias as represented by the difference in the means; and the third is the difference between the two variances. The purpose of this article is to help interpret numerical results from the measures of agreement and to establish a criterion or range of values for each agreement measure that we consider to indicate agreement. We clarify what is meant by agreement by placing the measures in context based on scale and location shifts. Furthermore, we present guidelines for assessing agreement or endpoint validation when there are plans to design a clinical trial, and we give an actual example from a recent study.","inCitations":["ded2ac132be070d533b9728b41e4582765997092","0a55f99f387bba73c1dfcd1407ba3d21b154cf6f","093fa30612c3878d206c5031accbb183912e1c37","a7fd3f2f5c80fec0d7e88625360614014b3d1425","9fe4a053046cd24bd15a0e296c3abb71dc538d99","d70ec74423e0862d4b102c99b2efb33aeabb740c","32dcc6aae6ba4fa711131950d2cf2307a49c3e84","5ef70deb711faf651231a2d64fab3b30ae79aa44","46c43730fb12b91982bebd8ebc5fafd47075b743"],"title":"Guidelines for measurement validation in clinical trial design.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101185"}

The likelihood approach is one of the most popular estimation methods employed within the joint modeling framework. Typically, the parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood, with computation performed by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. However, one drawback of this approach is that standard error (SE) estimates are not automatically produced when using the EM algorithm. Many different procedures have been proposed to obtain the asymptotic covariance matrix for the parameters when the number of parameters is typically small. In the joint modeling context, however, there may be an infinite-dimensional parameter, the baseline hazard function, which greatly complicates the problem, so that the existing methods cannot be readily applied. The profile likelihood and the bootstrap methods overcome the difficulty to some extent; however, they can be computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose two new methods for SE estimation using the EM algorithm that allow for more efficient computation of the SE of a subset of parametric components in a semiparametric or high-dimensional parametric model. The precision and computation time are evaluated through a thorough simulation study. We conclude with an application of our SE estimation method to analyze an HIV clinical trial dataset.","inCitations":["f156dd9ede81ef958cd998a9dd9b6661527e69c8","10c806510614921113dfdb032fcd9528e2bfdf75","f55e0d5f56f9c50e3f1e3f5a577a8a4e8477c89a","2d26adfde88ceda0e93e96e836f3f38478b559f9","5206667b3e412a1b0f33621bb96cd0743964c178","cb94fcf7aa71a1300ed04f670cf8f6ba11e58d01","a668ae6dca762709cc0f51e49eaa001593363bba","0b8ee70b85a66d222ef603948c87dae2777f7431","5164c812864e72502fd813455ae82d53c716da3e"],"title":"Standard error estimation using the EM algorithm for the joint modeling of survival and longitudinal data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu015"}

PMI data present new challenges for statistical analysis mainly due to the structural dependence among peptides. A PMI is made of a complete library of consecutive peptides. They are synthesized by systematically shifting a window of a fixed number of amino acids through the finite sequence of amino acids of the antigen protein as ordered in the primary structure of the protein. This implies that consecutive peptides have a certain number of amino acids in common and hence are structurally dependent. We propose a new flexible Bayesian hierarchical model framework, which allows one to detect recognized peptides and bound epitope regions in a single framework, taking into account the structural dependence between peptides through a suitable latent Markov structure.

This quantity has many applications in practice. For instance, a reliable estimate of π(0) can eliminate the conservative bias of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure on controlling the false discovery rate. It is known that most methods in the literature for estimating π(0) are conservative. Recently, some attempts have been paid to reduce such estimation bias. Nevertheless, they are either over bias corrected or suffering from an unacceptably large estimation variance. In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating π(0) that aims to reduce the bias and variance of the estimation simultaneously. To achieve this, we first utilize the probability density functions of false-null p-values and then propose a novel algorithm to estimate the quantity of π(0). The statistical behavior of the proposed estimator is also investigated. Finally, we carry out extensive simulation studies and several real data analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimator. Both simulated and real data demonstrate that the proposed method may improve the existing literature significantly.","inCitations":["a5934f3ff638aefae996772f8e3daf35d4105ad5","1a466a88d4d01689c94aa507f4794f8ddba61983","b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c","c909efcc0011df8dfa69a30bfc0b0ead4bbb494d","71e8e17f265ee74c1f9b95c21ee7d6b5bd1a4791"],"title":"Bias and variance reduction in estimating the proportion of true-null hypotheses.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu029"}

However, those analyses might not provide robust inference when the normality assumptions are questionable if the data set particularly exhibits skewness and heavy tails. In this article, we develop a Bayesian approach to bivariate linear mixed-effects (BLME) models replacing the Gaussian assumptions for the random terms with skew-normal/independent (SNI) distributions. The SNI distribution is an attractive class of asymmetric heavy-tailed parametric structure which includes the skew-normal, skew-t, skew-slash, and skew-contaminated normal distributions as special cases. We assume that the random-effects and the within-subject (random) errors, respectively, follow multivariate SNI and normal/independent (NI) distributions, which provide an appealing robust alternative to the symmetric normal distribution in a BLME model framework. The method is exemplified through an application to an AIDS clinical data set to compare potential models with different distribution specifications, and clinically important findings are reported.","inCitations":["2b2683a6f800a74b63bf277a6c7f177cf8628a22","6e543849899b80564aa04ef8a2c283c70effa7a5","b77bb1c0808d445df655c1fb17122110807632b6","ca627a3a21cefcb911b47adba7d895264ae88ae8"],"title":"Bayesian bivariate linear mixed-effects models with skew-normal/independent distributions, with application to AIDS clinical studies.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.920660"}

Synthesizing data in one encompassing model allows propagation of evidence and learning. We demonstrate the use of such an approach in estimating the number of people infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in England and Wales. Data are obtained from seroprevalence studies conducted in different subpopulations. Each subpopulation is modeled as a composition of 3 main HCV risk groups (current injecting drug users (IDUs), ex-IDUs, and non-IDUs). Further, data obtained on the prevalence (size) of each risk group provide an estimate of the prevalence of HCV in the whole population. We simultaneously estimate all model parameters through the use of Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The main emphasis of this paper is the assessment of evidence consistency and investigation of the main drivers for model inferences. We consider a cross-validation technique to reveal data conflict and leverage when each data source is in turn removed from the model.","inCitations":["59ea78d7df49b0e630530032f82bb394b56e198e","2dbbb8a926c6d0a80883c7c7e845a95ef82a1d72","42d956a21c20ade3ccb8892e0c1e9451bb3c9c6f","e34a1ccc5689b45917004bf05ee6a89b1ed09ca3","269223d18dd6c22fd7bce659e83f56b685de1d8b","c1c5bba1de04e2e5ef9c062ab41ae2fed78c15f0","118abc42636040ea240d4285d482e49a4544fa6c","dcd24fa654566597debfb500d262410704ed802c","7a006ac2cbb907180cecb4e1af9717dd6d694336","aeae393ff8cecc827d70b312164936a82224fc81","05fe15bfb4325a59be3a9bdcd70e2539179d8649","ee08dce4d2afecc233c53c14b8174aa5c3b24f1c","f6ca18e85a1d62e1d563997bcc7bc30cedeba1d6","183a80621fdfe5669c7d5af5e7a7a0a23734731a","b76f21ee96107d5975e07180e61e90c5efd39c2c","24ce7c5dc5620abc89081c95f698dc8744123ea5","4f203fcebdc59903ba0148a0722113fc899244c9","0801713b34f4774e146ceb843f1c7647b5032d89","53c51428785c71be9acf5ad6590729ff54d0aa05","3b61307b9c2ef55910dcbffbb4210a253bbce023","04305810516a3f5a6426ef765b14b4fbf67b916e","fd3d04ae49f8f23e4786f71cf145e4edb8a2b678","e6e3a207ebba987fce5f6d2a17052100884f5b4a","2649917f228959e008cb3c9a2d4825622baff1d9","81e11bf3364390b4d4a0de021da9339b21a82f72","64eecc0db88a7bc910ac57be07191744c8503fa4","ad02dfffcbe30856990d6b3ddadcfb7227812e6b","e4c619b8912a5df00a8a95778ec275c12a9320f5","ce95e2a932a8e9d5a8aafa5f0e42e63c21d49e4a","aeb30abb987677d87ba5e7129261eee03d9fb800","a89c5d10d782072a45d3b1d95e08ab0cd2fa9d39"],"title":"Estimating hepatitis C prevalence in England and Wales by synthesizing evidence from multiple data sources.

Thus estimation of parameters of a nonlinear regression model is an important problem. The estimates of the parameters and their uncertainty estimates depend upon the underlying error variance structure in the model. Typically, a priori the researcher would know if the error variances are homoscedastic (i.e., constant across dose) or if they are heteroscedastic (i.e., the variance is a function of dose). Motivated by this concern, in this article we introduce an estimation procedure based on preliminary test which selects an appropriate estimation procedure accounting for the underlying error variance structure. Since outliers and influential observations are common in toxicological data, the proposed methodology uses M-estimators. The asymptotic properties of the preliminary test estimator are investigated; in particular its asymptotic covariance matrix is derived. The performance of the proposed estimator is compared with several standard estimators using simulation studies. The proposed methodology is also illustrated using a data set obtained from the National Toxicology Program.","inCitations":["00b97d5e66436f700b909439a7ffefbe22c630b8","f8eb6f861b2b9ebf8675476096795d97a2c063ce","f08c67e73c1f1ba17e4b880acecdfea47ee2ac88","c5c272dc5c5fd071d1da844863241b73d4178f4b","d4dfff59ccc101345da8fe76abb7534232c0a80d"],"title":"Accounting for Uncertainty in Heteroscedasticity in Nonlinear Regression.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2011.11.003"}

It is not uncommon to encounter count data that exhibit overdispersion where the Poisson model is no longer appropriate. This paper deals with methods for overdispersed data using the negative binomial distribution resulting from a Poisson-Gamma mixture. We investigate the small sample properties of the likelihood-based tests and compare their performances to those of the t-test and of the Wilcoxon test. We also illustrate how these procedures may be used to compute power and sample sizes to design studies with response variables that are overdispersed count data. Although methods are based on inferences about two independent samples, sample size calculations may also be applied to problems comparing more than two independent samples. It will be shown that there is gain in efficiency when using the likelihood-based methods compared to the t-test and the ilcoxon test. In studies where each observation is very costly, the ability to derive smaller sample size estimates with the appropriate tests is not only statistically, but also financially, appealing.","inCitations":["fcbe187b6bb00b592b5080d17084592eb7a86fb9","de377f87f114812ea9fbfa9b1c5e790506f3f08f","a08962e6156e8ab183ddd1ee41c7e37bbbffce15","0cbc40881b3273dc3c32911a8475d93142b69ddc","975f4e1c1eff0bffff8cd5e0e8afaa8a46069273","394c9593f7312d6bd621a1daa3fa374878f39c70","6a2b335c6edc9f7484e51dba95d20d2e765feede","628398e6fb872425c5b4802f1cbba83cdcfa26ec","d159b6448859c9cbc57f54241f57c449b56d6e2c","86435799b52242a34783c947edf33baa50407b7c","bbe4a409ece46030a995148d275bbdc129be09a3","ce31b0bac62a6bb2b5975d07c6b3b1ea17f3eb25","709acbb7b2a0af7a4681fdc932efd06b41b72b0e","0c621456fdec4aa6e0f01d24d560143344daa824","4969dd060a90e8e71f1f7283c3dad1966ed35f7a","e6a5e8a0fdefb51a552b6c73d8615a61638bc4e1","72d4a864927ba83f2899575846f298b53480717a","7215bcad56146e60c07fc870fb0e78844a01783e","8072deb6718a5535045f548ae49ce2a7347a051f","9cdae0567d11619811482cecfd27f4e61c974d89","3b6e2f38258eca1d096603f941f0c7e4698ba1dd","ef5f31dfba1fc2f91f3de1f29a466164533c3754","51d304b3d20bbfb89275803655495666b70d55e3","0365a53442aa3b17f40c01f4aa7ac06f2454e1b3","8d02681eabad97570e852c94e7ddf583248cb958","9fda9dd876bbc2c84faf6801155f8aa0b649bd0b","75b396411b349462e6bd56ee4612dda2a29e75f2","1cc439940abd79014db89ffed777bc79c29f2bf8","6eb65d78c989ec7b89430b20a25d046e531b4d43","34278bc498e7c543ca073f0636332a9564d34434","326a588566559606b63f8a2a6680d891beec5e05","7fc1b31ef2523fcfcfa7e109337502aaebdcd568","ee6ac3eab16d430ef85dd2e23da2b1fbd8ba4f17","1f6685af82d5054fd77e54d40fe2c031c8de8aa0","f4bf014cbff4e6593e1c2feca7b277b4607a5083","078cd0344058e589192bcc14d1960a22c1f5ea5c","bb133ef5eb96c2e63f52fd5cb04b0b2596dbed1b","f6b88f14deb4c8e531f125e96017fc3a56cb3041"],"title":"Inferences and power analysis concerning two negative binomial distributions with an application to MRI lesion counts data","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.07.034"}

They accommodate such heterogeneity by the inclusion of a random term, the frailty, which is assumed to multiply the hazard of a subject (individual frailty) or the hazards of all subjects in a cluster (shared frailty). Typically, the frailty term is assumed to be constant over time. This is a restrictive assumption and extensions to allow for time-varying or dynamic frailties are of interest. In this paper, we extend the auto-correlated frailty models of Henderson and Shimakura and of Fiocco, Putter and van Houwelingen, developed for longitudinal count data and discrete survival data, to continuous survival data. We present a rigorous construction of the frailty processes in continuous time based on compound birth-death processes. When the frailty processes are used as mixtures in models for survival data, we derive the marginal hazards and survival functions and the marginal bivariate survival functions and cross-ratio function. We derive distributional properties of the processes, conditional on observed data, and show how to obtain the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the model using a (stochastic) expectation-maximization algorithm. The methods are applied to a publicly available data set.","inCitations":["b90831a77fd5d2089842f346aece798b091904f0","86335a1ef0a072d32e0730060bc202cf97695e1d","40ab99e81717f48346d0641756831b074185112f","b56eedcb578f2a19e8507edbf428e8c5f3c8128d","d383dee1af9dd90760d0707913762abbd67106ea","fac19b5e06482f8af555d70c1529ad2004df4c3f","b54f5220e7dbbf4aebab79f089aa3afdb2dfebb5","4e25e29b3f7c59f46b1b76264bd70cb42ffd0548","9e1d8b5c0696df97d645a4c53bcf56a47c89891f"],"title":"Dynamic frailty models based on compound birth-death processes.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv002"}

This article investigates a new censoring scheme, namely, Type II progressive interval censoring with random removals to cope with the setting that patients are examined at fixed regular intervals and dropouts may occur during the study period. We discuss the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters and derive the corresponding asymptotic variances when survival times are assumed to be Weibull distributed. An example is discussed to illustrate the application of the results under this censoring scheme.","inCitations":["4523bbc31af7147ea4490426feca698581cf1315","4342184bbbe1d6ec99e01b2eae19ee5d5b0d3a38","9f04d1c29d2a77bbc0c61e666c350726e8919e22","8f5d6d06bdcfa43f61685547a8220565e0c55111","112ebe11fc80c1a5942c5d236048684f9f484a64","38588f574a7b7b348d9049ef759b636d30d98826"],"title":"Maximum likelihood estimation in survival studies under progressive interval censoring with random removals.","doi":"10.1080/10543400500266643"}
