This article takes the alternative standpoint that the ordering can be tuned to sharpen the approximations. Indeed, the first part of the paper includes a systematic study of how ordering affects the accuracy of Vecchia's approximation. We demonstrate the surprising result that random orderings can give dramatically sharper approximations than default coordinate-based orderings. Additional ordering schemes are described and analyzed numerically, including orderings capable of improving on random orderings. The second contribution of this paper is a new automatic method for grouping calculations of components of the approximation. The grouping methods simultaneously improve approximation accuracy and reduce computational burden. In common settings, reordering combined with grouping reduces Kullback-Leibler divergence from the target model by more than a factor of 60 compared to ungrouped approximations with default ordering. The claims are supported by theory and numerical results with comparisons to other approximations, including tapered covariances and stochastic partial differential equations. Computational details are provided, including the use of the approximations for prediction and conditional simulation. An application to space-time satellite data is presented.","inCitations":["9c02bb6328cfaacaf88b5682100d6ca2e65a885a","e48ee0d95b34aa8ce158bdd84f80d671351268e5","af8ac27e34e2d85f2cb8439edb50547a42c76593","f7a06cbe8bae9acd7453c48f3d609d719f0d54da","fb6fd253fefe997baf411b689e0713e522785213","558d7a8790c68caf818fc5511c4e48d6ff73d2ef","1113972f05e299e680547fbfe370c0217753f6b8","bbdba4df0c6a538a29088953b8d3347a72c76f90","d20a2ac9dd305318b4bb8da98525ebd8856f29bc","4a50d428ab9fa2194e8ca78031c9620d00525e93","e89af1f422769b211b963132a9bcd0c804b4f506","f62da4f3161681c311dc3a83038573d3549b941e","1b327dd7c5382fbc254157b471d28fba6e1aef2d","83615636f44997b96f92ffe0f71f2a7e022949b6","76e8de9074c1abc563034761e108648b0f0e9de2","c6af9905d8cb350becfd02ab8efcbcd52ec36c47","c6d04b892927a10a777aba0c4e1b3b991c1e70e7"],"title":"Permutation and Grouping Methods for Sharpening Gaussian Process Approximations","doi":"10.1080/00401706.2018.1437476"}

By having these effects represented in the model by unknown parameters, and by imposing a shrinkage prior distribution that assumes an unspecified subset of the effects to be zero, we obtain a proper posterior distribution for the causal effect of interest. This posterior can be sampled via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods of inference to obtain point and interval estimates. The model priors require a minimal input from the user. We explore the performance of our method by means of a simulation experiment. Our results show that the method is reasonably robust to the presence of directional pleiotropy and moderate correlation between the instruments. One section of the article elaborates the model to deal with two exposures, and illustrates the possibility of using MR to estimate direct and indirect effects in this situation. A main objective of the article is to create a basis for developments in MR that exploit the potential offered by a Bayesian approach to the problem, in relation with the possibility of incorporating external information in the prior, handling multiple sources of uncertainty, and flexibly elaborating the basic model.","inCitations":["8526e319fa99a945e44af158e4db445d8366f3c7","6ecdf6ad2160fc3965d6ccacc67b916e7078c8dc","481a3c97f81199560ca5a9fd37514f9b85f4afe3","c649ea28e939e091ab07f3fb85fefab15823e72e","397cf573b6a768235c93ffdb5610e762ca12ff07"],"title":"A Bayesian approach to Mendelian randomization with multiple pleiotropic variants","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy027"}

The usual estimators of these quantities are unbiased if data on the diagnostic test result and the true disease status are obtained from all subjects in an appropriately selected sample. In some studies, verification of the true disease status is performed only for a subset of subjects, possibly depending on the result of the diagnostic test and other characteristics of the subjects. Estimators of sensitivity and specificity based on this subset of subjects are typically biased; this is known as verification bias. Methods have been proposed to correct verification bias under the assumption that the missing data on disease status are missing at random (MAR), that is, the probability of missingness depends on the true (missing) disease status only through the test result and observed covariate information. When some of the covariates are continuous, or the number of covariates is relatively large, the existing methods require parametric models for the probability of disease or the probability of verification (given the test result and covariates), and hence are subject to model misspecification. We propose a new method for correcting verification bias based on the propensity score, defined as the predicted probability of verification given the test result and observed covariates. This is estimated separately for those with positive and negative test results. The new method classifies the verified sample into several subsamples that have homogeneous propensity scores and allows correction for verification bias. Simulation studies demonstrate that the new estimators are more robust to model misspecification than existing methods, but still perform well when the models for the probability of disease and probability of verification are correctly specified.","inCitations":["b05827caacd8a991fe98abed030a6b3114b7aa86","cdae74ae389a50f841e5483261d8618722934653","a1e4e50ce3307a7f8b94890a0e11dfbd9f04e5ce","7f98db11057c7840e13b3c722aa4012832de7c0b","b2b4551c051fd5e4d784052d7945a141ec006c64","d650a22048bc0ab188af2601867ee412696d089b","3a5cc6ff44df63c51d4fad84095463afc5a327e7","4bdbd68916ba438a8d112dce3a284b282483814b","ea04a33f3e4fa013f7124312a01688343332c486","1aeb6fb9ce9d3aefc6836f42d741c701741ea798","2263665fffc3b1460b5d6ab73611109e801eaf5f"],"title":"A robust method using propensity score stratification for correcting verification bias for binary tests.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr020"}

In this paper, we consider the multivariate failure times regression analysis in which the primary covariate is assessed only in a validation set but a continuous auxiliary covariate for it is available for all subjects in the study cohort. Under the frame of marginal hazard model, we propose to estimate the induced relative risk function in the nonvalidation set through kernel smoothing method and then obtain an estimated pseudo-partial likelihood function. The proposed estimated pseudo-partial likelihood estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. We also give an estimator of the marginal cumulative baseline hazard function.

in applied mathematics and statistics","paperAbstract":"Any movement performed repeatedly will be executed with inter-trial variability. Oropharyngeal swallowing is a complex sensorimotor action, and swallow-to-swallow variability can have consequences that impact swallowing safety. Our aim was to determine an appropriate method to measure swallowing pressure waveform variability. An ideal variability metric must be sensitive to known deviations in waveform amplitude, duration, and overall shape, without being biased by waveforms that have both positive and sub-atmospheric pressure profiles. Through systematic analysis of model waveforms, we found a coefficient of variability (CV) parameter on waveforms adjusted such that the overall mean was 0 to be best suited for swallowing pressure variability analysis. We then investigated pharyngeal swallowing pressure variability using high-resolution manometry data from healthy individuals to assess impacts of waveform alignment, pharyngeal region, and number of swallows investigated. The alignment that resulted in the lowest overall swallowing pressure variability was when the superior-most sensor in the upper esophageal sphincter reached half its maximum pressure. Pressures in the tongue base region of the pharynx were least variable and pressures in the hypopharynx region were most variable. Sets of 3 - 10 consecutive swallows had no overall difference in variability, but sets of 2 swallows resulted in significantly less variability than the other dataset sizes. This study identified variability in swallowing pressure waveform shape throughout the pharynx in healthy adults; we discuss implications for swallowing motor control.","inCitations":["34e49d35839aaeecd4d3f6f245482484b56be53d","44d701360189be38bb123266bada5881b66c0dbd"],"title":"Methods for Measuring Swallowing Pressure Variability Using High-Resolution Manometry","doi":"10.3389/fams.2018.00023"}

However, logistic regression results based on a poorly designed experiment can be seriously compromised. Our results indicate that depending on the spacing of the doses, the number of doses, and the number of replications at each dose, the user can get very misleading results, including ineffective lack-of-fit tests and severely biased coefficient estimates along with biased estimates of response. In addition, variance formulas based on asymptotic theory may be completely inappropriate. Simulation results are used to support these statements.","inCitations":["598fc8325980de550e68d5b67b81870e747b0c86","680f7446e75a39ef14a70ce49652d56f02c30051"],"title":"A note on the small sample behavior of logistic regression in a bioassay setting.","doi":"10.1080/10543409808835260"}

We examine alternative strategies for dealing with non-normal data, particularly when the sample size is small. In two simulation studies, we systematically varied: the degree of non-normality; the sample size from 50 to 1000; the way of indicator formation, comparing items versus parcels; the parcelling strategy, evaluating uniformly positively skews and kurtosis parcels versus those with counterbalancing skews and kurtosis; and the estimation procedure, contrasting maximum likelihood and asymptotically distribution-free methods. We evaluated the convergence behaviour of solutions, as well as the systematic bias and variability of parameter estimates, and goodness of fit.","inCitations":["7221af196960fd93062555a80645767b9e4490ee","241698b7cedc6eeba4520eb07be11be99bb8334b","c8406630732d78e7d5044090db573c31d3e1ecbc","86cb9d53c782d73006c1b7379cd977d7c9e4c94b","4ca4a99d4d7488442f9b36f7a62fbd71ca3321dd","f3e84b1f36617a2f393041f934795b1c3ab4e348","eaf9641d0d136310f2a980cfc28c79e4542f1c83","e496d7cba545bda7ed2c62386a601276d1b44aaf","63e6fbbe8ec5c27ad55906fddd0730ae7a363ebc","43d22277998520d8db8ec43175a4825310b6095d","acac5187fd1a018abd690555a7b497b9260c9842","453308ce54f57e01ce5a2683804978416b7e005e","57de91395eea245f499192315380bcd2db970653","4c931cf5482272a7d97e5d635cd8bfb6e4883511","1e1f5a169ea1c24250871d5807bcc000cff262ee","198f1bf41fe47a91300c6ba0e91d00a85b2648e5","18b962e3a0d0f13122c4ca12c0fbb8dcde4b2b38","ad83cc1f5048e4bdebc63ed5d90d50bc91db8fa2","8f950a74eb26e328fa55eb7ddcc655ccad45685c","ff7a0e21f829a821944c59512082e09a4ebe520f","e7db2188a84c7fc849deda16aceb5db34e11dea2","0508c5fa2373bd31a644eeb1ffd5ad825338a6f9","a35b300cd41b9ef73e33ef62f86b3d8fbddcf0a3","2f16ec48902fb24175cd83631dbcad02acd2e133","c19997e43637b36f51afef8a6f93c518cdbd355e","cf8b9284169d8c3310386d2d0a2e25c875d5e18a","f64d64ecabb9e0f35847dde03dfd2851b5c94d9d","4749c0749745b286482d4e7bd79643d0833ce4ec","7dfd9a8af7dfdda0eaaf449c67d8d857f172ade5","bc9ae8ddaacdb3c1ca38bf2576f8c49315733171","1cdd4ca38516c5c1a4f7d6f8adfe55116be28b39","4641312235de86172f398aeef7c68eb56bf180ff","d17cfc2e3ed951178a6de6934d351791948760b0","009d2b532c8e5dcbc080c5b3dc5ce555e8c22ac1","12fa6478c3b763434d2c81f97f32bde71b0e3d7d","cc842bd5692e28b1ee496c1d694825e75129fff5","9ca68431519d574d7ac16b1075608f6e18b7b317","5b013734e0c5c5426b59345c93c9f1184066cdfd","591be1fa6d18df300ed6b7a993c6214598407398","100e68e78eef88b926b65ab0d676a7b43f1d9471","d43b8a52dc32c1586426eb23812d01b5b80bf426","580423eedac2778a9025bced7acfe3fb4df2cfc7","e2b884fbcadc9f1ebfe8f1dd4ac67fc0dcaa6aa2","c25fe3083b8f422923d5582b1ebfae3aaa2fd6df","2ac6c745487e22d7c1d6eb23eed9fea0bd75f809","3c3fcec412a781c87ab6c923deceaa6c456ade55","d7236b03f808fe842c9bd850181215351957aaa3","b637eb4df7b7233dc870d099df7930693da75284","8944a42787bc02655650dee2964fe20039ddd0cd","27e6bbfb969563ace7701bd3f87bf94a6b4bac99","2e81ced1c3fa9a36023122f98d6835db5efa962d","5ae7e0d702904b0cdec97f4ef08fdb4f22086e01","e15b9be06b6eec96769fde28659532b8bb411472","d011efc35d8ac232ff84d0b5340ac5c19358c313","d97f69d2ffdae37dfe91c725e045c8289d51e2f6","a0be92cdd045653fe5ce8f8c0c81189765425d00","b1f9dad47a52380e91e4797d48ade522fb31b9c4","12ed66c0a8dab9c9802559d3b33a8b67b6b4cbb5","de6520948f647f1bd408aecd8663f29ff0d7de9b","7d0ac860ff84624b1683c6169a18f03fd0ac8ae3","039a2c25252d2d536375908d9a3392d83028a50e","0bf7e931a591d1d0ac9adbcae07c444a7a02f17f","eb1a6403f865f7476b8c0d91c92b38e42a05ee16","14970fecec1d6079a36e01ae8ea05e94ffb7bd1f","8cd7cf347d410a43a2e59fa71b845e45be210d3a","bfeec479adfd86d4335a6b884e8367df6d4d9279","d48b30f5df5adb4ed0771bffcca030633203b089","3f88092738ae4c78f535c3405b1cc0c2893a1a82","ce01a1ddb00967e19b767539119d198204fb0cf7","535733a67c1fdd9a44866538175ef6f6444099b9","980edfcecf180a1798751c84199f5a4e9dc2d78f","f6bf3261708664f8a015be6ac9fec256b8fa6dd7","bb74ebd4a124747b2a4cb43e4ad0aaf1216acf25","cbb2ad0583636aa7bcef08533113087f37d15868","c4a58dda2f5504b4ea72955543f4fc177666385c","52f378286cc29462961b1722ca95fcd96c8974e4","38eec2a556084cb82f83f603f68e593d6ef88897","06bad04d9615ae23015b9f770b25338d32330e7f","d45d5014a7c6ece3f92728dbf714663a120911cb","5c1fb1e113595d6f60870d5f8f55039ea7da2266","7f3304f7fc1ba0c29fdee70fb83b0b78451a5f2f","2e08b53e997013730e3db20e0448395a583b8d51","274739bd7225df7855ab725bc449548dbb486b09","626915a7888ea0593c39d9222a2ced83d4e8ed13","a52307837aaa0d4350dc82b78f68a75cb3ad1972","a293775eabab78212afa358be2cfc1a3f9413236","b803b358737a6861ec54a8937b0f8004c44b45be","b74eae4c2f13a3c17452248fc5af65b92add2c06","6cf858f3e8ba6bbe58db80feb29877684be9ddd6","2e4dcd48508d365b81a6b04c9810a5b1e591414f","47a37fc73b7b34fb0653fed343b0acb77db7d83c","8caf9f0eb43505de4acaa9fd0b9ad9fb24b58ba4","c560306af59054d44835147403daec4ecccd9664","300283d382f6874d25bdfdd8d83f4927d37de22b","2bada559e877f54b82d51a9a150b576f881e3230","07aa0b57f4fa0556aa0137c246789ae38bf508c0","1b8ed179e9aad12f24491f19da6605da1b479cba","b775c1a249c25dfb8b825af689239b8c78b2c7f4","30c665806df35f5b1e7396215d7ddfe31c186649","355aa63ad83f586a95d55b38a68bee81acca0b43","c09612f9087926899394b5bcdd805242dc9ffe9e","d2ee48174077076ad3b7ccb59bcc68bb24934f77","983dd50e1d5b1d8d3a796047c565bdebac524e37","d7473194433e330c8aa12140264812cff2169a1b","12763526b5cf66138af109a80e50871f0de03359","24142aff410aad1ef7aa52f73386e45e3269a46c","c2961be9e5fdd3464341bd7b626d82e825dbc951","1bac08fbde36f7c7c1d5915b83d00bb1ac579dbd","22ce085bac4d489b378e00eea4d85a04aed65d5a","70a44cf087b62389db196ab907352520ea33c98c","d16b5872d27b9d118fb6bdbe232b2b4bb1630813","4ad9c6daade3382f5eb3b598cd8bb69b4422e89a","4c0ee336d28df50aa72546ff0504d6f81174dbfc","6b68236cecdd1995de199f9204547609c4f6c783","2a7a3baf35a033204bf0b9a180b2d2a25ac9e3fa","8d7168be00e28210f16147c61ac1bb96c

The original studies indicated that this intervention successfully increased duration of breastfeeding and lowered rates of gastrointestinal tract infections in newborns. Additional scientific and popular interest lies in determining the causal effect of longer breastfeeding on gastrointestinal infection. In this study, we estimate the expected infection count under various lengths of breastfeeding in order to estimate the effect of breastfeeding duration on infection. Due to the presence of baseline and time-dependent confounding, specialized \"causal\" estimation methods are required. We demonstrate the double-robust method of Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) in the context of this application and review some related methods and the adjustments required to account for clustering. We compare TMLE (implemented both parametrically and using a data-adaptive algorithm) to other causal methods for this example. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to determine (1) the effectiveness of controlling for clustering indicators when cluster-specific confounders are unmeasured and (2) the importance of using data-adaptive TMLE.","inCitations":["aa599afe923abd5817a3c61a844cfbda49ca2b37","ee5a3b983fe66c48542ffcfdea733d8222e486c1","4ab69b616cfb86f17dc268570a844286739185c1","39dbd37d8c9cbefdf4989d05e18d5847319ae05e","b4d7ecac98fb93e2f869f1ce3bfb091aaaf05257","6b5edd28807435569766119e21ed1607a37e7652","b2025554a2d323be36a8e405d079c53a26516eb7","56c27592ccbbdea7d3670c37ccb890841ca60dff","949e42a52d0c5ed9adc58a2e83f9de484e2b36ad","ef24698e6b0b7e967b0dc3c1367a4842407af988","b0b2c40e5689c5e0f6cf234d2ad48c6151da2efc","41ec6a911fa664764b765fdc315be5e35c446fb9","1f93177657a04077f725de82d168cf7caebbc9f4","0f5e07f56d427794e050bf7110b478fa992a4b85","c275b73d4ef6f383b606a451aed5b6d6a540c571","6e94be6f245da1547ff3f852e0d435dbd17a2a42","1dc23732b894045439682a4cdf29e585c2eab7a8","7d416d8b6201af8c06e05aa74f7a4ea5f4cdba83","1aee87b6b8962bd1673833cd84446118d5fb6caf","ae080f86fed62acc0f68dec92e9d33ac442005de","f410a02773766057e8981eff5719f07dac7e74b9"],"title":"Effect of Breastfeeding on Gastrointestinal Infection in Infants: a Targeted Maximum Likelihood Approach for Clustered Longitudinal Data.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS727"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2014,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Clinical trials in the context of comparative effectiveness research (CER) are often conducted to evaluate health outcomes under real-world conditions and standard health care settings. In such settings, three-level hierarchical study designs are increasingly common. For example, patients may be nested within treating physicians, who in turn are nested within an urgent care center or hospital. While many trials randomize the third-level units (e.g., centers) to intervention, in some cases randomization may occur at lower levels of the hierarchy, such as patients or physicians. In this article, we present and verify explicit closed-form sample size and power formulas for three-level designs assuming randomization is at the first or second level. The formulas are based on maximum likelihood estimates from mixed-effect linear models and verified by simulation studies. Results indicate that even with smaller sample sizes, theoretical power derived with known variances is nearly identical to empirically estimated power for the more realistic setting when variances are unknown. In addition, we show that randomization at the second or first level of the hierarchy provides an increasingly statistically efficient alternative to third-level randomization. Power to detect a treatment effect under second-level randomization approaches that of patient-level randomization when there are few patients within each randomized second-level cluster and, most importantly, when the correlation attributable to second-level variation is a small proportion of the overall correlation between patient outcomes.","inCitations":["b8137a58732bed2d3f8d5a4ce4fede6b73084625","a1e8783c7289e2d5f0cdd5bc3c33bcf2d1707f7f","679567d494cfc4ac244fd89e31226566de374465","675838a080cd479005893d4f497bafcebaa90ed8","9c39825af4e65d7c63de3c48f612f456e39c472d","3f758b30211e0412a359f067edec207cca6d5664"],"title":"Sample size determination for three-level randomized clinical trials with randomization at the first or second level.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.888436"}

Bayesian approaches are particularly well-suited to this task, with their natural ability to borrow strength across data sources. In this paper, we propose an eMAP approach for incorporating historical data into the analysis of clinical studies, and we discuss an application of this method to the analysis of observational safety studies for a class of products for patients with hemophilia A. The eMAP prior approach is flexible and robust to prior-data conflict. We conducted simulations to compare the frequentist operating characteristics of three approaches under different prior-data conflict assumptions and sample size scenarios.","inCitations":["0f52f59865c6572e24e5905c842b30eeca0db6c4","a898acc2de378fb47650c7793361c919f1765c6b"],"title":"Addressing prior-data conflict with empirical meta-analytic-predictive priors in clinical studies with historical information.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1226324"}

There are inherent biases in microarray data generated from an experiment. Various statistical methods have been proposed for data normalization and data analysis. This paper proposes a generalized additive model for the analysis of gene expression data. This model consists of two sub-models: a non-linear model and a linear model. We propose a two-step normalization algorithm to fit the two sub-models sequentially. The first step involves a non-parametric regression using lowess fits to adjust for non-linear systematic biases. The second step uses a linear ANOVA model to estimate the remaining effects including the interaction effect of genes and treatments, the effect of interest in a study. The proposed model is a generalization of the ANOVA model for microarray data analysis. We show correspondences between the lowess fit and the ANOVA model methods. The normalization procedure does not assume the majority of genes do not change their expression levels, and neither does it assume two channel intensities from the same spot are independent. The procedure can be applied to either one channel or two channel data from the experiments with multiple treatments or multiple nuisance factors. Two toxicogenomic experiment data sets and a simulated data set are used to contrast the proposed method with the commonly known lowess fit and ANOVA methods.","inCitations":["f8b01a935c3776dc6776f20df4e1b189c4ef5580","6abaeb0b56d36d7203a3ef1f54afebadd03d8a2e","684e25e5dabbb979a5aa1c082a461fc45741ea78","ddaf6284223414a2604c141c3d22c7d322f001fb","b0c17ca165d0ded113a4f2f6f5a4c2511fac850e"],"title":"A generalized additive model for microarray gene expression data analysis.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200025648"}

Goodness of fit is customarily tested with recourse to the asymptotic approximation to the distribution of the statistics. An assessment of the quality of this approximation requires a comparison with the exact distribution, but how to compute this exact distribution when parameters are estimated from the data appears never to have been defined precisely. The main goal of this paper is to compare two different approaches to defining this exact distribution. One of the approaches uses the marginal distribution and is, therefore, independent of the data; the other approach uses the conditional distribution of the statistics given the estimated parameters and, therefore, is data-dependent. We carried out a thorough study involving various parameter estimation methods and goodness-of-fit statistics, all of them members of the general class of power-divergence measures. Included in the study were multinomial models with three to five cells and up to three parameters. Our results indicate that the asymptotic distribution is rarely a good approximation to the exact marginal distribution of the statistics, whereas it is a good approximation to the exact conditional distribution only when the vector of expected frequencies is interior to the sample space of the multinomial distribution.","inCitations":["0daea23ba66e7d909d6204ef240a5d250ae2b8a8"],"title":"On the chi-square approximation to the exact distribution of goodness-of-fit statistics in multinomial models with composite hypotheses.","doi":"10.1348/000711004849240"}

Components of the gains known to the agents and acted on by them may not be known by the observing economist. Such models are called correlated random coe cient models. Sorting on unobserved components of gains complicates the interpretation of what IV estimates. This paper examines testable implications of the hypothesis that agents do not sort into treatment based on gains. In it, we develop new tests to gauge the empirical relevance of the correlated random coe cient model to examine whether the additional complications associated with it are required. We examine the power of the proposed tests. We derive a new representation of the variance of the instrumental variable estimator for the correlated random coefficient model. We apply the methods in this paper to the prototypical empirical problem of estimating the return to schooling and nd evidence of sorting into schooling based on unobserved components of gains.","inCitations":["c8976e7d4a95081236d39bd0c3a505a60946efa3","5c6e10d4b25be8c9d0f0928e07304fe5d90c9103","c0886c74a1fd53cff980764a4f3ac717f755fd7e","09328030d638aa724d30c031114202e2b3ef5990","2eaf454a5e10dd6908d36ee094ff2f2ea4042f62","239087f229df6bbf39545442a85c8df8df3495df","389834c6f1f661f9978e2eab70e14c6652dace97","83cf90eab82af9fbeb6fc7449116a6494cdd3c86","aef4b0269b7fc9f8aee8e8791a29fd89e8a973ca","c6f0bffefe0fe0837e95d398383a42eaaecdcbea","3498db721ad3b460c0077b1463e1d6a403ec4599","626cfd10a0737162a74aaebde27684058937880f","892514ed50593fec0205ab824147b8225cb66c12","27d6fd3ee3cf7edc95030a0298fce577b191136a","42cb54ee1510419524d758fc768fe640e6774aed","67ae9eb6fbe9193e419b506185f0cedb45ea8261","8799773fe636f2f017a0dd3b07b41be895ad31ce","ca19a1813cb336f5d444992fb4943ee4b2af19e3","019e41f89e37bce30db09c34a37596e1b7ba7ce6","8baf103a4e82c36bc3fa5468d75190987b0d8baa","fafb09c7252e1c7f3c06a80ad86878a99edbe676","d38cdeb33ba44d9ef2f8798bfeb90b3b5703ef2e","5cfae6131ed1fcc0ef3c74822ef09d0f111b29f3","2cff08b0a5c36629c45d84daaebbdb21a249c9e8","a3dc3aacce64686a071814630741aae8a1dbc340","0e358018f12f05d29fab45cc1e7a45070e6df5e4","dea03f7c50aef7d7e88607564a11c8166e09c4e7","4a7a83cb9d265762cce102589e629ad3bffe56bc","c99bded7993b26f2d04eaaf86a206ade9a109aa6","d3c316aa007c86162cbcbb77311ec9cd479539bb","440118a5e921473567d40106c626fe9dcf72011b","fb58cd4632776aa7ba817f07cb0cace55175f885","9440ff945e9e84f56b23d9ba73d15c24481ea979","5480e3e62828409292a3d2fb1eafa7d2fc1b68b8","e728aca967979b991032359528c4ce9caae2261f","088d47f585da5a40cb12ab2969516614edcd75d6","8d8b11e5776d2710039535cbde4571063370ba5e","22846d2ce472779ba792a182011a63c4ff0720c7","02d413bc058368cd70743ea097967e4a38d1e66b","6844ab22290dca6f309ab487c6cc6ec679141d6b","80b0d613d868f6742b758a5487a40bb5631b0167","eba7b2e47aaced05c796572fe68ad0b1efbb9de9","b14d2e00f8a6401100b2e8adb75e04644e070aec","eb1ffc66e2cd6cef325f9d9afb9d66537d75ddae","f9899c04ce35b0b624f26d0b4d24068e7fd1101e","1f17c5172e49bd8c953e02b207fc33f7f3c3acbf","d4612cdfd5a808e1dc04a4f69507c7c5bb765897","bae655047b0d5dbddcf9c523730e5316df6e81d3"],"title":"Testing the Correlated Random Coefficient Model.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2010.01.005"}

An extension of the Time‐to‐Event Continual Reassessment Method (TITE‐CRM) which allows for the specification of toxicity constraints on both DLT and moderate toxicities, and can account for partial information is proposed. The method is illustrated in the context of an Erlotinib dose‐finding trial with low DLT rates, but a significant number of moderate toxicities leading to treatment discontinuation in later cycles. Based on simulations, our method performs well at selecting the dose level that satisfies both the DLT and moderate‐toxicity constraints. Moreover, it has similar probability of correct selection compared to the TITE‐CRM when the true MTD based on DLT only and the true MTD based on grade 2 or higher toxicities alone coincide, but reduces the probability of recommending a dose above the MTD.","inCitations":["18b1e1048967b301c18de3734acb99169f1195e5","1ba6db3f4d87cf1f80801578c64faa6fb760c6b9"],"title":"Dose-finding designs for cumulative toxicities using multiple constraints","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx059"}

The model employs a three-parameter family of survival distributions that includes the Weibull, negative binomial, and log-logistic distributions as special cases, and can be applied to data with left, right, interval, or non-censored event times. Standard methods, such as Newton-Raphson, can be employed to estimate the model and the resulting estimates have an asymptotically normal distribution about the true values with a covariance matrix that is consistently estimated by the information function. The deviance function is described to assess model fit and a robust sandwich estimate of the covariance may also be employed to provide asymptotically robust inferences when the model assumptions do not apply. Spline functions may also be employed to allow for non-linear covariates. The model is applied to data from a long-term study of type 1 diabetes to describe the effects of longitudinal measures of glycemia (HbA1c) over time (the time-dependent covariate) on the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy (eye disease), an interval-censored event-time outcome.","inCitations":["50752b4e74c3f6f9f7d66640500c28bc19a2f222","c9d3786c31301c7552d94cf06ad438cb158194e1","d26bed4e4c75f060534cdca3ae8cc84c6f0a8f25","3f314db0464ce766312a80c35681a259db63ed2c","2d4b39aabac9c5bfb4badad2e0b356c8ff532536","9205099d066ecec5159c713728d8e57c1f6b9c64","fed0a68f10ca84838991cb91c48546b688ff2c6c","c201b30948614098896e005ad45be04987d60ca0","5bb3a080e357720a3f7fecdeb3b19388332a1096","2e062484f7474551a69401fd16ce53467022170d","a0c8ae5edfe0b8f4c3c883ce8e11672fd998f98e","934c23036d0ae007fdbaeb74bd808ac2839d6d1b","3c9ac927a65af307ff3402f67a1e549d29732408","fbaf348379dcba3807e10956e9e68d6194a57027","d6f05078795e7a39af26d8c9284127350118149b","e5c6927f6e9e405da1ed648f043ce61be37f1568","3df16ba62c484dee7ce289f2ee5dbced03a061e6","2594ad313a83a140d0be17e4a9d08351a8c15d3c","0455c0f26f688fa775a6911459cdc88750f1ff86","5d68e3015f2ea15a2e352f5ed4529879150b1945","736db4e346d7045a8e4e4a2dcb2237a793c4a615","ab583b428f017e57ff1d5d29a1c451e508b329c4","ffbfcaad043e830094d875f1d7af9790054817fa","6a4f616cf2b6b21994de023b291d9b1a1e7fe39a","30064311bd31f4e6a74bb21779504d28356b7642","85eefc164a42da9bbbf342f7dd1a0dac19a0e058","73cee8801222d5e5cb40d312b72fcff3c7260d38","6a4bd6a70230b4bb1b6829998f8a83aeff773d9d","3e0731b24085e20640b37b1da951d2f20dd5a22b","b3a4001fe3fb238884eec9ee900723257db4992e","425e4b31f4d541242b60cd33093247bf4d9136fc","296430642f012f2d742fd184ee76c5f7347dd616","25754df80bd21dcd9ea8248d54c5a1e646b62bdd","fe1579e5ad766ef664cfe262cd13935973d0c191","14ad02c8dc2ce8cec6420b763121c25453ee64bd","c1db08e30511e9f9b2274ec54b03f96747632327","11538a057de35e949f077b9d8008bf9fab3e29f7","f5c9ffda69e3b190cc0fc823c4f4f7e52b5c0cc8","4e44438677bb9e4e1bbb3b3ce429c389792ed561","5ac5e6d484169cc7983339141e5de782385ad8a3","97b00fed0c0a32843502ebd31003f42e0c9f979b","590079005372f5357f7bbe2e32649c546b6aa7cc","7b3447e18b057560e3ad0f119860ce091f0c5242","83e0d5506e63c701f31874708531a19f68f6846c","fb001296abdfa1e771766ab1a41da3a0a47e5f91","f3ace923e4c21352d6cd952b90f0dcb3e3efb4c7","1d715a24edb7f16c7155e7fdb0512d572838329b","e3d577cd8f2542ea34025d1bb2086d695e2eb96f"],"title":"Parametric survival models for interval-censored data with time-dependent covariates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj028"}

This fallacy occupies a central place in the paradigm of psychometrics. Most of the founders of the discipline committed it and it makes sense of otherwise anomalous developments within the discipline, such as the permissible statistics controversy and the dominant form taken by item response theories. The fallacy is displayed by showing (1) that an attribute's quantitative structure reduces to a weak order upon differences between degrees that satisfies the double cancellation, solvability, and Archimedean conditions of conjoint measurement theory and (2) the fact that any order on the degrees themselves does not entail sufficient structure on this weak order to guarantee satisfaction of these conditions. Thus, it is possible that an ordered attribute is non-quantitative. Also, each pair of differences between degrees of an ordinal attribute falls into one of two disjoint classes: (1) those where the order relation between the pair follows from an order on the attribute and (2) those where it is independent of that order and possibly diagnostic of quantitative structure and this fact means that the distinction between order and quantity is an empirical one.","inCitations":["0677867e616404e2fe1d6eb6efbc0f787b04fd0e","ae84feeca68214c84ed030c50876a5509366117b","06d75e4ed3bf49db9a19f41d3c8e2bf0ef9c0b00","5c57f5981d52ca57226cc11c225f3c7e08a5357e","5ba850d0d0db3cd7894e11c1386f2ca9704f256d","711f0b9a7cd391fb890563c5527208a48ab02691","a8284d60c1cbec9a3b9da8ed7ccd252926ac56a0","52f95901a860152fa0ce7e4084930235e39142b9","66c720f335fbcef6c9063d8d3c5e9b45b88462be","df471839da729106fded81534bf1cc1cfc855435","dc7eeb3f08a907359362124527420dc0d60eac57","231dba961bd6f5f5cff56e705268e7a64755dfd5","f5184ce8906018b5816bde1b3f8abed6dc894963","b789878ccc6434463a761f0d5fd01ccdbe51f383","3f29d3007e935ccd835e79a5df699f7507f687a4","e94504fc0837aca6ae1aa043a425153aa9e091e8","7e83c2427a27e7fd9634bf172525263b5900463a","93f2f373547dd67562b5bb1a3535e38220996039","582ddb75104dc1bbaed2335a53e51ac260c98e49","1c9cafcadad4142fecfeb2aaad7945f7b842236c","906146ae6a1444f4a52969d724ee0ff930345806","02aad38130e041d9a028f8ee6b1d4c8e527e962d"],"title":"The psychometricians' fallacy: too clever by half?","doi":"10.1348/000711007X243582"}

Only probabilities of each observation belonging to a sub-population are available. The problem arises from several biomedical studies such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genetic studies with ungenotyped relatives where the scientific interest lies in estimating the cumulative distribution function of a trait given a specific genotype. However, in these studies subjects' genotypes may not be directly observed. The distribution of the trait outcome is therefore a mixture of several genotype-specific distributions. We characterize the complete class of consistent estimators which includes members such as one type of nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) and least squares or weighted least squares estimators. We identify the efficient estimator in the class that reaches the semiparametric efficiency bound, and we implement it using a simple procedure that remains consistent even if several components of the estimator are mis-specified. In addition, our close inspections on two commonly used NPMLEs in these problems show the surprising results that the NPMLE in one form is highly inefficient, while in the other form is inconsistent. We provide simulation procedures to illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the proposed methods through two real data examples.","inCitations":["a198d9a5589003042570257b1d9a5874780e4e9d","72d0441183782527b4ac347e787d9588dbd2fefb","e02c970453859c07c5258252599292a69acc553a","dbbad0b8fd2a230f6854ab8a469fb43918006f76","6dcc5552e18ec3111c9af1247d9b66a3585824e4"],"title":"Efficient distribution estimation for data with unobserved sub-population identifiers.","doi":"10.1214/12-EJS690"}

Although the population may continue to grow, once equilibrium is reached, the proportions of people in different age categories do not change. Stochastic analogues can be proven if vital rates fluctuate according to a stationary stochastic process. The action of random matrix products on random vectors is studied. This permits the application of Hilbert's projective metric and leads to considerable simplification of the ergodic and central limit theory of population growth.

In this paper, we consider a ROC model for which the ROC curve is a parametric function of covariates but distributions of the diagnostic test results are not specified. Covariates can be either common to all subjects or specific to those with disease. We propose a new estimation procedure based on binary indicators defined by the test result for a diseased subject exceeding various specified quantiles of the distribution of test results from non-diseased subjects with the same covariate values. This procedure is conceptually and computationally simplified relative to existing procedures. Simulation study results indicate that the approach has fairly high statistical efficiency. The new ROC regression methodology is used to evaluate childhood measurements of body mass index as a predictive marker of adult obesity.","inCitations":["4ef838f1ebd69c04bd153de0ad0818458da263a5","9094b3f9ca5f5bc7678e0110f08ec6649a0f4ff2","ab5f2c6d8013975f0289dce7e7c980aa4a3d4ae0","beea4aa0321294a7630001ba66d8081094db3264","4d3d64c7831889850c203bec0231e10bae240f89","e24bf6fddf91b2d018faf650a1fa41e156a6fedc","5b5b5baf465f7dea290046097b62f98b6557c4f2","acc2693df5239757766543999f8e10162f883895","2e19ffd3cbbc50d3233ab601e8b5eca7c0316f26","ea631c63e77a96e0c32ecb5f2a3a99a6d39de4c5","eb1bafb24e9c8774a4513232ada82a8aec679f17","3d080f89f86fcf09902dca4a10d65f02c193679f","77b872c7127179d6646c317bd1fbb6854c8e6b8b","0e028b1ee21849f7f249472cbb5633d43d95a727","691981b4c849c921ef67bf50831c7ebda6d7c912","5c8d04bd1445d38cb3964520e466be8a5ad36300","3820c00b0f173d72e5fdad54a0c547a744cd8469","d0595aecf945faab3fb5fbfff51a117ed4d78299","ab968fe2c0a890aad377b8dbd1822b288a7d611c","66a32bca58ed1c93d45cca76d40ccde42f2a0390","0f531566ccd8e5a507b2f78fc305196d8df2d1f9","acc827d8fabda77138b637a4e13fc4cbe468774b","47149c72c6cb336f6d75555db7d2cc47775e188d","9a4b29b727f22108a3ebad8534d0eb24b6aa893a","45b5663fd353f2ea7e64468ccce50b4f730f5598","509e12807f9b55f71969497ffd3fde93714d9147","653b3e48ba8e8bda8f0b6bb4de29f2d6ae02bb24","faad9ecd855504d109cf3be0924afc55c672bf65","a927e033cb3b7c8f7e87a789e60f7646e3345dd7","f3526d73933147706225395b3ebe62861c942d94","7d4270e55bae31f0a8751f5064a6ac6d4c3832db","ccd5bbdae0b738f4df733016216bfac6d1d3c5a6","068739bfd651b0a26772c9144c4c700605f5e8d1","e6b8087e9b11766f764ba289dfc83eb8a01582ff","6e2d619d603f7002e021c3872cc48c891d0ab0d4","2a0489217bb0769b722dfd50e6bf6a28eedff390","59dc0488f16129b0d1bfd8b3e903baf738a656b8","b3bf05edf0ae2cf7c84969f68e949510654c4a49","00db34dd7bc5e83a884addd61579e711ed951b32","d2c5c6c13224e2c62a47bccf961713aed235d707","d2414b15d2d61473c6a7fb671c4c5e086afb3633","1fdd95483ee52809297e9d6382732a01824f9b56","6c9133389752fb6672bcea9f35fe0b9f348ff2c2","cb2c79b70c16adf61f1d6bdedc51e878282e9b8e","6c8b0f037e98c5b9181fb391b33d7b3101640329","f98e8c7e9366e0f77799ef55bbca09be35281f8c","404ca6315a285f35c3bc6efefc69e866687072ba","87e8b65075b699c3dfc9be27f474e7609ad7fe16","1099bc59bd9de991c280905e6395f4dfdb4afcfa","014527e2efb6ddab79dc02030c7ddd6b6febdaa5","a19f30e972b0f73cabe816f64a2d0a67b1ac9d98","f623e33eb612b0806c420c0ba242bf5dc13340c1","ec5468694ab143d4462b9c7f668c952473b0b509","fe30b89c8653c622171aefb2d6a1c438187714f0","945d228d2bd4098f2abf9391613b4efd23fa442d","80f1347b2c5335026cf3c1b163b7bb95a05ebfbe","69c6fc820a086760ce8e7bad7b197609f3a9d959","71280ccb18a00a299214af22b032b888a395accf","ecd1a08c83256ce89093ddfd72bd6dcdf4164c93","1aa2b1b8745cea2ce7455570c84ed4add11f5e7c","f92fad1ac1cdf57410703c5deb28dbe22dab5553","8ab60a6dd6255e1392b56fb36b9ca1cf0e43fb38","fb8e9d3b0d6eb82c1e0cf31b630b8a746e64b57b","742e91b4eaa16e710bd70ed9120c4e714046f465","cc565256a2939cced0b39e2d7e2a41caf98cb250","28ce3124f7c5b9542468f3427a5b7748ff5e8df7","88ca6eae052d0258aab12c6510175ab56f0bd5a1","d43b4ddc2edd9749a99e7591508cd8515ddcd999","8b6fa9d73833d62235087c608404345a5be5896d","64fcb22db483908ad0a3d94a051ba9ec719a14cb","f2026b6e2b0f20081d6e0f3d0598633a09cf5f7e","2b44e54241bddf1c380adf8b26ff91e35bb76a36","a0d44cae6498311c317687e2f4c8af36451c4955","d25044e2bded2b5d90e253af3a4619e4f61834b9","28cae5f24a67c5d7f45bf6022302bef60179ff1f","288d61766ac2f2fc4200176759bca56df9d14624","7de8a40895e999901fca5c8b68f3313b4ae073e0","a1485cf49ab8fae673f658db010dba854aee2eb1","dde2593621a5e6ceb9a6901dee3932d8590492da","beedc95e984e06b7676c0e07abc883478477f4bd","d721dd1f4ded97998247491f40d45a618888672e","6cbd998312f4aaea502d2d18c7bbc3c568918164","142766a1b2e33cc391367c1e025327f287a24a92","f243f3ca77cd62c12920500376b38becc3a6bc5b","7ec680bab53481b34c9acf565eb0f7c46f7b9586","4fb551fd55b39721799910508a83cc735c628f17","317a090b2ccbeeabce88e5c1b8a02011b7bc8b49","b6ad2a7d6005cf1e6647127f49261c026c8270a6","33242a7109fa275bc3abbef90a47d69e37df7f4a","e3120beaaae2fe34aa29ecfc023c931605a07fe6","037be28de9f34573e42660c512b5f6531ae8a745","ce931fc0ebfcbc434c255e21ef28ffa67fa5667a","f6175460fe2f57739b7f3125fbfba6a61c2109f5","9d86a5eb92d3c0f2f2d41dab0a3749b1837bfbab","0708cc82e4d21929a52a0dd6c8ff2560e61748be","d000d03e81171faa4b649b2f8f3b4bb8d1424c12","81a2ea2c11eb3be4e5256fdabded841d9f63d680","006007ac1f817043fd4e3cf08ad192513938ec94","d53f2c9dfb643d7299e2e254e33e54a09267ba1f","18195c1b9ce98977cbe1e9a8e414b56e8ab5ff13","07bcc4c56ce0caf5d82ab54996906f2f8cc4732b"],"title":"Distribution-free ROC analysis using binary regression techniques.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.3.421"}

We show the problem can be reduced to that of point and interval estimation of the expected conditional covariance between treatment and response given the confounders. Our estimators are higher order U-statistics. The approach applies equally to the regular case where the expected conditional covariance is root-n estimable and to the irregular case where slower non-parametric rates prevail.","inCitations":["adf890f4bfec55926f609b0958cc42ab708c867b","a7b6848a8b07bf21fb7936b6f21b02299056697e","967d8d8b7dd1be2c02880990a5c8ca1fafba3ebb","fd7d092f01bed73e8dd5fe100efee243e0cc18e8","8137b915b83fe43c60476db8556ce8400f205730","62968fe7e7eb7334cedeb76ac1f795aeebb365fb","a8d96725525660c33256814faad47fe06611b2f1","db0c1b316aa03b1bcc0be9698dae97243b685a5e","776a1e383d697e92ce8e4168978cca12643e89a6","15a57477504246f26d124ec4ea143449a7fb46ce","30ba14f1f79c5b05fadf239fb32b0297a4605109"],"title":"Higher Order Inference On A Treatment Effect Under Low Regularity Conditions.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2011.02.030"}
