Conaway and Petroni further pointed out that it is important to evaluate the clinical activity and safety simultaneously in studying cancer treatments with more toxic chemotherapies in a phase II clinical trial. Therefore, they developed multi-stage designs with two dependent binary endpoints. However, the usual sample sizes in phase II trials make these designs difficult to control the type I error rate at a desired level over the entire null region and still have sufficient power against reasonable alternatives. Therefore, the curtailed sampling procedure summarized by Phatak and Bhatt will be applied to the two-stage designs with two dependent binary endpoints in this paper to reduce sample sizes and speed up the development process for drugs.","inCitations":["ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb","706de60030ee5d38da2cf99b98269ed50721896f"],"title":"Curtailed two-stage designs with two dependent binary endpoints.","doi":"10.1002/pst.496"}

Simultaneously extracting and integrating rich and diverse heterogeneous information in neuroimaging and/or genomics from these big datasets could transform our understanding of how genetic variants impact brain structure and function, cognitive function, and brain-related disease risk across the lifespan. Such understanding is critical for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of numerous complex brain-related disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease). However, the development of analytical methods for the joint analysis of both high-dimensional imaging phenotypes and high-dimensional genetic data, a big data squared (BD2) problem, presents major computational and theoretical challenges for existing analytical methods. Besides the high-dimensional nature of BD2, various neuroimaging measures often exhibit strong spatial smoothness and dependence and genetic markers may have a natural dependence structure arising from linkage disequilibrium. We review some recent developments of various statistical techniques for imaging genetics, including massive univariate and voxel-wise approaches, reduced rank regression, mixture models, and group sparse multi-task regression. By doing so, we hope that this review may encourage others in the statistical community to enter into this new and exciting field of research.","inCitations":["505672c2b9043af77ff21c51d8eb0ea205848479","ec83ecd1a81d4e60af4c0a6aa64234f0806a3a1e","d621c6e047cb66b3b5c3fb85cf22f91253f01315","9fb3193bb84ed26e9c6290e5468474b1d4beae31","fd3f33e21e4344c8a5f25ddb18d2d5a5c1015c4a","09056b32e48108db6286ff7eff8cc33542b6f4c5"],"title":"A Review of Statistical Methods in Imaging Genetics.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.11487"}

Various methods exist in the literature for dichotomizing continuous biomarkers. The most widely adopted minimum p-value approach uses a sequence of test statistics for all possible dichotomizations of a continuous biomarker, and it chooses the cutpoint that is associated with the maximum test statistic, or equivalently, the minimum p-value of the test. We herein propose a likelihood and resampling-based approach to dichotomizing a continuous biomarker. In this approach, the cutpoint is considered as an unknown variable in addition to the unknown outcome variables, and the likelihood function is maximized with respect to the cutpoint variable as well as the outcome variables to obtain the optimal cutpoint for the continuous biomarker. The significance level of the test for whether a cutpoint exists is assessed via a permutation test using the maximum likelihood values calculated based on the original as well as the permutated data sets. Numerical comparisons of the proposed approach and the minimum p-value approach showed that the proposed approach was not only more powerful in detecting the cutpoint but also provided markedly more accurate estimates of the cutpoint than the minimum p-value approach in all the simulation scenarios considered.","inCitations":["7351df4618091f6c4a9504c1f5ce6b6afc3ec21c","85496e56bebf9f9254e96d3ec03f8a672243244c","28578424be2860fedf3a1886ec64b1e53db2cc5e"],"title":"A likelihood and resampling based approach to dichotomizing a continuous biomarker in medical research.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.756503"}

Models that utilise such multivariate event time outcomes are quite valuable in clinical decision-making. We comprehensively review the literature for implementation of joint models involving more than a single event time per subject. We consider the distributional and modelling assumptions, including the association structure, estimation approaches, software implementations, and clinical applications.

However, the acceptance of a standardized approach and implementation are slow. Statisticians play major roles in these organizations, and have a great opportunity to be involved and drive the shaping of future BRA. Method We performed a literature search of recent reviews and initiatives assessing BRA methodologies, and grouped them to assist those new to BRA in learning, understanding, and choosing methodologies. We summarized the key points and discussed the impact of this emerging field on various stakeholders, particularly statisticians in the pharmaceutical industry. Results We provide introductory, essential, special interest, and further information and initiatives materials that direct readers to the most relevant materials, which were published between 2000 and 2013.  Based on recommendations in these materials we supply a toolkit of advocated BRA methodologies. Discussion Despite initiatives promoting these methodologies, there are still barriers, one of which being the lack of a consensus on the most appropriate methodologies among stakeholders. However, this opens up opportunities, for statisticians in the pharmaceutical industry especially, to champion appropriate BRA methodology use throughout the pharmaceutical product lifecycle. Conclusions This article may serve as a starting point for discussions and to reach a mutual consensus for methodology selection in a particular situation. Regulators and pharmaceutical industry should continue to collaborate to develop and take forward BRA methodologies, and by clear communication develop a mutual understanding of the key issues.

The method has been appealing because of its flexibility in targeting the regression coefficients under different forms of distortion. We extend this methodology proposed for regression into the framework of varying coefficient models, where the goal is to target the covariate-adjusted relationship between longitudinal variables. The proposed method of covariate-adjusted varying coefficient model (CAVCM) is illustrated with an analysis of a longitudinal data set containing calcium absorbtion and intake measurements on 188 subjects. We estimate the age-dependent relationship between these two variables adjusted for the covariate body surface area. Simulation studies demonstrate the flexibility of CAVCM in handling different forms of distortion in the longitudinal setting.","inCitations":["2d37b4547f7533e31cabfff002fc3d47e1235490","0912fd835cf6d0a6183748204cf9181ebbebfb93","2e45f533b05bdf31426fe737ab0d99a49137250b","3b1f66403ad88f91a1051f2eb6ef24ef6b52d1d6"],"title":"Covariate-adjusted varying coefficient models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj004"}

Consensus exists that clear objectives should be defined along with the causal estimands; trial design and conduct should maximize adherence to the protocol specified interventions; and a sensible primary analysis should be used along with plausible sensitivity analyses. Two general categories of estimands are effects of the drug as actually taken (de facto, effectiveness) and effects of the drug if taken as directed (de jure, efficacy). Motivated by examples, we argue that no single estimand is likely to meet the needs of all stakeholders and that each estimand has strengths and limitations. Therefore, stakeholder input should be part of an iterative study development process that includes choosing estimands that are consistent with trial objectives. To this end, an example is used to illustrate the benefit from assessing multiple estimands in the same study. A second example illustrates that maximizing adherence reduces sensitivity to missing data assumptions for de jure estimands but may reduce generalizability of results for de facto estimands if efforts to maximize adherence in the trial are not feasible in clinical practice. A third example illustrates that whether or not data after initiation of rescue medication should be included in the primary analysis depends on the estimand to be tested and the clinical setting. We further discuss the sample size and total exposure to placebo implications of including post-rescue data in the primary analysis.

Because estimated weights are used for meta-regression analysis in practice, the assumed or estimated covariance matrix used in meta-regression is not strictly correct, due to possible errors in estimating the weights. Therefore, this note investigates the use of a robust variance estimation approach for obtaining variances of the parameter estimates in random effects meta-regression inference. This method treats the assumed covariance matrix of the effect measure variables as a working covariance matrix. Using an example of meta-analysis data from clinical trials of a vaccine, the robust variance estimation approach is illustrated in comparison with two other methods of variance estimation. A simulation study is presented, comparing the three methods of variance estimation in terms of bias and coverage probability. We find that, despite the seeming suitability of the robust estimator for random effects meta-regression, the improved variance estimator of Knapp and Hartung (2003) yields the best performance among the three estimators, and thus may provide the best protection against errors in the estimated weights.","inCitations":["92ced4078f0dae7e44f08084cb6ca18768711dcc","f74673049303e88051ff98566391a676691ae67a","e55442871b0b9ddd9263f14eb38be91ee261a2f2","52043b3b269985d0915efe5cc87058f0655b3e57","c54bdb76ec2df9596b7279eeea4d0a9b1329f182","3a5455bb83ce4394f02c38f7ab4aa100f40118d1","fd01ab48827865746b5b9b16ce7a2a5def4a3ad5","12ab0156dd67c6e6e149b7722c0cf7c2a2474ce7","82fad8c9dc307c6c0df906995f59d1d94ab4313c","6f2549bbcc5d8d88b0cd66524f7e201da3be4e4e","f0f6fd56bd4576c412fc462e75ff198bfed44c5d","8a94eae113761541961268015e37093bd8249771","841adb9b2ab355f044abb5fe2e12d1d3e687ff1b","302cf57f8b19fe88dfc5fc964e643cf4bfffdd85","5bc724c3e9c7a5371be30ecc30993fa1ee7da0d8","4c4ef9dc08520f00fb4cf5b6ac7459b5fc802604","581ebebd26b08a5bdd7d6c6786a415c10982555c","9f0067430a9b0a4474193c11b7602f4fbded3d0f","a90ce28876d771ae647f576164cc8a92e5983a04","51e6df35e40c04f348769e718f586ee2181a69b6","5b4a83bc2127f01a7ca4f0cf4f3a0684fcf072a1","14b094ad014bf78d05c80e1fd0c07c5ee7c39090","632047dea16b6bc06e6de42b5c4021cae240bc65","8ff0dc45045c06102f88d4d285417567fea60d52","b4725799a554d622c8c960cd407477df69e15211","a98affe2e9a60bd2d7613766c1ff14f47c9f8f51","b83c118e8740ca7e8bc2983fdef74021e89b9f0b","c043d695749757cbb477905f5fde48acad4745bc","9a44a59c02713a96b7e691ed709eb139a9b36e9b","2228b91b01a146a14a7bb313f30a16e615ec45ef","1496610736241c16107d54674ce647526317a725"],"title":"A note on variance estimation in random effects meta-regression.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200067915"}

As the required code to fit the models is non-trivial, we provide example computer code to fit the models, and show how to use the output to derive measures of repeatability and limits of agreement.","inCitations":["b9d2d47249aa19fb64d266a0dfe3962831459075","9ef5e21972dbf694b809aafcad58453771e3a602","2643f69c576d6d8db6cfc82e33713878a0eb8d30","38f46248e013fe8b70ab5a72cf99ba003970c78f","347ae1711f44ca82d365bab6790ea99edc6befe2","f076f9ca2162985dbddc6faf4d0e30de4e193383","4584c73894e65a19d495b292655ebde5639ffadd","486ed31108b105451596719542260b50a8e76b40","749b8e8b154eef4ef5ce515b9f38c6fc4a183946","a1aaad95651ce138f5de82331e1e6a0993068f22","cf98b3b844afc5af7e28e5080c5a347b0525e8ce","6a66fe31159336f43d99f78bf2b2cd538d7d0824","968d9d96ae0fb9489038e0655ff9a91e67482b9e","e83820f8f64c856ae76318c1ccc2ba5e6fd76e2f","da57d7b2cf22b611d258e90078a25a1a5fedbded","f8091b40daf49f11e3be103740a89dcad1002dfe","34b73b2c6b4a2149fbaede74e4ff92fed5740cf9","9e686efebc41b49915d9d58e9fcffe13f1bcb600","2586731eefc499e29c2e1d9d308bec6a0c94815e","60ee343d7fa76709977fde2f8c08cbf8af519042","e867ab52ff76ce426ed282ee35eb424a845463f4","03c80e240ab53cbf2e8b0848b02766d70eec3772","c410dbc0b79a111afa7869b075f40f1d31918ff8","8329f8db056c004c8abe9c5bd0f6e98977f1f3a7","7961113a78f5542dc456c1d97a3d004d50dc8325","c1e69a6fe02d5a5536a48dc371f4652e07ea9157","9a4c1abb68de566edcd754d94fbce2c9ed0dd058","3d8ab4e0fb0aff8f8f2c0ab271091d638fb45997","79c6789cf48521fe13b43f582c1ebc02b55e1f41","e47da43179782705c39a1ed3f947bac791632b3b","3565683d51608f72195e9b9c0addae7b0317120c","c1115e264e2b8e0a3bb60b936987a82f08032f34","8e4e45eb55cfd1860d5f50db574d869c26263816","a71522097a2092a7488796c02c5e8ca31507ed4d","e31eda651e33cddbb9b66d4d9b75e95d879697ad","41aba2c92a5c523525f98acdde8fbe96cb5be996","46382bb93c5b79f003196499ba71e0b819928a6b","82630fee6ab40c6908cbb39e349ba5d2e946457a","9fb80036690fb32b03df0959e6c174d8b9472112","124cba55a95634e697ff23fc93af09eec278a232","4229b9b11033a33514ce6b43aa0419d3f9f72800","691e0015c8ae83b55642b6c4e1d6641035cdf08b","db69c650f865e71fbce20ba106c776a28d674c1f","86dff08dfe10f9d917dbbfc39e07cb2cddaca3c6","cdf38d60fa5c8599e4ae348f89bb8ec407b8948b","64c74b5d884575d444e5de75f9dd32aec976d3a7","ed3f604a0ef0675e47785bad084524e1c9cbbb7c","76c0fa51b23fa55be2b0c9943496c94de6dcf185","7f2229617ef2e84421ffd3185dba3ca720b4cb6b","b764266b72b1bc5b1c85e0af3ff11cdf80d1bcef","116a579131a47787548412cffcb9b96ba84ef478","f46b9b41480486391e60eb94d4f21e0dcb04e855","c8cc37cbd39284e242b716c42e82438b2f5dff3a","5703b23a70ccbac7e47acfe690388fab0a32c5bf","2d132d8374526113c66e1bc72324aaf555b68a99","27bed2f5150fe582c2db83cfcc194c48a0f9072e","36ea01d0dd844da8a9037feb9acf9bd3ce61b9f4","ad8c54b0e2686bf35155c10cb966ab2d76f65792","01798e98cdd61e6629c9f5a2bf874da6973b4c19","df9291945065e973e07295d24b06b017921d237e","c238babfe7ab0f546542ed5de4292d1fd7530e0a","209e8f0e6c695950c1bc7abd1dc4a64e84a74e22","e8ef6ff69f808b70680aaea045a90b07f5614bd0","f7fd397ee7403c43a5b2cd1f88ae17889be8c4a8","22f1e515b1fbd7d4b75c8990b59b4b84c766c20e","c7d089860f012221483b73d857f5c0cb9b432bb6","958a99f27dcc181009af611b315b488c941904d3","10ed1555306654153654e26d829b31b7f851a22b","2f995a15fbcca9cb7830cafe8b2b303ae8304056","bc8a9a729a48dfe914390ccd384ee850d0f5e283","453236ddf1755f3c16ba7fda8ef6a2843f819a71","553798bba482172f84ecef98ef150d97151d3aca","05f28c1557b4480aa16626c4225035fef4c5f09d","66161a70d2d545c90cdbd4a588089ca4e25d463b","f85930d10d50f6288b98e2e3f0cb5bee015a4142","e57f9e9a469c0975c4cd51e69de505f016e149db","4202363ec74fcf13d980ad2781039192c112313a","b0a443cf6b454d66f367fcfcab60a4f4852c15d1","c633b4332b5f59bc51d9bb2e2a883cdb0f8a2058","a670537020b5d0724de68aea00d3a5e3f679809c","22c7b6539c2f726b13fe6528cc16453f816b96be","dd6c635fe7b0933eb0be0caad854fc4f19072e9b","ec50d6f5a4629c49ac211fef9d8639034e783624","61b2d06a9e9c283a316765d3831a24b6e12445bf","0f8db413ccaaf810412455ec9211e45d317f5907","8bcb8078f2e844c33a117b8f17f403da076ca7af","2b6a88702d24d8ebc723f5bcd32b6c00d551406d","51b50091e8e3d8b47e6ec1fba5db35b913f1713f","846d2e2a7b85679dcd50520506683a7124296796","7a6938b6f33ae0679c34b7339cb58d5d05cab154","30977602280832a565cd738593296024b6264c69","a8dd9887d9a0e289bc6bd061c4d7f3ba7d2006df","299b919c56c6f7ec10507513abc773ef3c76b49d","1883824242b24e56f0e30042b2b25895aeef9034","04f3736ed60990a3270aa9e558be3c693c01c628","68978606284166e9c061dca4d4d0db2891ade604","c550aefdc9721d6261d3b7118ce4a9eb57586f22","a0562c10db417e08aa9ee6c10d4e38ef811f17fd","d899eaeb6bb66e20cc6e92ef88632e168951ceef","fb618189d19c614d520ba0f33165c3c2c9e4b63f","b2421dcdebb5a723ceb6678a013b6aa2f43b3418","64313d2a1215580cff3bc66516e2a6c49c1acde1","929a57578437aa736d3b4a66c5a222be6ae661c0","add517a8f42d2bb2d5dd06d7d141f9f7fcba8a16","6d7268c64ac63e37b341edc8a1800df07537feef","8b5d79e73eff9ef4fade63c303c69b4b01184336"],"title":"Statistical Models for Assessing Agreement in Method Comparison Studies with Replicate Measurements","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1107"}

However, this method relies on the proportional hazards assumption in that it has the maximal power in this circumstance. In certain disease areas or populations, some patients can be curable and never experience the events despite a long follow-up. The event accumulation may dry out after a certain period of follow-up and the treatment effect could be reflected as the combination of improvement of cure rate and the delay of events for those uncurable patients. Study power depends on both cure rate improvement and hazard reduction. In this paper, we illustrate these practical issues using simulation studies and explore sample size recommendations, alternative ways for clinical cutoffs, and efficient testing methods with the highest study power possible.","inCitations":["8182a4f2f6acdd9d46b8040b4af3287bae107204"],"title":"Design considerations in clinical trials with cure rate survival data: A case study in oncology.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1840"}

They provide a useful way to assess association between these two kinds of data, which in clinical studies are often collected jointly on a series of individuals and may help understanding, for instance, the mechanisms of recovery of a certain disease or the efficacy of a given therapy. When a nonlinear mixed-effects model is used to fit the longitudinal trajectories, the existing estimation strategies based on likelihood approximations have been shown to exhibit some computational efficiency problems (De la Cruz et al., 2011). In this article we consider a Bayesian estimation procedure for the joint model with a nonlinear mixed-effects model for the longitudinal data and a generalized linear model for the primary response. The proposed prior structure allows for the implementation of an MCMC sampler. Moreover, we consider that the errors in the longitudinal model may be correlated. We apply our method to the analysis of hormone levels measured at the early stages of pregnancy that can be used to predict normal versus abnormal pregnancy outcomes. We also conduct a simulation study to assess the importance of modelling correlated errors and quantify the consequences of model misspecification.","inCitations":["05c5c2cc027b71d61a6228f3012994e79492c028","9886413c4ca00b7badd4cfab672a7ea8efdf6604","17a5720e2e3b53e5e2e21183161a0f7df85a8176"],"title":"Bayesian regression analysis of data with random effects covariates from nonlinear longitudinal measurements","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2015.08.020"}

The differences and similarities between the non-stochastic and stochastic approaches are demonstrated by two examples, one of which has a longitudinal design. The empirical comparison is facilitated by deriving, as a heuristic device, a statistic based on the maximum likelihood function for three-mode factor analysis and its associated degrees of freedom for the three-mode component models. Furthermore, within the present context a case is made for interpreting the core array as second-order components.","inCitations":["c1812a27bd06386ac37b82530150ef0e852a4b68","3de0e80837eb30963a5d008b4a7767b13a343a05","eb27fb09ca4773d667d80e2146d8b71643d813c2","b64c95c1e497506ba6ffa4ccedf5211dbef86b9f","8c1398ceb5d6252be0f99bd0bc757f66ee72a697","7fdd09d067659462db82ec4237c04c90325af633"],"title":"Three-mode analysis of multimode covariance matrices.","doi":"10.1348/000711003770480066"}

The data formed part of a multicentre investigation jointly sponsored by the European Union and the International Olympic Committee. The data are such that for each individual there is a matrix of marker variables by time point (nominally 8 markers at each of 7 time points). Data arise out of a double-blind trial in which individuals are given growth hormone at one of two dose levels or placebo daily for 28 days. Monitoring by means of blood samples is at 0, 21, 28, 30, 33, 42 and 84 days. We give a new method of Bayesian discrimination for multivariate longitudinal data. This involves a Kronecker product covariance structure for the time by measurements (markers) data on each individual. This structure is estimated by an empirical Bayes approach, using an ECM algorithm, within a Bayesian Gaussian discrimination model. In future one may have markers for an individual at one or more time points. The method gives probabilities that an individual is on placebo or on one of the two dose regimes.","inCitations":["7a1d27d185b510e7a775c5c8244a1d0a9d9135ef","e10d42def842b340a91be62a3a74528bdf0dd4b2","45f9915e8dc59d0bb1ee1a85cbb326774c393b24","6e7933eaa84ed6deedaf43aa6e4e67b786e8f7b4","a6d71d5b1e67bd9449d0945a8c20c817f9475f59","115cb45f7bdf9349bb890a1042767f27202ed3e8","cc7c51c1ec496d7cbdb467f0851c5186cdf971b8","dc98f9e243bfa754cc4d4af25375158cf26114b0","85a7ec1d68998bb4a52d1d4f4254fa24612ab2f5","65957463bceedef928889ef4be27d9c47ebcd1b8","5128d77e692a93fb045858d5a708f1ec31c5cd12","133de85417b162ea05a0d5a6724fdd8c8c107816","69268c90c2c0012b23dd682a9b1b7e4ad8d11112"],"title":"Bayesian discrimination with longitudinal data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/2.4.417"}

We show that BET determines the optimal number of trees by adapting to the data heterogeneity. Compared with the other ensemble methods, BET requires much fewer trees and shows equivalent prediction accuracy using weighted averaging. Moreover, each tree in BET provides variable selection criterion and interpretation for each subset. We developed an efficient estimating procedure with improved estimation strategies in both CART and mixture models. We demonstrate these advantages of BET with simulations and illustrate the approach with a real-world data example involving regression of lung function measurements obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis.

In epidemiologic studies, categorical covariates are often misclassified. We present methods for obtaining point and interval estimates of the PAR and the partial PAR (pPAR) in the presence of misclassification, filling an important existing gap in public health evaluation methods. We use a likelihood-based approach to estimate parameters in the models for the disease and for the misclassification process, under main study/internal validation study and main study/external validation study designs, and various plausible assumptions about transportability. We assessed the finite sample perf ormance of this method via a simulation study, and used it to obtain corrected point and interval estimates of the pPAR for high red meat intake and alcohol intake in relation to colorectal cancer incidence in the HPFS, where we found that the estimated pPAR for the two risk factors increased by up to 317% after correcting for bias due to misclassification.","inCitations":["9adb3b473e3403816b734a4be4f6188880e154dd"],"title":"Estimation and inference for the population attributable risk in the presence of misclassification.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz067"}

Such investigations are usually based on the classification results of a group of subjects according to whether they have the disease. To classify subjects, screening tests that are inexpensive and nonintrusive to the test subjects are frequently used to produce results in a timely manner. However, such screening tests may suffer from high levels of misclassification. Although it is often possible to design a gold-standard test or device that is not subject to misclassification, such devices are usually costly and time-consuming, and in some cases intrusive to the test subjects. As a compromise between these two approaches, it is possible to use data that are obtained by the method of double-sampling. In this article, we derive and investigate four test statistics for testing a hypothesis on disease prevalence with double-sampling data. The test statistics are implemented through both the asymptotic method suitable for large samples and approximate unconditional method suitable for small samples. Our simulation results show that the approximate unconditional method usually produces a more satisfactory empirical type I error rate and power than its asymptotic counterpart, especially for small to moderate sample sizes. The results also suggest that the score test and the Wald test based on an estimate of variance with parameters estimated under the null hypothesis outperform the others. An real example is used to illustrate the proposed methods.","inCitations":["4243cded47b7b0d4a39f02940420d91b60ce187e","66926e92e09cc1dc40fadc7c9a7168970d8d19ee","123458409e06a7e95b98088610459bf922a50286","a2955ae88cc8b30f54790e9d03780a9b60ca5f25","56be1e2f15cf8ffcfb6e5b5616b3cfca6d5da77c"],"title":"Test procedures for disease prevalence with partially validated data.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.544527"}

To alleviate the bias expected from incorrect model specification for these nuisance parameters in observational studies, data-adaptive estimation and in particular an ensemble learning approach known as Super Learning has been proposed as an alternative to the common practice of estimation based on arbitrary model specification. While the theoretical arguments against the use of the latter haphazard estimation strategy are evident, the extent to which data-adaptive estimation can improve inferences in practice is not. Some practitioners may view bias concerns over arbitrary parametric assumptions as academic considerations that are inconsequential in practice. They may also be wary of data-adaptive estimation of the propensity scores for fear of greatly increasing estimation variability due to extreme weight values. With this report, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the potential practical consequences of the choice of estimation strategy for the propensity scores in real-world comparative effectiveness research. Method: We implement secondary analyses of Electronic Health Record data from a large cohort of type 2 diabetes patients to evaluate the effects of four adaptive treatment intensification strategies for glucose control (dynamic treatment regimens) on subsequent development or progression of urinary albumin excretion. Three Inverse Probability Weighting estimators are implemented using both model-based and data-adaptive estimation strategies for the propensity scores. Their practical performances for proper confounding and selection bias adjustment are compared and evaluated against results from previous randomized experiments. Conclusion: Results suggest both potential reduction in bias and increase in efficiency at the cost of an increase in computing time when using Super Learning to implement Inverse Probability Weighting estimators to draw causal inferences.","inCitations":["1c27c6016cbc706b99b8efe32d8aa02678bccb54","48d4f716939215907dc51d5bbd6d45c7b05f0e29","13c456db564074c88d556ab76d6f38c8952a045a","b634bfa3f51c69ecadf627a316aded489d460067","e451e4e5bd2f1031717b4fd75051dd79d176230d"],"title":"A Case Study of the Impact of Data-Adaptive Versus Model-Based Estimation of the Propensity Scores on Causal Inferences from Three Inverse Probability Weighting Estimators","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0028"}

In the special case of a binary choice between alternatives characterized on several attributes, present models include essentially the maximin and maximax rules, the dominance rule, the conjunctive and disjunctive rules, the majority and the weighted set of differences rules, the choice by greatest attractiveness rule, the lexicographic, the minimum difference lexicographic and the lexicographic semi-order rules, the addition of utility differences and the sequential accumulation of differences rules. To account for expert’s information processing in a binary choice task, Barthelemy and Mullet (1986) proposed and tested a slightly more complex and flexible model, inspired by the work of Montgomery (1983). This model, called the moving basis heuristics, coordinates four types of rules: 1°) lexicographic rules, 2°) threshold rules, 3°) conjunctive rules, 4°) disjunctives rules. It builds on the principle that the dominance rule is used as a major one and that all the other rules are justused to obtain dominance structure as quickly as possible. Three basic principles are in fact involved in the model: (i) a parsimony principle, (ii) a reliability principle, (iii) a decidability principle. Empirical data supporting the model have been presented and discussed previously (Barthelemy and Mullet, 1986). In this paper we discuss the model in relation to other models and we present the results of three other experiments. The first two replicate the basic experiments; in the third one, experts’ verbal justifications are analyzed.","inCitations":["d9644e5c987b452ee45e11588daddea967809093"],"title":"Choice basis: a model for multi-attribute preference.","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-83943-6_12"}

In this work, we suggest a new K-fold cross validation procedure to select a candidate 'optimal' model from each hold-out fold and average the K candidate 'optimal' models to obtain the ultimate model. Due to the averaging effect, the variance of the proposed estimates can be significantly reduced. This new procedure results in more stable and efficient parameter estimation than the classical K-fold cross validation procedure. In addition, we show the asymptotic equivalence between the proposed and classical cross validation procedures in the linear regression setting. We also demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed procedure via two examples of parameter sparsity regularization and quantile smoothing splines modeling. We illustrate the promise of the proposed method through simulations and a real data example.","inCitations":["3b591223eb05109d443746eb9c6203f2837503a8","ca48022a1a5a3bf868daf4fa7b6e36e354563eea","646119a08af408719bfb1f1c8b77f76ab2080b96","76a3b5e0044560cdc36c79e891b5bd043051ccc4","f2810fc3facd19d55020c29cebb1ede8a0903a67","99d7547ed2b95f9c901e35142ab7605b048e02d0","1cb7e784a560f8bd2122bbb0274657192972f561","637871aaf1d76f3af2a2536db2d48124e474fcb0","ee7acb285cb9522ba362126e961e72a8bcac21c9","44f3411dff8f1d6e8c3dcfc2362cef1e3462ce80","9b1a0ec66c2f8833de34f4c3dd1420ab221a7168","74a833a02c0da1a8727fa218019e72bc9b8219fa","bd8f8f878028c0f47947d25fd4013584f682148f","0a7d5fa7c43abb8172b5a482a6cddb72830f22ce","254d8f77a1be9b5f9af835a4cf06d3d2a4dc40c3","2b2990fb1b978112b11c188aeaea4fe80b1c17cd","8a01cdb15efcf04ab4b3953c6059717fa85bb03f","bcac129a4c69a5ca27c870ce9a35369553cfce22","4a8494b153f2141083e317283e9d5538033aa631","6ae0f6be42d0e4aa386080d91fd15f44f1593a05","03071ed4c88de8b4b5de50a9f73ecf89cbc398e0","556bc49f5369ccfdd2528fba4443a7ed86016613","aed0761d10fa9485c21c062861cc3f82f86a464b","9f2a9b4dd2c864f4ddf667443849498be22455a2","3262f3cc5b32ba5a997392480acd5fc93caa7939","484a1bd53ad8d5519eab7978fe8815708c4e7d3b","614fc1ee0ea372fd85d57846a8056236a78e6662","38f8628915cca1b285acbadbf1104b2aa75957ce","e628a8026bf8f83ce9d9af5fa6842e89b52e678d","a7c38abc5ab99ec1db02e1c8849cb6e474d24b16","972c4790b47bd273d5d1deb1dd0b92fe91a17699","0bca16e632a4ca774c96c039ff3d23a84b8461c2","b347e53cc6bf0a8bcc6d178041fb5a653b8f751e","dbf4546339bb458f7aa4d2d0403aba0fa1036766","38fa9cabe14b778848267a11c70b05bd9a42655e","de9e1d35aff7320135cedb4988ad3205cc4ad363","34679f18409d3f739520fea36e5429e6cdd30061","3b588c27b1230022f09c028c7f5dddaf1f9555d8","249d6fc31cf5d776efb4d5ba4e3addb9f26e9627","18d91839252c25e78f77d762a06c728d316e64c9","d178e4dc128c80a89bce8c4ef70167baae4b2e38","600009eda5606be5bfece3245633b0af75744687"],"title":"A K-fold Averaging Cross-validation Procedure.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2015.1010532"}

NMA is an extension of standard meta-analysis where indirect as well as direct information is combined and can be seen as similar to the analysis of incomplete-block designs. We illustrate it with an example involving three treatments, using fixed-effects and random-effects models, and using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. As most statisticians in the pharmaceutical industry are familiar with SAS® software for analyzing clinical trials, we provide example code for each of the methods we illustrate. One issue that has been overlooked in the literature is the choice of constraints applied to random effects, and we show how this affects the estimates and standard errors and propose a symmetric set of constraints that is equivalent to most current practice. Finally, we discuss the role of statisticians in planning and carrying out NMAs and the strategy for dealing with important issues such as heterogeneity.","inCitations":["3c6bc10a9d87b4abc5addf0fd0e6161d4567faf4","eef146acda8c6f1250988b870c72c717ab705728","3a324f168415bb4e843b3d61fbd252cada88be19","e2adaca4e5ffb9de68ae843890ae21d7211f9e64","19a82276d6dc9f95ea7d6bfa5dd0a68edf139c2d","84b155dee5b09adb0f260bcdded032b916f89b86","56db222a731cb9970209a1085dfc72a0f2135eb5","7ce718bad816fbd71829a5e5708eb1bd17acd433","bef40a474cc46d5d1f6fef39680f3712fa19754d","759862eb46a1eea30bd8168b551eafdbd2a1630f","0f75e0992f48d2244990a8b4ba9db07b58e63780","f8f7960537c5f01c86e137aad84ed480782c8e63","4090ec524897e8c55747b644cfc8599c6f1af03b","593fdf49920a475b4313ca1dd52cb50c19af7d6d","77a10765daa993dd2b7043424d63ea7dbce068e5","29cd4ca17bfcbd5a858db829698a141b071cd3b2","d1e6869cddaeb9b4c50d6f31514b60e51b046c75","8c58e6ea603b80947a8bb58bdd8dee0413f88acd","7d5a5bdbb3716ca0f448ceb00647693620793d3d","cbd51d8882fe78be485e48453dc5e557c57447ab","234c993b08fc2e97fbbdbbf09d25cf91c05bacfd","c1890b48051e42d4a960e349ea4c18cd3693efba","116f768ab6e7df6e22a5bd05a7e3c07df5ae2a42","1adb4637120b5717860cbb9bd9b194417f406b99","f4276612668b078f5c3e754715cfe8bcb87ea1be","5a3c19f9f2a50dce244ece8903463aa0b3cd9464","b19565b719b059d3943eb0c77d35fe75bc86dda6","2032e24f9919e4189eb0080173921b430fd16929","601bc071cb1e4250d948de1e51be28d2fd6d53b3","24c964a6a9925138c413ec681eab6f0ac83729ed","18dfe02b84f6ce75854211fe82e630f40f7aa623","3e7796c337933ddd01f7e36a44881e559ba97281","da3fcdf4347a0784d6021d354cd7b3c1454c6357","58c3024cc1b519bb2d5431603cbeb405ca30b99d","c697e33a8e685ce56332df3de40159bd9004dfc2","44ab320f0add93b34cf4e0202ec4ebc6ed2dcad6"],"title":"Statistical approaches for conducting network meta-analysis in drug development.","doi":"10.1002/pst.533"}

In such a decomposition, the complete set of main effects and interaction terms can be viewed as a collection of vectors, matrices and arrays that share various index sets defined by the factor levels. For many types of categorical factors, it is plausible that an ANOVA decomposition exhibits some consistency across orders of effects, in that the levels of a factor that have similar main-effect coefficients may also have similar coefficients in higher-order interaction terms. In such a case, estimation of the higher-order interactions should be improved by borrowing information from the main effects and lower-order interactions. To take advantage of such patterns, this article introduces a class of hierarchical prior distributions for collections of interaction arrays that can adapt to the presence of such interactions. These prior distributions are based on a type of array-variate normal distribution, for which a covariance matrix for each factor is estimated. This prior is able to adapt to potential similarities among the levels of a factor, and incorporate any such information into the estimation of the effects in which the factor appears. In the presence of such similarities, this prior is able to borrow information from well-estimated main effects and lower-order interactions to assist in the estimation of higher-order terms for which data information is limited.","inCitations":["2135da6f6a4ab180118fb57711cd78f8f4d8e926","0cc35ff2dab687d78d2303a0fc9597a8d0fda2d8","348093ed8616d18461443d42dc9c8090603f30f1"],"title":"Hierarchical Array Priors for Anova Decompositions of Cross-classified Data.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS685"}

It is of the interest to find the relationship between plasma and semen viral loads. To address this type of problem, we developed an empirical goodness-of-fit test to check the Clayton model assumption for bivariate truncated data. We also used truncated tau to estimate the dependence parameter in the Clayton model for this type of data.

Here we study identifiability and efficient estimation of causal effects on vector outcomes, in such cases where treatment is unconfounded but partially missing. We consider a missing at random setting where missingness in treatment can depend not only on complex covariates, but also on post-treatment outcomes. We give a new identifying expression for average treatment effects in this setting, along with the efficient influence function for this parameter in a nonparametric model, which yields a nonparametric efficiency bound. We use this latter result to construct nonparametric estimators that are less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality than usual, e. g. by having faster rates of convergence than the complex nuisance estimators they rely on. Further we show that these estimators can be root-n consistent and asymptotically normal under weak nonparametric conditions, even when constructed using flexible machine learning. Finally we apply these results to the problem of causal inference with a partially missing instrumental variable.","inCitations":["c50615943a23778877f12811c5e47de5fe539373"],"title":"Efficient Nonparametric Causal Inference with Missing Exposure Information","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2019-0087"}

If the coefficient function is sparsely represented in the wavelet domain, we may employ the well-known LASSO to select a relatively small number of nonzero wavelet coefficients. This is a natural approach to take but to date, the properties of such an estimator have not been studied. In this paper we describe the wavelet-based LASSO approach to regressing scalars on functions and investigate both its asymptotic convergence and its finite-sample performance through both simulation and real-data application. We compare the performance of this approach with existing methods and find that the wavelet-based LASSO performs relatively well, particularly when the true coefficient function is spiky.

In the context of adaptive randomization, either restricted or response-adaptive procedures, it is unclear how accurate such Monte Carlo approximations are, or how many Monte Carlo sequences to generate. In this paper, we describe several randomization procedures for which there is a known exact or asymptotic distribution of the randomization test. For a special class of procedures, called [Formula: see text], and binary responses, the exact test statistic has a simple closed form. For the limited subset of existing procedures with known exact and asymptotic distributions, we can use these as a benchmark for the accuracy of Monte Carlo randomization techniques. We conclude that Monte Carlo tests are very accurate, and require minimal computation time. For simple tests with binary response in the class of [Formula: see text] procedures, the exact distribution provides the best test, but Monte Carlo approximations can be used when the exact distribution is difficult to compute.","inCitations":["9a4d5afa0422b166714cc25b39d6bf6ee8c69122"],"title":"On the use of randomization tests following adaptive designs.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1052486"}

Although some augmentation procedures exist for obtaining counterfactual responses, they are specific to vaccine trials. We outline extensions to the existing augmentations and suggest augmentations of three trial designs outside the setting of vaccines. We outline the assumptions needed to identify the causal estimands of interest under each augmented design, under which standard likelihood-based methods can be used to evaluate intermediate responses as principal surrogates. Two of these designs, crossover and individual stepped-wedge, allow for the observation of clinical endpoints under both treatment and control for some subset of subjects and can therefore improve efficiency over standard parallel trial designs. The third, the treatment run-in design, allows for the observation of a baseline measure that may be as useful a surrogate as the true counterfactual intermediate response. As the evaluation methods rely on several assumptions, we also outline a remediation analysis, which can be used to help overcome assumption violations. We illustrate our suggested methods in an example from a drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment trial.","inCitations":["1aaae9b9dc0f183f58a3bf358fa3ddcd2a123829"],"title":"Augmented trial designs for evaluation of principal surrogates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv055"}
