Valid estimators from the generalized linear mixed model usually rely on the correct specification of the missing data mechanism. An incorrectly specified missing mechanism may lead to a biased estimator. In this article, we propose a class of unbiased estimating equations using pairwise conditional technique to deal with the generalized linear mixed model under benign non-ignorable missingness where specification of the missing model is not needed. We show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under certain conditions. Simulation results and an example using longitudinal course of neuropsychological data are also shown.","inCitations":["dae8c9bdbedd88ea6163439c1df20fcd9e815c6b","4f07e23f6a36f0588e140d1a99f5104b97f3ab11","795f8dfd4dd45e55161df9449d789992c73d1eed","dcfee8ecc5ef27c8dbb62d55514f20ef3bb588a6","0c0dc57ea8aae6cf99d14c90db37e3c83c4f098f"],"title":"Handling missing responses in generalized linear mixed model without specifying missing mechanism.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903242761"}

In this paper, we propose a new semiparametric additive single-index model for estimating individualized treatment strategy. The model assumes a flexible and nonparametric link function for the interaction between treatment and predictive covariates. We estimate the rule via monotone B-splines and establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators. Both simulations and an real data application demonstrate that the proposed method has a competitive performance.","inCitations":["a86a0037671805bcf683ab656c5e892ec456dd51","0e3a80473a17528fb5c82386e2f8f06ea4dcc56f"],"title":"Semiparametric Single-Index Model for Estimating Optimal Individualized Treatment Strategy.","doi":"10.1214/17-EJS1226"}

Methods available in the literature are, however, typically not stringent enough in identifying such genes, particularly when the profile requires equivalence of gene expression levels at certain time points. In this paper, the authors introduce a new methodology, called gene profiling, that uses simultaneous differential and equivalent gene expression level testing to rank genes according to a prespecified gene expression profile. Gene profiling treats the vector of true gene expression levels as a linear combination of appropriate vectors, for example, vectors that give the required criteria for the profile. This gene profile model is fitted to the data, and the resulting parameter estimates are summarized in a single test statistic that is then used to rank the genes. The theoretical underpinnings of gene profiling (equivalence testing, intersection-union tests) are discussed in this paper, and the gene profiling methodology is applied to our motivating stem-cell experiment.","inCitations":["63d8cb840af8959f8ce97550be6641ecba1c51ba","14a511b8963ece5e94e972ed1671626d6872bb71","8a97d896e136952ef4e1db5ce0bfced18dcd2238","195b639543102225932edc24005da22400726455","03546fe0fb1a6087165b8d8af6ace435a58dd43a","bcd308b1950fa8a2b001e9714381810b56028c88","05a2e5eb8025a147087bb57ac5ae00464dab6d90","58c1a47fa1702007fcd257ec0d5f62c7fea55275","ea0378ffb312a69f227f3e1310ead5cf0fdb63da","1bc32de9359b06d3d836ebbb61895b610ce4b5b4","2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c"],"title":"Gene profiling for determining pluripotent genes in a time course microarray experiment.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn017"}

Each has a multilocus extension but under neither extension is the sampling distribution available in closed-form, and their computation is extremely difficult. In this paper we derive two new multilocus population genetic models, one a diffusion and the other a coalescent process, which are much simpler than the standard models, but which capture their key properties for large recombination rates. The diffusion model is based on a central limit theorem for density dependent population processes, and we show that the sampling distribution is a linear combination of moments of Gaussian distributions and hence available in closed-form. The coalescent process is based on a probabilistic coupling of the ancestral recombination graph to a simpler genealogical process which exposes the leading dynamics of the former. We further demonstrate that when we consider the sampling distribution as an asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of the recombination parameter, the sampling distributions of the new models agree with the standard ones up to the first two orders.","inCitations":["9c44002988969e9a6babdfa787f6ea741e600465","cb7fa1c0f5ccbd04c6b5ae3bf050bf0f5283e8ff","2fe8f73d3499e6b83e3dcd27ab7f372d39142f61","8e732259ccec5dbb20aba312e95599b74bd4def0"],"title":"Tractable Diffusion and Coalescent Processes for Weakly Correlated Loci.","doi":"10.1214/EJP.v20-3564"}

This criterion is widely discussed in textbooks and is often mentioned in empirical papers. At the same time, it is well known through both important examples and elementary theory that a treatment may cause dramatic effects with no dose-response relationship, and hidden biases may produce a dose-response relationship when the treatment is without effect. What does a dose-response relationship say about causality? It is observed here that a dose-response relationship may or may not reduce sensitivity to hidden bias, and whether it has or has not can be determined by a suitable analysis using the data at hand. Moreover, a study without a dose-response relationship may or may not be less sensitive to hidden bias than another study with such a relationship, and this, too, can be determined from the data at hand. An example concerning cytogenetic damage among professional painters is used to illustrate.","inCitations":["20d3829d2c644a47399ebbd8f1e38e7d94b80356","92dc505116393a856a38cbde5e02cbdc5e6136c6","8d6625b5d16f30dc70496bee4aee96de3838a905","1999558606bbd24407fd20f3821f72d2a60df0ed","1cd3f3c18f69f7197c50f430a7a41ede98652771","9a05c672e56451ff6346dc2de7279e39de574740","e374fd90a0bc4b838a835ec4a6dec891aaa9d73e","c7f3781f9679ad66471d2e5ff46e5bc129b749aa","44580ac1d4ce5e5cc9cf726836b7d69ded7bcb21","fe8d370ae5f738e1e6d5cbc9a59556deefaf350d","8617baf2066860610133ab7553d25086955e2cae","1c08ed2e886a6f6f6b74e0eea5606cd1d1d7bbb9","ad552d409d3aa0ba5dd276f7914426b648c826a6","031513814c9fe270f74f853df290aee9eb34e816","1793f31e67f37797ae7f5dc0dcf2763bd1bfa7fd"],"title":"Does a dose-response relationship reduce sensitivity to hidden bias?","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.1.1"}

The biological interpretation is often complicated by the statistical instability of the obtained gene lists, which may partly be due to the functional redundancy among genes, implying that multiple genes can play exchangeable roles in the cell. In this paper, we use the concept of exchangeability of random variables to model this functional redundancy and thereby account for the instability. We present a flexible framework to incorporate the exchangeability into the representation of lists. The proposed framework supports straightforward comparison between any 2 lists. It can also be used to generate new more stable gene rankings incorporating more information from the experimental data. Using 2 microarray data sets, we show that the proposed method provides more robust gene rankings than existing methods with respect to sampling variations, without compromising the biological significance of the rankings.","inCitations":["cf216fcd4cf537e53b9ed4f46e59c445e845cfc5","fe88308887b5acef8d7853be42ec46558d613e77","4a5d51618ab643b9c33ff6eca2fde403bf27226f","dd8b9c85ef08e818ce57adfae1cf7b3f6ac9fffb","82c34c84f3f58c3cb6b4e125db6213df6e9b992d"],"title":"A framework for list representation, enabling list stabilization through incorporation of gene exchangeabilities.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr023"}

The idea is to base inference on the posterior distribution obtained by multiplying a profiled penalized log-likelihood by a prior for the parametric component, where the profiling and penalization are applied to the nuisance parameter. Because the prior is not applied to the full likelihood, the method is not strictly Bayesian. A benefit of this approximately Bayesian method is that it circumvents the need to put a prior on the possibly infinite-dimensional nuisance components of the model. We investigate the first and second order frequentist performance of the penalized profile sampler, and demonstrate that the accuracy of the procedure can be adjusted by the size of the assigned smoothing parameter. The theoretical validity of the procedure is illustrated for two examples: a partly linear model with normal error for current status data and a semiparametric logistic regression model.

When fitting regressions for such data, one needs to account for spatial dependence to ensure reliable inference for the regression coefficients. The two most commonly used regression models for spatially aggregated data are the automodel and the areal generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). These models induce spatial dependence in different ways but share the smoothing approach, which is intuitive but problematic. This article develops a new regression model for areal data. The new model is called copCAR because it is copula-based and employs the areal GLMM's conditional autoregression (CAR). copCAR overcomes many of the drawbacks of the automodel and the areal GLMM. Specifically, copCAR (1) is flexible and intuitive, (2) permits positive spatial dependence for all types of data, (3) permits efficient computation, and (4) provides reliable spatial regression inference and information about dependence strength. An implementation is provided by R package copCAR, which is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, and supplementary materials are available online.","inCitations":["0d71a7724ec31aa45edcdf16e37ebfa358dd94f9","f09557729a65cd87b8bbfd0950125063e06b97da","cc1730be7f668ad7fd2ee463993be6c408e615bd","5ff7f6d483ec780530f2699e8129f6fdb669f69a","b094a06f252af96a8d040a04f2ac4011c901dc19","cd3e3ee3a88d8c96784756658b85bce664533f9c","9632eb436828705885ba5d1129304b84a702c63f","b0719b7b23e42d8fac793db127690b954976bcc0","423a4c6fee34f31cc562995548e447595d017dd9","cff3ec4ef1c57957963ee4baa9b2438f3a3384fa"],"title":"copCAR: A Flexible Regression Model for Areal Data.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2014.948178"}

These approaches are compared head-to-head for clinical trial situations in rare diseases. Specifically, we consider 3 case studies of rare diseases (Lyell disease, adult-onset Still disease, and cystic fibrosis) with the aim to plan the sample size for an upcoming clinical trial. We outline in detail the reasonable choice of parameters for these approaches for each of the 3 case studies and calculate sample sizes. We stress that the influence of the input parameters needs to be investigated in all approaches and recommend investigating different sample size approaches before deciding finally on the trial size. Highly influencing for the sample size are choice of treatment effect parameter in all approaches and the parameter for the additional cost of the new treatment in the decision-theoretic approach. These should therefore be discussed extensively.","inCitations":["6630be19015861ec62ec9ce13e5113827c68669b","620a3db87e6f12c7fe83a349e308cd364819e0a8","65f48a042071b9218d301fe2da27139361f39669","361a73aaf2450dae292dd1dd1497216362745336"],"title":"Approaches to sample size calculation for clinical trials in rare diseases.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1848"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Computer Science"],"year":2012,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of statistical software","paperAbstract":"Many high-throughput biological data analyses require the calculation of large correlation matrices and/or clustering of a large number of objects. The standard R function for calculating Pearson correlation can handle calculations without missing values efficiently, but is inefficient when applied to data sets with a relatively small number of missing data. We present an implementation of Pearson correlation calculation that can lead to substantial speedup on data with relatively small number of missing entries. Further, we parallelize all calculations and thus achieve further speedup on systems where parallel processing is available. A robust correlation measure, the biweight midcorrelation, is implemented in a similar manner and provides comparable speed. The functions cor and bicor for fast Pearson and biweight midcorrelation, respectively, are part of the updated, freely available R package WGCNA.The hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in R function hclust is an order n(3) (n is the number of clustered objects) version of a publicly available clustering algorithm (Murtagh 2012). We present the package flashClust that implements the original algorithm which in practice achieves order approximately n(2), leading to substantial time savings when clustering large data

We extend both the conventional random effects model and the saturated covariance model for univariate cross-over data to repeated measures cross-over (RMC) data; the resulting models we call the RMC model and Saturated model, respectively. Furthermore, we consider a random effects model for repeated measures cross-over data previously proposed in the literature. We assess the standard errors of point estimates and the coverage properties of confidence intervals for treatment contrasts under the various models. Our findings suggest: (i) Point estimates of treatment contrasts from all models considered are similar; (ii) Confidence intervals for treatment contrasts under the random effects model previously proposed in the literature do not have adequate coverage properties; the model therefore cannot be recommended for analysis of marginal QT prolongation; (iii) The RMC model and the Saturated model have similar precision and coverage properties; both models are suitable for assessment of marginal QT prolongation; and (iv) The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is not a reliable criterion for selecting a covariance model for RMC data in the following sense: the model with the smallest AIC is not necessarily associated with the highest precision for the treatment contrasts, even if the model with the smallest AIC value is also the most parsimonious model.","inCitations":["dff4d13fb4b10fd2e8b212e667f5021a4150b925","604c50e7bafffbc3cbea056c5ac2bea9a1a8b0d9","114c911eb669955376ee32f11dd74dcb9fbbeee8","066f67510fdbcd2464145751b978594fd237cb4e","f9b4e64b8f47e373655a10ef209981aa13c47f4a","21e0acbf9d02e189f13dc71e19a927ad667455da"],"title":"Mixed models for data from thorough QT studies: part 1. assessment of marginal QT prolongation.","doi":"10.1002/pst.463"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2005,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"Here we develop a completely nonparametric method for comparing two groups on a set of longitudinal measurements. No assumptions are made about the form of the mean response function, the covariance structure or the distributional form of disturbances around the mean response function. The solution proposed here is based on the realization that every longitudinal data set can also be thought of as a collection of survival data sets where the events of interest are level crossings. The method for testing for differences in the longitudinal measurements then is as follows: for an arbitrarily large set of levels, for each subject determine the first time the subject has an upcrossing and a downcrossing for each level. For each level one then computes the log rank statistic and uses the maximum in absolute value of all these statistics as the test statistic. By permuting group labels we obtain a permutation test of the hypothesis that the joint distribution of the measurements over time does not depend on group membership. Simulations are performed to investigate the power and it is applied to the area that motivated the method-the analysis of microarrays. In this area small sample sizes, few time points and far too many genes to consider genuine gene level longitudinal modeling have created a need for a simple, model free test to screen for interesting features in the data.","inCitations":["01e8de4748577f23623e5c0defb711cca81fb656"],"title":"A nonparametric approach to the analysis of longitudinal data via a set of level crossing problems with application to the analysis of microarray time course experiments.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi008"}
