In this paper, we develop a framework to assess and compute the long-term impact of different strategies to perform subgroup analysis. We propose two performance measures: the average gain for patients in the future (E) and the probability of recommending a change to a worse treatment at individual patient level (P). Five families of decision rules are applied under different assumptions for the individual treatment effect (TE) variation. Three distributions reflecting optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios are assumed for true treatment effects across studies. This framework allows us to compare subgroup analyses decision rules, and we demonstrate through simulation studies that there are decision rules for subgroup analysis which can decrease P and increase E simultaneously compared to the situation of no subgroup analysis. These rules are much more liberal than the usual superiority testing. The latter typically implies a dramatic decrease in E.","inCitations":["d92d499d748724eb8e067fe10671961a82226cd5","18ea35164496fbe528751a52ef77eee9840d0668"],"title":"A framework to assess the value of subgroup analyses when the overall treatment effect is significant.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1052484"}

Under the current process of islet distribution for basic science experimentation nationwide, specialized laboratories attempt to distribute islets to one or more scientists based on a list of known investigators. This Local Decision Making (LDM) process has been found to be ineffective and suboptimal. To alleviate these problems, a computerized Matching Algorithm for Islet Distribution (MAID) was developed to better match the functional, morphological, and quality characteristics of islet preparations to the criteria desired by basic research laboratories, i.e. requesters. The algorithm searches for an optimal combination of requesters using detailed screening, sorting, and search procedures. When applied to a data set of 68 human islet preparations distributed by the Islet Cell Resource (ICR) Center Consortium, MAID reduced the number of requesters that a) did not receive any islets, and b) received mis-matched shipments. These results suggest that MAID is an improved more efficient approach to the centralized distribution of human islets within a consortium setting.","inCitations":["56a11a65fd4ae12513a3d56e23dadbd53bdd1b87","3ce905d96938ca2492a4a0f22c2cd975d4e6e702","4b98ef045272a07669e84c6d5b384a0412041f94","b117b550d1ff7e970f992228d3dcdb887702e6b5","04b2f3581b5df630216bdc99e844825001b841bc"],"title":"A matching algorithm for the distribution of human pancreatic islets","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2007.02.030"}

However, as study size grows, the manual evaluation of these assays becomes a prohibitive limitation; it vastly reduces throughput and greatly increases variability and expense. We propose an algorithm-Tissue Array Co-Occurrence Matrix Analysis (TACOMA)-for quantifying cellular phenotypes based on textural regularity summarized by local inter-pixel relationships. The algorithm can be easily trained for any staining pattern, is absent of sensitive tuning parameters and has the ability to report salient pixels in an image that contribute to its score. Pathologists' input via informative training patches is an important aspect of the algorithm that allows the training for any specific marker or cell type. With co-training, the error rate of TACOMA can be reduced substantially for a very small training sample (e.g., with size 30). We give theoretical insights into the success of co-training via thinning of the feature set in a high dimensional setting when there is \"sufficient\" redundancy among the features. TACOMA is flexible, transparent and provides a scoring process that can be evaluated with clarity and confidence. In a study based on an estrogen receptor (ER) marker, we show that TACOMA is comparable to, or outperforms, pathologists' performance in terms of accuracy and repeatability.","inCitations":["4a32929dbc801a7e96e900f42f242f93057211ab","42b8996eab8736571f62318221d469c6405e7f25","45567b10b35c38c8f7d44a7557a6d47dd1f195fa","d7dc2aa8233641a522a9fb51d936af416206edd1"],"title":"Statistical Methods for Tissue Array Images - Algorithmic Scoring and Co-training.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS543"}

Several authors proposed extensions of the proportional hazard model for regression analysis of these processes. In this paper, we consider a general class of censored semi-Markov and modulated renewal processes and propose use of transformation models for their analysis. Special cases include modulated renewal processes with interarrival times specified using transformation models, and semi-Markov processes with with one-step transition probabilities defined using copula-transformation models. We discuss estimation of finite and infinite dimensional parameters and develop an extension of the Gaussian multiplier method for setting confidence bands for transition probabilities and related parameters.

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Air pollution epidemiology studies are trending towards a multi-pollutant approach. In these studies, exposures at subject locations are unobserved and must be predicted using observed exposures at misaligned monitoring locations. This induces measurement error, which can bias the estimated health effects and affect standard error estimates. We characterize this measurement error and develop an analytic bias correction when using penalized regression splines to predict exposure. Our simulations show bias from multi-pollutant measurement error can be severe, and in opposite directions or simultaneously positive or negative. Our analytic bias correction combined with a non-parametric bootstrap yields accurate coverage of 95% confidence intervals. We apply our methodology to analyze the association of systolic blood pressure with PM2.5 and NO2 in the NIEHS Sister Study. We find that NO2 confounds the association of systolic blood pressure with PM2.5 and vice versa. Elevated systolic blood pressure was significantly associated with increased PM2.5 and decreased NO2. Correcting for measurement error bias strengthened these associations and widened 95% confidence intervals.","inCitations":["b6421d926cd932a5eb3bbf55ee59a9bfef7cf75a","59d8b667181ea4120bb0bde8cda523e6b315c66c","6fc7e34a27c06c2c4f1964ff97bfa051478e392c","cdb888a7e75e76adc3e20bfd01ae8a4d12ac48fa","f89ec810fe487427c6decc7f0f9ad5ebb557c5a8","1de694f82edf2d85d181baea8b37bcf895178b52"],"title":"Multipollutant measurement error in air pollution epidemiology studies arising from predicting exposures with penalized regression splines.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12144"}

A general methodology for adaptive designs is based on the combination testing principle. Using this principle, selection of treatment arms in multi-armed designs, recalculation of sample size, and more general data-driven changes to the design are possible without undermining type I error control. In this paper we consider aspects related to the sample size determination for multi-armed designs. We assess sample size calculations that are based on ad hoc formulas such as the Bonferroni correction. An important aspect will be the choice of the control group sample size. We further consider the weighting scheme in the combination testing approach. Our assessment is restricted to two-stage designs. In general, simulation tools will be necessary to assess the statistical properties of these designs.","inCitations":["9b2a1097244f1f8e48c2db4e063c69bffbb652ca","2acc2be12d6447d1c3df6430fc93c46d81593a16","b12201f5d03d3630a02b0ce656d9a4b666d5739c","f0338fe33d9150ef38ed40ef76ace66909b15a29","043b3543f7a7f5508d9b507c9e28592a049be9e9","780d6967d94b56acf13a409d53dc55a561adb055","1021e30777bd8c5ca820b3af362983d498bb2e38","7208a0c4ab5e65c1ffa168dca813fdba28378968","ec85d93990f5bdf41e01c207162c4848e88b32ca"],"title":"On sample size determination in multi-armed confirmatory adaptive designs.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.551336"}

SupCP generalizes the supervised singular value decomposition (SupSVD) for vector-valued observations, to allow for observations that have the form of a matrix or higher-order array. Such data are increasingly encountered in biomedical research and other fields. We use a novel likelihood-based latent variable representation of the CP factorization, in which the latent variables are informed by additional covariates. We give conditions for identifiability, and develop an EM algorithm for simultaneous estimation of all model parameters. SupCP can be used for dimension reduction, capturing latent structures that are more accurate and interpretable due to covariate supervision. Moreover, SupCP specifies a full probability distribution for a multiway data observation with given covariate values, which can be used for predictive modeling. We conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate the SupCP algorithm. We apply it to a facial image database with facial descriptors (e.g., smiling / not smiling) as covariates, and to a study of amino acid fluorescence.

In juvenile toxicity studies, it is of interest to test whether dosing juvenile rats with some compound of interest has an effect on its learning ability. The traditional analysis uses non-parametric tests to check for a possible dose-effect. However, due to the many tests performed, this approach lacks power.

In many applications, there exists variation in cyclical patterns from time series in the same group. Although a number of frequency domain methods for the discriminant analysis of time series have been explored, there is a dearth of models and methods that account for within-group spectral variability. This article proposes a model for groups of time series in which transfer functions are modeled as stochastic variables that can account for both between-group and within-group differences in spectra that are identified from individual replicates. An ensuing discriminant analysis of stochastic cepstra under this model is developed to obtain parsimonious measures of relative power that optimally separate groups in the presence of within-group spectral variability. The approach possess favorable properties in classifying new observations and can be consistently estimated through a simple discriminant analysis of a finite number of estimated cepstral coefficients. Benefits in accounting for within-group spectral variability are empirically illustrated in a simulation study and through an analysis of gait variability.","inCitations":["fd4f420c6fac2b29670962e80f1e0a59237debec","6ddfb4e63057ccea1a989dc1c5804986644a060a","dc1e6aef05128658a8074d2ed2ae4d83f1e9661f","d99437de9821c819ce1dd752220f663c1f56a8ae","962ea45576c07b33e90fcd0694c07d5d40e487d7"],"title":"Discriminant Analysis of Time Series in the Presence of Within-Group Spectral Variability.","doi":"10.1111/jtsa.12166"}

Various blinded sample size re-estimation procedures have been proposed in the literature. We compare the blinded sample size re-estimation procedures based on the one-sample variance of the pooled data with a blinded procedure using the randomization block information with respect to bias and variance of the variance estimators, and the distribution of the resulting sample sizes, power, and actual type I error rate. For reference, sample size re-estimation based on the unblinded variance is also included in the comparison. It is shown that using an unbiased variance estimator (such as the one using the randomization block information) for sample size re-estimation does not guarantee that the desired power is achieved. Moreover, in situations that are common in clinical trials, the variance estimator that employs the randomization block length shows a higher variability than the simple one-sample estimator and in turn the sample size resulting from the related re-estimation procedure. This higher variability can lead to a lower power as was demonstrated in the setting of noninferiority trials. In summary, the one-sample estimator obtained from the pooled data is extremely simple to apply, shows good performance, and is therefore recommended for application.","inCitations":["090e6c9926263ba0563f37609187801e257fc229","4b2fbafae462d72b25c4366c5bd529eeaefae10c","efa607355f8e7018ecdced210f5563b51dd49746","f51b5cf45958620f3f24068e9e80415a5504295a","c72a87cf47beb86fcb9c28b1df8a52bd581455d2","c770771615b1942c8beaf2c80ebdf6b5a53a6267","3cbda64520da291972e0a4026840d1dfc9c1f625","b366ac9148c1a9492e3f7ef5485abbe35e435197","fe33fa77a0cf3a9cc99a0681db97bce97786dec0","2f3f2b45b460729de966bc881dba42dc2ced15b3","eaf6cee68a06d219e0559209082654f714d9cb66","7283608b9b354c36fa3e2535df5de8dca4921357"],"title":"Blinded sample size re-estimation in superiority and noninferiority trials: bias versus variance in variance estimation.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1564"}

Partially identified models can arise, whereby the identification region for a target parameter -- the set of values consistent with the law of the observable data -- is strictly contained in the set of a priori plausible values, but strictly contains the single true value. The first part of this paper reviews the use of Bayesian inference in partially identified models, and describes the large-sample limit of the posterior distribution over the target parameter. This limiting distribution will have the identification region as its support. The second part of the paper focuses on the informativeness of the shape of the limiting distribution. This provides a point of departure with non-Bayesian approaches, since they focus on inferring the identification region without attempting to speak to relative plausibilities of values inside the identification region. The utility of the shape is investigated in several partially identified models.","inCitations":["c12f019b36c8f8bad5b4589159ccad1ce0ede75e","ced00874ef747a4f688cea767669d350006c3fdc","a7da18eb7ce882673d6383ac51d64e9fd7444b64","cb98d3e0c8bf66feff20d6eea0644d29f187dcec","78d6cf71f20ca359680175369fb755be8c218de4","8c3ce99f1cf689a8c945ebaee21de155783edb84","e58332f9a11f9e031e601eb2f987ef6d9086854d","0e00b8e08ccccb1a33ff48f8fa767472a3bfad50","8f5c257cd64a413a2e0e17ae1f008310bc7b8799","e329dbe9ca09e8f43e3a26a7775453f164a1950e","66e981325b3a012e1c790cbb6dffef0f95ffb5a9","f7d353a38b1d02a32818d55d652ef098cf9fade1","898392324563169d97e9fc1dd33db35e08694c56","11c8e4339fddc4795ff65216844fea34fdda6c29","2ae372a5d9726376d06c67339db4a0670abfd532","16c1f36fcbf1abb32664f7c6aae7e6c2651d3ed3","5829fcb7cfc721ade878361435d241e72d5ee954","4f08f4786039e82b0157282ab24b3164c91a9a3a","889a7d7fe03be4521cd08c2fbff42cc90fa724d9","97dd184a504266b4baf037a43ca473ab0b5fa584","a2fec2b86ac0b4b65d4b64d097c41e341d7b94eb","c3ade5ca2ba2181d950860e617c16028869d0595","6dcf116f580ad8111c94ddb902f99dde7209c5a4","d22e488a4ea5f422b9269eb3cfc78e7102102be2"],"title":"Bayesian Inference for Partially Identified Models","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1206"}

To assess covariate effects on the gaps between consecutive recurrent events, the Cox proportional hazards model is frequently employed in data analysis. The validity of statistical inference, however, depends on the appropriateness of the Cox model. In this paper, we propose a class of graphical techniques and formal tests for checking the Cox model with recurrent gap time data. The building block of our model checking method is an averaged martingale-like process, based on which a class of multiparameter stochastic processes is proposed. This maneuver is very general and can be used to assess different aspects of model fit. Numerical simulations are conducted to examine finite-sample performance, and the proposed model checking techniques are illustrated with data from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register.","inCitations":["4ee8fa52fa9d0e49334b1397d2fed594bdd585a0","80a63981e4185480b53d59c22a826cea57765653","21ed1195af6dd204181040cd4d44cd93783de566","5136205a80b20c04b5a4c3155365b6abae337a41","72627846394f415a96578f83d68aab75ca03e9df"],"title":"A model checking method for the proportional hazards model with recurrent gap time data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq071"}

The model's starting point is the linear congeneric model for item scores, but it takes into account the bounded nature of the item responses and assumes that their conditional distributions for a fixed trait level are truncated normal. This assumption leads to nonlinear item-trait regressions and considerably modifies some aspects of the linear model. The linear model is considered as an approximation to the modified version, and an interval is defined in which the approximation is satisfactory. Procedures for estimating the item and subject parameters are described. The applicability of the model is illustrated using real data.","inCitations":["1cf5111d321a5d75f2e6a688d6796a71b0be1407","b3231bd27eac11f3085cb1425835d04238d5f796","2f56f3fcc2265ade75b73d8565dc94ea0abc6751","d1f4a3b527897c3deb264f469f3693fc9c09806b"],"title":"A nonlinear congeneric model for continuous item responses.","doi":"10.1348/000711001159573"}

However, there are still debates if switching between a biosimilar and its reference product influences the efficacy of the treatment. In this paper, we address this uncertainty by developing a formal statistical test that can be used for showing that switching has no negative impact on the efficacy of biosimilars. For that, we first introduce a linear mixed-effects model that is used for defining the null hypothesis (switching influences the efficacy) and the alternative hypothesis (switching has no influence on the efficacy). Using this as the foundation of our work, we propose several approaches for testing for changes in the efficacy of the treatment due to switching and discuss the properties of these tests in an extensive simulation study. It is shown that all these methods have advantages and disadvantages and the decision regarding which method is preferred depends on the expectation of a switching assessment. To demonstrate the applicability of the methods in practice, the approaches were applied to the data of the EGALITY study, which compares the reference product Enbrel® (Amgen) with the approved biosimilar Erelzi® (Sandoz).","inCitations":["446fbea6556992dc67d3b647dc785a2a82c47beb"],"title":"Longitudinal assessment of the impact of multiple switches between a biosimilar and its reference product on efficacy parameters.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1849"}

A basic problem in such experiments is to estimate the nominal expression levels of a large number of genes. Pooling samples will affect expression estimation, but the exact effects are not yet known as the approach has not been systematically studied in this context. We consider how mRNA pooling affects expression estimates by assessing the finite-sample performance of different estimators for designs with and without pooling. Conditions under which it is advantageous to pool mRNA are defined; and general properties of estimates from both pooled and non-pooled designs are derived under these conditions. A formula is given for the total number of subjects and arrays required in a pooled experiment to obtain gene expression estimates and confidence intervals comparable to those obtained from the no-pooling case. The formula demonstrates that by pooling a perhaps increased number of subjects, one can decrease the number of arrays required in an experiment without a loss of precision. The assumptions that facilitate derivation of this formula are considered using data from a quantitative real-time PCR experiment. The calculations are not specific to one particular method of quantifying gene expression as they assume only that a single, normalized, estimate of expression is obtained for each gene.

The conceptual problem with this approach is that such a two-stage process makes both the power and the significance of the entire procedure uncertain, as type I and type II errors are possible at both stages. A type I error at the first stage, for example, will obviously increase the probability of a type II error at the second stage. Based on the idea of Schmider et al. (2010), which proposes that simulated sets of sample data be ranked with respect to their degree of normality, this paper investigates the relationship between population non-normality and sample non-normality with respect to the performance of the ANOVA, Brown-Forsythe test, Welch test, and Kruskal-Wallis test when used with different distributions, sample sizes, and effect sizes. The overall conclusion is that the Kruskal-Wallis test is considerably less sensitive to the degree of sample normality when populations are distinctly non-normal and should therefore be the primary tool used to compare locations when it is known that populations are not at least approximately normal.","inCitations":["52cb2ba167be9e79550ad150465f49763bcc77e1","4282890ae04444a973584aacb6548a4b00cec9f2","48f5b6519a1f443f9a9cb00378606e6e09a7f14c","e64a1497fc39e60babe38671460ed9ef065b3e46","0d916484490d2997ede67541b2e4e70b963d764b","341d11c90ca6327a7a50403a49d06f9336758f4e","14600da9a3a682aabee97ce3aa991bbc194b801e","b0249f00f166f2d0a3bd6ef24a9cc62e7bc18575","49bba4c6f031124ec9cb56545041491b8e5e3397","ad92ca1a5b7c160094ccba6ed1715411ee28ff5f","96b643d38430834ac0897abb9221f8a19e2dcb1d","ab900b3994f27138d9940daaf250f52f81991a54","f9752b51fcd41b9ef4ad1d1e0d054d00fef2e89d","359ff4404a004d9caf139b87c09ffaf69bfec9f2","a8161c313b4a626be465043453cfd996cf239c2b","6d682d3cedfcca783602770ed4b54bf396de2db1","38780be49db8db9945cb87841024a1b60667ebf4","e06f9577a269c1d21d953530e6a69122a61ca55c","1802e863c279115ba4489462176df12c4e9cf870","d2059466387d5e44567f13398a88573cbd86184f","2c6f24961f0889328f39a0ede1e9424b25e5ea40","2297dd8fcbf375c3d044b017c32608dfe3729035","99d80f38967f82a580c4edcea0a43758d6f0b8a5","b054a535dbd7467c11db364182d8bf6575059077","659902860d788199acacd087db8d0df26563ebee","c7d5e7fe442e2d8f9a0238a7a640f71ed85c6502","6df5ae3312d08570785516a3b39e575249925a4e","ea225568ed3d4a61643b59c99ab5c94af46e61f5","0d591c0526b223059c06732e360bd2e6f632a107","9fa4f4e3f4fa4390f81b0ce6be981ee7841f42f2","d3876d24cfa91d828576e32308b9a72715d24f9e","aaa1d4f43fc78cb0014d9c0ccdb82c50b89cbdf9","636f1fb78565f21d914c35d5026706267caa2ab1","93165053499dc35d78b06fcf75b7e89f618cd4f1"],"title":"The impact of sample non-normality on ANOVA and alternative methods.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02047.x"}

Most post-marketing detection of adverse drug reaction (ADR) relies on physicians' spontaneous reports, leading to under-reporting. To take up this challenge, we develop a scalable model to estimate the effect of multiple longitudinal features (drug exposures) on a rare longitudinal outcome. Our procedure is based on a conditional Poisson regression model also known as self-controlled case series (SCCS). To overcome the need of precise risk periods specification, we model the intensity of outcomes using a convolution between exposures and step functions, which are penalized using a combination of group-Lasso and total-variation. Up to our knowledge, this is the first SCCS model with flexible intensity able to handle multiple longitudinal features in a single model. We show that this approach improves the state-of-the-art in terms of mean absolute error and computation time for the estimation of relative risks on simulated data. We apply this method on an ADR detection problem, using a cohort of diabetic patients extracted from the large French national health insurance database (SNIIRAM), a claims database containing medical reimbursements of more than 53 million people. This work has been done in the context of a research partnership between Ecole Polytechnique and CNAMTS (in charge of SNIIRAM).","inCitations":["925b06202d8525f58c46402dae486e5be5c6394a","ca7e071b7218058a9f4531b6a428cecb0d39eb0f","59fcc32179496750a687e4c0e2764968addd5ee4","10e700d0a45a3dd4d4bd3e1710ecf0c2c7a27b32"],"title":"ConvSCCS: convolutional self-controlled case series model for lagged adverse event detection.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz003"}

The package aims to provide a flexible tool for simplifying the conduct of transparent and reproducible simulation studies, with a particular emphasis on the types of data and interventions frequently encountered in real-world causal inference problems, such as, observational data with time-dependent confounding, selection bias, and random monitoring processes. The package interface allows for concise expression of complex functional dependencies between a large number of nodes, where each node may represent a measurement at a specific time point. The package allows for specification and simulation of counterfactual data under various user-specified interventions (e.g., static, dynamic, deterministic, or stochastic). In particular, the interventions may represent exposures to treatment regimens, the occurrence or non-occurrence of right-censoring events, or of clinical monitoring events. Finally, the package enables the computation of a selected set of user-specified features of the distribution of the counterfactual data that represent common causal quantities of interest, such as, treatment-specific means, the average treatment effects and coefficients from working marginal structural models. The applicability of simcausal is demonstrated by replicating the results of two published simulation studies.","inCitations":["2b897042a1177ce88a26329562aef9e588072118","0f17e391e6480631b99cbfdb016f443749d58469","9d1297f833c31bc679c0577e4b186e349b100d6a","11ef682754addddc04d44e9934a9323b83d9e5db"],"title":"simcausal R Package: Conducting Transparent and Reproducible Simulation Studies of Causal Effect Estimation with Complex Longitudinal Data.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v081.i02"}

In this situation, the structural mean model (SMM) approach focuses on the average treatment effect among patients actually treated (ATT). In contrast, the principal stratification (PS) approach addresses the effect on a certain subgroup defined by latent compliance behavior. While these approaches target different causal effects, the estimators have the same form as the classical instrumental variable estimator, under the assumption of no effect modification (NEM) and monotonic selection. In this article, we clarify the relation between SMM and PS under the monotonic selection assumption. Specifically, we translate the NEM assumption for the SMM estimator into the words of the PS approach. Then, we propose a new bound for the ATT by making a possibly more plausible assumption than the NEM assumption based on the PS approach. Furthermore, we extend these results to the average treatment effect for the entire population. The proposed bounds are illustrated with applications to a real clinical trial data. Although our assumption cannot be empirically verified, the proposed bounds can be considerably tighter than those previously proposed.","inCitations":["a948b707009e13ea0e4a05c69f1680cbc72c8694"],"title":"Instruments and Bounds for Causal Effects under the Monotonic Selection Assumption","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1386"}

Motivated by the need for novel study designs with better estimation efficiency and reduced study cost, we consider a biased sampling scheme that consists of a SRC and a supplemental TDC. Using this approach, investigators can oversample or undersample subjects falling into certain regions of the biomarker measure, yielding improved precision for the estimation of the ROC curve with a fixed sample size. Test-result-dependent sampling will introduce bias in estimating the predictive accuracy of the biomarker if standard ROC estimation methods are used. In this article, we discuss three approaches for analyzing data of a test-result-dependent structure with a special focus on the empirical likelihood method. We establish asymptotic properties of the empirical likelihood estimators for covariate-specific ROC curves and covariate-independent ROC curves and give their corresponding variance estimators. Simulation studies show that the empirical likelihood method yields good properties and is more efficient than alternative methods.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2018,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The general topic of subgroup identification has attracted much attention in the clinical trial literature due to its important role in the development of tailored therapies and personalized medicine. Subgroup search methods are commonly used in late-phase clinical trials to identify subsets of the trial population with certain desirable characteristics. Post-hoc or exploratory subgroup exploration has been criticized for being extremely unreliable. Principled approaches to exploratory subgroup analysis based on recent advances in machine learning and data mining have been developed to address this criticism. These approaches emphasize fundamental statistical principles, including the importance of performing multiplicity adjustments to account for selection bias inherent in subgroup search. This article provides a detailed review of multiplicity issues arising in exploratory subgroup analysis. Multiplicity corrections in the context of principled subgroup search will be illustrated using the family of SIDES (subgroup identification based on differential effect search) methods. A case study based on a Phase III oncology trial will be presented to discuss the details of subgroup search algorithms with resampling-based multiplicity adjustment procedures.","inCitations":["3ba3de961d6d9a3b8d512cbf2487f1bcad025919","18fcd13fbc3f1f4c5559c7cbbfd0c0cf268af727"],"title":"Multiplicity issues in exploratory subgroup analysis.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1397009"}

Demonstrating switchability between rhGH products is challenging because the process of growth varies with the age of the child and across children. The first modelling approach aims at predicting individual height measured at several time-points after switching to the biosimilar. The second modelling approach provides an estimate of the deviation from the overall growth rate after switching to the biosimilar, which can be regarded as an estimate of switchability. The results after applying these approaches to data from a randomized clinical trial are presented. The accuracy and precision of the predictions made using the first approach and the small deviation from switchability estimated with the second approach provide sufficient evidence to conclude that switching from Genotropin(®) to Omnitrope(®) has a very small effect on growth, which is neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant.","inCitations":["446fbea6556992dc67d3b647dc785a2a82c47beb","355a10ad50ea30684e467390bc2bb4157c861dbb","ee64a25dcac316216b6c0915239000b182382966","3485c87ea4c014b50e93759f1e9f021421a083d6"],"title":"Assessing switchability for biosimilar products: modelling approaches applied to children's growth.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1691"}

Markov process models provide a useful tool describing disease progression for life history data. The literature mainly focuses on time homogeneous process. In this paper we develop methods to deal with non-homogeneous Markov process with incomplete clustered life history data. A correlated random effects model is developed to deal with the nonignorable missingness, and a time transformation is employed to address the non-homogeneity in the transition model. Maximum likelihood estimate based on the Monte-Carlo EM algorithm is advocated for parameter estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method works well in many situations.

We develop a hybrid Markovian model for neural branching that extends previously published models by (i) using a discretized gamma model to account for underdispersion in primary branching, (ii) incorporating both bifurcation and trifurcation branching events to accommodate observed data, and (iii) only requiring branch counts and not branching topology as observations, allowing larger numbers of neurons to be sampled than in previous literature. Inference for primary branching is achieved through a gamma generalized linear model. Due to incomplete data, bifurcation and trifurcation probabilities are estimated using an expectation-maximization algorithm, which is shown to give consistent estimates using simulation studies and theoretical arguments. In simulation studies, comparison of standard errors shows no significant loss of accuracy relative to when topological information is available. A unified methodology for testing hypotheses using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) is developed. The methodology is applied to an experiment where neurons are cocultured with different treatments: growth factor (GF), hypothalamic-astroglial conditioned medium (HY), and combination. The model provides statistically adequate fit at all branching orders. All treatments cause significantly higher branching at primary and secondary orders relative to control (p-value < 0.01), but not at higher branching orders, suggesting genetic regulation by the treatments. Using a computationally feasible lower bound on the LRT, bifurcation probabilities are shown to decrease exponentially with branching order for all treatments except HY (p-value 0.03).","inCitations":["ed807a3b51bdc5c2cb7054da18b86519fa542297","3c1c20d2bfda6d59443d7f642ef034b4cfbd28d3","3e7c83ad74d9f9d189b68d4c28c12ba1b64e44d7"],"title":"Hypothesis testing for neural cell growth experiments using a hybrid branching process model.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq038"}

Separate models are fitted to the two series (response and discontinuation) to account for covariate and time effects. The serial dependence and the dependence between response and drop-out are also modeled. This is done using particular dependence functions, called copulas. Copulas are used to create a joint distribution with given marginal distributions. Applications are given for the analysis of heart rate/morbidity in toxicology and pain severity/intake of rescue medications in a trial on migraine. Using copulas, the level of dependence between two variables remains invariant to changes in the marginal distribution of either variable. This proves interesting in modeling the association in a longitudinal setting when responses change over time.","inCitations":["3616d59676c3851d9693b262f9f28635fd4806fe","5049f46b62b413c82d2eaedbeea028f09bcb2d5a","0e1bed4979468fc0d1132d0f976a5140d6026c80","d20cef14b2d407132f4c28f4995b0b83a50c67de","549ab5b22a028fcb6d97d2dae6de601eac2adbd2"],"title":"On the joint analysis of longitudinal responses and early discontinuation in randomized trials.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120016228"}

However, the resulting estimates are often biased due to unmeasured confounders, which typically are not available from the standard administrative registries used for these studies. Extra information on confounders can be provided through external data sets such as surveys or cohorts, where the data are available at the individual level rather than at the area level; however, such data typically lack the geographical coverage of administrative registries. We develop a framework of analysis which combines ecological and individual level data from different sources to provide an adjusted estimate of area level risk factors which is less biased. Our method (i) summarizes all available individual level confounders into an area level scalar variable, which we call ecological propensity score (EPS), (ii) implements a hierarchical structured approach to impute the values of EPS whenever they are missing, and (iii) includes the estimated and imputed EPS into the ecological regression linking the risk factors to the health outcome. Through a simulation study, we show that integrating individual level data into small area analyses via EPS is a promising method to reduce the bias intrinsic in ecological studies due to unmeasured confounders; we also apply the method to a real case study to evaluate the effect of air pollution on coronary heart disease hospital admissions in Greater London.","inCitations":["629a4dedd282cc706fbd3fb396982f08d25a79d6"],"title":"Using ecological propensity score to adjust for missing confounders in small area studies","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx058"}
