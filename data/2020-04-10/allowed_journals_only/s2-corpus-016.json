The goal of aCGH analysis is to identify the boundaries of the regions where the number of DNA copies changes (breakpoint identification) and then to label each region as loss, neutral, or gain (calling). In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm, based on the shifting level model (SLM), with the aim of locating regions with different means of the log(2) ratio in genomic profiles obtained from aCGH data. We combine the SLM algorithm with the CGHcall calling procedure and compare their performances with 5 state-of-the-art methods. When dealing with synthetic data, our method outperforms the other 5 algorithms in detecting the change in the number of DNA copies in the most challenging situations. For real aCGH data, SLM is able to locate all the cytogenetically mapped aberrations giving a smaller number of false-positive breakpoints than the compared methods. The application of the SLM algorithm is not limited to aCGH data. Our approach can also be used for the analysis of several emerging experimental strategies such as high-resolution tiling array.","inCitations":["4e65b6fda6624b4c1263b260234e2fc366cef076","7f166f5ccc47666cc0b74389f96508621c6fcc85","f3ff22443f7ccd3990df84d5da25f722790fef2e","e80cecc6e31e4e3dfdcbc7f35923319af3243e54","4974eab03be247d0e8ac4c3405524ed654a4c0ae","0ac8d18810f88ebb025835b75966925e7f2f1a85","c3cef87121763678641e5ccfe135c4b15c83e6eb","ba5ad360e260ec0048a35e8c14747a6232750934","3cf5558b5ac999ba68479a9226bba779ffcbd79d","1fb1d5662dbb2868c262731a80ad80d78ef53dfa","250dad8f9b90114b002f7b7c9851358aeb9401f9","56d3d99e3778b225ebd63aa9b53af58a93cd546f","1a90ccbbe21493f82a22164778d82913764771c2","6f66dc05ce39165507583a21bd9d4a7ba35ce647"],"title":"A shifting level model algorithm that identifies aberrations in array-CGH data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp051"}

A smoothing spline is a nonparametric estimator of a function that is a compromise between the fit to the data and the degree of smoothness and thus provides a flexible way of modelling dose-response data. In conjunction with decision rules for which doses to continue with after an interim analysis, it can be used to give an adaptive way of modelling the relationship between dose and response. We fit smoothing splines using the generalized cross-validation criterion for deciding on the degree of smoothness and we use estimated bootstrap percentiles of the predicted values for each dose to decide upon which doses to continue with after an interim analysis. We compare this approach with a corresponding adaptive analysis of variance approach based upon new simulations of the scenarios previously used by the PhRMA Working Group on Adaptive Dose-Ranging Studies. The results obtained for the adaptive modelling of dose-response data using smoothing splines are mostly comparable with those previously obtained by the PhRMA Working Group for the Bayesian Normal Dynamic Linear model (GADA) procedure. These methods may be useful for carrying out adaptations, detecting dose-response relationships and identifying clinically relevant doses.","inCitations":["dc17509a897b3dfe62731527caf6b461d5a23246","2cceca0f7cecf678994f1293515bc48d3ffacf20","1cb5dd2a6c482f5dd791c1472d6da3e461e5e088"],"title":"Adaptive modelling of dose-response relationships using smoothing splines.","doi":"10.1002/pst.363"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2011,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Two methods of bootstrap resampling are discussed with log-linear models for count data. The first involves the resampling of observations and the second involves the resampling of Pearson residuals taking into account changes in the distribution of residuals associated with the expected values of counts. The use of both methods is illustrated on two data sets; one data set concerns the number of ear infections of swimmers related to whether they are frequent swimmers or not and three other variables, and the other data set concerns the number of visits to a doctor made in the last 2 weeks related to the age of subjects and 10 other variables. A third data set on the number of marine mammal interactions in different years and fishing areas is also used as an example. In this case only the second bootstrap method can be used because the nature of the data allows the bootstrap resampling of observations to produce sets of data that could not have occurred in practice. Simulation results indicate that the bootstrap results are slightly better than the results from a conventional analysis for the first data set, and much better than the results from a conventional analysis for the second data set, but a conventional analysis works well for the third data set while there are problems with bootstrap analyses.","inCitations":["3b706ee05de1168407d4b6172cb8814bb7a4d011"],"title":"Bootstrapping with models for count data.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.607748"}

One distinct feature of Illumina BeadArrays is that each array has thousands of negative control bead types containing oligonucleotide sequences that are not specific to any target genes in the genome. This design provides a way of directly estimating the distribution of the background noise. In the literature of background correction for BeadArray data, the information from negative control beads is either ignored, used in a naive way that can lead to a loss in efficiency, or the noise is assumed to be normally distributed. However, we show with real data that the noise can be skewed. In this study we propose an exponential-gamma convolution model for background correction of Illumina BeadArray data. Using both simulated and real data examples, we show that the proposed method can improve the signal estimation and detection of differentially expressed genes when the signal to noise ratio is large and the noise has a skewed distribution.","inCitations":["8f66e463a386e0db5040df0dfac43c082028d3ec","7c705f7fe5752bf3464b09355f14fe507b3da520","c62ae5438e53c324cf65c90a682208fd51e3ce2f","3b5da822c19b43f1f9684c4a0cff6feaef7e5316","76550192bddbafb5e05d939ede2b69e1b00428b2","be22eb379b133b2393066931b61507659538f88f"],"title":"An Exponential-Gamma Convolution Model for Background Correction of Illumina BeadArray Data.","doi":"10.1080/03610921003797753"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2003,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"Estimating haplotype frequencies becomes increasingly important in the mapping of complex disease genes, as millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are being identified and genotyped. When genotypes at multiple SNP loci are gathered from unrelated individuals, haplotype frequencies can be accurately estimated using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms (Excoffier and Slatkin, 1995; Hawley and Kidd, 1995; Long et al., 1995), with standard errors estimated using bootstraps. However, because the number of possible haplotypes increases exponentially with the number of SNPs, handling data with a large number of SNPs poses a computational challenge for the EM methods and for other haplotype inference methods. To solve this problem, Niu and colleagues, in their Bayesian haplotype inference paper (Niu et al., 2002), introduced a computational algorithm called progressive ligation (PL). But their Bayesian method has a limitation on the number of subjects (no more than 100 subjects in the current implementation of the method). In this paper, we propose a new method in which we use the same likelihood formulation as in Excoffier and Slatkin's EM algorithm and apply the estimating equation idea and the PL computational algorithm with some modifications. Our proposed method can handle data sets with large number of SNPs as well as large numbers of subjects. Simultaneously, our method estimates standard errors efficiently, using the sandwich-estimate from the estimating equation, rather than the bootstrap method. Additionally, our method admits missing data and produces valid estimates of parameters and their standard errors under the assumption that the missing genotypes are missing at random in the sense defined by Rubin (1976).","inCitations":["212b96bbeaa50b23d63ef4755f53e1bc8f664462","a2dd3235f00740ce3035b1b780ca260b59341016","8f034981ade59cbd6300f2469060a8e310c200e9","a4592901cc049a1539a326261557c8044356f6ae","d8cf4777dbff70fc68c4839ee303b0109f69fde5","90ca01a16745c2db9ac2668adb335a37c079fe81","db13508b86b930102a7278b8bc7d103b5c5a18c0","caa17a00e2d9b7329526004b9f694bc0fbdd9b5c","16e63a39152d70a49304e639551760c187dba37d","8c02d0635aefaa044d437ffc8bd991acdc1c53ec","af1adf496561e63e439be310fd9cf251d0b84f64","55954a6754ea9909f418289aa75a2b8a97a93417","c52e9b00227314b2f7801b5bf8734c79c3166d95","815729ba5ab2297baee4c4f0a540b301db66213d","ec4ddf899007e65fac4754c9506174c156d7e607","2a8426d8e9740fa620667c8ff81459f3e2b73db1","98ccabfe43d25148f805951dc1d419695a743879","df75d7315b2335ac6ba82ea1292525c10af01ad7","4b359ac6ac699d69a1c6a193abd61ccfd2bf38c8","069134a4b5573dd5d7ff7354e48dd68a1d5ace5e","9933b61edb44ebe8dfe8ed7fe13b5637ecbbeecf","bb5aee440d06633e03b2cc553ac55df9c2a2f1aa","452454660ae4c093d77540ff9c76d0f0d3f117b6","750c7605586f579bf575626d5703390fa9532fb9","1790a1a7c51aad2f570c818d237021ad812ea3ce","e438a7292c603bee06f66b21797d0291eae29974","0bd8d623ddcc4578453c16e98ede8a929bc02ea3","d0a11873911e4a45d337b144069be9787b8f5185","1f9b1c49cc1991b2330d6ce3bd8aad3f48bdb9d3","58783edd3d1f61e81d2e8f5291a612a854300988","976136bf36fa5f4f72d5df556a4dab91eba62631","abe7fc7ab4e15010af7c481ac7049f3604090a4d","d912487b418df6319b446ba63c31cd26f91166ff","0b5f95df4563609da73aba80d3941eefc9a4b311","0499189bba7cf6f7062416072077c4870c33d79f","a609e7b19b6e29883b40782fb057fef8463f3d90","e9adcda86517a2377af1870e06675d1d7abb1e23","0d3d5207bbda977cc3e3dec1491524480ae7358f","4413c6864ce0803d25f70760d6a229def7bcf392","0e110fbec28e632a70ca016ad83d44cb902b9ee3","7d4a3bbf69ab9d8473250e88c52d73a93f38370f","e3a1778d1313a48582a209244533b1d9c63dac50","ada37adf755832140727e691ebd792c7461ec5e1","37ff5cf64120dbbcb078b5b99b75c6932b3cb9a2"],"title":"Estimating haplotype frequencies and standard errors for multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.4.513"}

Data on seasonality of births by month of occurrence are modeled with a Box/Jenkins seasonal model with a deterministic seasonality and a stochastic seasonality for Chinese populations in Singapore (1961-86), Malaysia (1966-85), Hong Kong (1971-86), and Taiwan (1964-86). The seasonality of marriages by month of registration was also estimated with least squares regressions. The effect of economic development on seasonality was examined by modeling Chinese birth data for 2 periods: 1961-69 and 1974-86. The Chinese lunar calendar is 12 moons lasting 29-30 days, and a new moon, embolism, is added every 2-3 years to accommodate the Western calendar. In the modeling of births, the deterministic seasonal component is represented by a sin/cos function while the stochastic seasonality is represented as a seasonal autoregressive moving average (ARMA). Methodology is explained. An ARMA model and a subset of ARMA models for the residuals are generated as well as the full model using the maximum likelihood method for all the subsets and choosing a model that minimizes Akaike's information criterion or Schwarz's Bayesian criterion. Data were checked with the Ljung/Box/Pierce Q statistic. The null hypothesis was tested. Data series were adjusted for the length of the month. Unlike double differencing used in ARMA modeling, the subtraction of seasonal means was used because double differencing increased the standard deviations. The results for Malaysia and Hong Kong show deterministic seasonality. A Taiwanese, model, which uses month of registration not occurrence, was more difficult to model, and deterministic seasonality is assumed. The 4 countries were similar: birth peaks in October in Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong and in November in Taiwan. The birth troughs were more variable. Malaysia and Hong Kong models showed a stochastic component as well. Economic development has not changed the seasonality for Singapore. Marriages follow the expected pattern peaking during the Chinese New Year (Jeanuary-February) for Taiwan, and peaks in November and December for Singapore and Hong Kong due to early registration of marriages. Marriage seasonality only explained the seasonality of 1st births. A caveat is that regression models that attempt to eliminate seasonality of births through use of dummy variables may have misleading results.\n","inCitations":["08c8e558e20e0e1b687c76c08a8972ab45d58dbb","1defa8b8278b529de965cef147ac58863b9dc7ad","987bac194211efc8a3eabfd36923f9dd462cec82","1139c49f82fb473c3a3f5ee2bf6b56cf1efa8c40","96b35174f7538026108dbad162dacb9c405e2be2","5aaa01f3a2b461c57c928ff7792a7fa236b3f51e"],"title":"A seasonal analysis of Chinese births.","doi":"10.1080/02664769100000021"}

We develop a marginal model for single‐variant association test statistics of complex diseases that generalizes existing approaches such as LD Score regression and that is applicable to population‐based designs, to family‐based designs or to arbitrary combinations of both. We extend the standard GEE approach so that the parameters of the proposed marginal model can be estimated based on working‐correlation/linkage‐disequilibrium (LD) matrices from external reference panels. Our method achieves substantial efficiency gains over standard approaches, while it is robust against misspecification of the LD structure, i.e. the LD structure of the reference panel can differ substantially from the true LD structure in the study population. In simulation studies and in applications to population‐based and family‐based studies, we illustrate the features of the proposed GEE framework. Our results suggest that our approach can be up to 100% more efficient than existing methodology.","inCitations":["82dca3d0694f080f632e821ce596b38fbdc0df3c","6710c262506d180ebdb238e81a08ee607c06d502","d6d04501fe89b00725daf955dae3049783a1468b"],"title":"PolyGEE: a generalized estimating equation approach to the efficient and robust estimation of polygenic effects in large-scale association studies","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx040"}

In a single framework, we consider four popular asymptotic methods of confidence estimation. These methods are based on model linearization, F-test, likelihood ratio test, and nonparametric bootstrapping procedure. Next, we apply each of these methods to derive three types of confidence sets: confidence intervals, confidence regions, and pointwise confidence bands. Finally, to estimate the actual coverage of these confidence sets, we conduct a simulation study on three regression problems. A linear model and nonlinear Hill and Gompertz models are tested in conditions of different sample size and experimental noise. The simulation study comprises calculation of the actual coverage of confidence sets over pseudo-experimental datasets for each model. For confidence intervals, such metrics as width and simultaneous coverage are also considered. Our comparison shows that the F-test and linearization methods are the most suitable for the construction of confidence intervals, the F-test - for confidence regions and the linearization - for pointwise confidence bands.","inCitations":["c609c1cf33321dd2183e160ee6c51e2e749469ab"],"title":"Comparison of asymptotic confidence sets for regression in small samples.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1052818"}

Unfortunately, this measurement can discard useful data and result in a high false-negative rate. Furthermore, the degree of antitumor activity based on the T/C ratio is assessed on the basis of an arbitrary cutoff point that does not reflect variations in different tumor lines. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an adjusted area-under-the-curve (aAUC) ratio to quantify tumor growth inhibition. A nonparametric bootstrap t-interval of the aAUC ratio is also proposed for assessing the significance of the antitumor activity of the agents. The proposed method is then applied to a real tumor xenograft study.","inCitations":["64d52281fb6a373e2666f8d4d42f0627abc21c90","4bbad961c95a28c1e78a44f190478561ba19d0a0","0967ad8e91f47688c5b6b564255b07b0f50bf4ff","a02f0ca9a84ca5acce647d62c18ef43575300814","a43437a68767d1d23868d292f1a17b9050a36298","62789bf5df92bdf455e48f0ff40b9ea7c63e8938","ea4602605658b549dfe76c75aea4f974fc76672a","e933ad0ccb79b277dc3d9dc1d41743bff6e5e4cd"],"title":"Interval approach to assessing antitumor activity for tumor xenograft studies.","doi":"10.1002/pst.369"}

Usually the primary objective of such a study is to identify experimental therapies that are efficacious compared to a historical control. Each arm is independently evaluated using a standard design a for single-arm Phase II trial, e.g., Simon's optimal or minimax design. When more than one arm is accepted through such a randomized trial, we may want to select the winner(s) among them. There are methods for between-arm comparisons in the literature, but most of them have drawbacks. They have a large false selection (type I error) probability when the competing arms have a small difference in efficacy, or the statistical tests used in the selection procedure do not properly reflect the small sample sizes and multi-stage design of the trials. In this paper, we propose between-arm comparison methods for selection in randomized Phase II trials addressing these issues.","inCitations":["66c15bded6ddfde6e1fa3ff5187904caea8a5967","dbde465d66054e23243169a4c0bfaaa4ffdb4871","1d938fbf7ed59ba63717f85b3a1036a77037fea0","40f19fda5e166eefe2316188559e23366faf79b8"],"title":"Between-arm comparisons in randomized Phase II trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400902802391"}

One goal of analysis is to describe the effect of tamoxifen on the probabilities of recurrence or death from other causes. To this end, we propose a semi-parametric transformation model for the crude failure probabilities of a competing risk, conditional on covariates. The model is developed as an extension of the standard approach to survival data with independent right censoring. Estimation of the regression coefficients is achieved with a rank-based least squares criterion. Simulations show that the procedure works well with practical sample sizes. A separate estimating function is developed for the baseline parameter. Prediction of covariate-adjusted failure probabilities is considered. The methodology is motivated and illustrated with data from the tamoxifen trial.","inCitations":["89f5997112a2e0778ba8016593973c6622252674","1e1cd779738c4a3ccdd8fd54cb05512f4d99e608","cc62c63c3b0ab23a17f4ddddd8c867a50cfda07e","d916c5fe02891f80b18ea0af4a063ffdf7e12e8e","136cd133159d686c27a08df306cfe4fd37ffcfc0","78b349f1d3ff0046643c9f81874ecdd281884181","341ca1161457ca4a5854c2725a731a4ed825ce8e","6e04e147821a82bef7d7f3a8e4535e7f68289d53","8e7b06885912e91b2506e40c6aa58605cd841650","e585aaaf86ce7a66b9bd28ada6196096be3aaffb","4f4751d39ab509a6774c91373c5c06e88a547cc4","cbd3d7c4c62cf61f729a0d21a61d686abbab37ef","cd11548a8359dd037b0f69a6896cdba6103b4701","d0affb26938f90b7d1dd2af145ed7cc5fb910d95","26569e2c4240adbb52114f534ab4b29e273a10b9","3b3310f2617f2a9f2888671b061d9f4d298e2c84","bd0484b5efd83aee720fadb826b3467a46bcd090","442ee982ded22cefef79adc7026ba4477854883a","73822a45e1ca97cacd1caeb1a86e7716f8784eaf","46a6fdffb68bcdad49377601ce3ed30abdd28847","ef36a87f0eadeddd70baa8d9837f7633c83df0ec","cb0d71e8a5744b5fce4ca98a1fe7cdcf50e32f3d","ea2e0a17cdcac0a23db4bbc8a80fcc6aa66e92df","7905a24a6714fca40a8cc887caf6c6b91b9d4758","caeba827b04077d49ca76c75824e891708e24a88","4e6ebaf69d7c54e790bc90e69b5f14281b8d47e2","a6160ddac887f3b2f1b33b7910dacec5b86a38ec","e69d82d2614c405dd71133a1b5405d9874522c01","ab6f0b366c9180ac6eafc3a137b1886acd314a92","dc2863de7c490f8ebe0308c0aeac069c88e1120e","f7fc221652bf2abd9db094c610e4b90c7df01ca9","6feacb42dc9319d719f15212ac7f68bdad18d651","b1c6f29ffab9d921f6f1e907c47d27335b0efa52","6ff187ef847f9e522a777f93a7773a82ec4d0e89","7432c8dc239cd9a4c36017e99e15f2ced89dbb85","bc213ed85c2384cdf38c1b04e365985bd26e2fbb","a82743815d6f76e4dd4f0feb78667a86f3604cb4","f7377af5e33e4f5b21eb6aa4752738196f00ac0e","593baa5ed11df71b27d8f6d85d59c589468befd2","5fab0f516e603021f86551692a2f28e28ca1d4a6","5c911495d88ca963dcbfbef68012352056a4c826","ab3d8a808b72ffed9833ed210aff5674cb181d3d","0e84ce6d128e9ec55782b4e5b845207b112cc517","02d8ee3b906841eb279a273fdb43ca16402fd6fc","61361b41036a95bd6ecbc0d5ebe9a8d6bfed06cf","3752c061cb970615bc6fa81b3a892cd77a94415d","6b2b1394341c37b8b7624d8918ce77095358cd6f","90b38bdb1ba5fb174f5abfe67fc666922082d1ed","9b96d97edcbae7972bd8bc0eee3581d95ed9fc71","847bb8c0cd0644f8ca031b634f88013a110c78fa","61c61519d9580aae9f700d56177cbd5228e9df8d","c9093b7026e815d60c6d378c0725d923d7f71ea5","528b8cc3f63c8c9151ba0c35fa4cd0538fe2fc13","5fcdfb656bd94d264b33248aff29993b3d6256db","7b31881bbe6b168c1a9853bc3ed76c61a61a8f6d","29d1169c778055a6a4c151a529e48c45ef52601f","3e0c8eedb8ad1ee88151b01721f245f8be1e6078","6106c8187b2731c9ca3113d618e9c9ef5500b6d0","3b1521ab1c65e61d65538793f37f509e28bae0b0","07e6b08afc8e11394333863098177c82555a46e3","2a17702f811c8cebca10cb36d51d903a6565b10d","819663344dcba37ce0d6e0ff317b7673fc0c5ff9","beb9aa140d71c3f653029e60a49fbcbda2619d95","c4c6391d6329159dd413d38f4edd68c73c4d8459","8b41c0a234ef76263e858a8ec1ad42fe2cda5488","9224f5b2a83dbe9fa0ddf03a81cb23418eb445ab","cd508c12e1bfb2e7ebb19f7bdffe11ddb98a37cc","779f37b5c82fd4913aae29d19d7e0cd0d2bc00e4","1ab456e6fe54da533bcf2311fd6768870212a954","3f314db0464ce766312a80c35681a259db63ed2c","bf85fd8a0304796e1da6e415ad7d31a6a274664b","cd4388c93a6f7bec2040d268fbbd60b0313341c9","a3b526387591e7a1504ed48ff5c158401f434e6b","c29f8e6f2f4e51ea171f7bfd1fc99d9c74400982","c7198b2566819678d6c35fbf1bd9d887e246a5e8","f376ed7786ab8138ae280c4a1ac8e7653dbe714a","4e273483d5bc9f25a8503149b47e20f45f580d33","621bb22448806021c77f9f697f7ae5dad38e728f","f5a118a27d566a3a465260cc4f65cd375f6f60a2","696711a5534656e75c347ef095df9ed2f6d81ceb","425e4b31f4d541242b60cd33093247bf4d9136fc","caea6b6797d37e3d8b41fe3ec2dc137b510189f8"],"title":"Regression modeling of competing crude failure probabilities.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/2.1.85"}

A continuous threshold expectile regression is developed for modeling data in which the effect of a covariate on the response variable is linear but varies below and above an unknown threshold in a continuous way. The estimators for the threshold and the regression coefficients are obtained using a grid search approach. The asymptotic properties for all the estimators are derived, and the estimator for the threshold is shown to achieve root-n consistency. A weighted CUSUM type test statistic is proposed for the existence of a threshold at a given expectile, and its asymptotic properties are derived under both the null and the local alternative models. This test only requires fitting the model under the null hypothesis in the absence of a threshold, thus it is computationally more efficient than the likelihood-ratio type tests. Simulation studies show that the proposed estimators and test have desirable finite sample performance in both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic cases. The application of the proposed method on a Dutch growth data and a baseball pitcher salary data reveals interesting insights. The proposed method is implemented in the R package cthreshER.","inCitations":["983e22e9cac7b30f173a9fbefa7bb74ce0a808b9","80fb2bddaff2e7e2bc66610361d9eead59c8561a"],"title":"A continuous threshold expectile model","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2017.07.005"}

The usual asymptotic chi-square distribution of the likelihood ratio and score statistics under this null hypothesis is incorrect because the null is on the boundary of the parameter space. During the last two decades many tests have been proposed to overcome this difficulty, but these tests cannot be easily applied for testing multiple variance components, especially for testing a subset of them. We instead introduce a simple test statistic based on the variance least square estimator of variance components. With this comes a permutation procedure to approximate its finite sample distribution. The proposed test covers testing multiple variance components and any subset of them in LME models. Interestingly, our method does not depend on the distribution of the random effects and errors except for their mean and variance.

While there are several recent studies investigating equivalence tests for comparing means, little research has been conducted on equivalence methods for evaluating the equivalence or similarity of two correlation coefficients or two regression coefficients. The current project proposes novel tests for evaluating the equivalence of two regression or correlation coefficients derived from the two one-sided tests (TOST) method (Schuirmann, 1987, J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm, 15, 657) and an equivalence test by Anderson and Hauck (1983, Stat. Commun., 12, 2663). A simulation study was used to evaluate the performance of these tests and compare them with the common, yet inappropriate, method of assessing equivalence using non-rejection of the null hypothesis in difference-based tests. Results demonstrate that equivalence tests have more accurate probabilities of declaring equivalence than difference-based tests. However, equivalence tests require large sample sizes to ensure adequate power. We recommend the Anderson-Hauck equivalence test over the TOST method for comparing correlation or regression coefficients.","inCitations":["b0cbfa4ab8a867ee84b7e03753b04bbdc1d4694a","020fa764e4d5b89166471aafd927b0361bbb13b4","1fa1ebdcd2455ea5781e052475f6aac1d94a27ec","d4782d4c0bc0d4da7ee1bf643b62985238fa05df","f495c0c22b9b87797bec0fe20ea156c1748949c6","ed4b3f60ab4b0274b614127aa92215c0ab1ba9c9","f4a77bdab3dfb674ddb1d4036b9dab3238f32b2d","d31e918b6d2f227472e90aab903bd58362d48b34","aba90e8c177bbb67fc91b5435f0fd658433f2977","285527e74ca680157c584f40a82e3b56c957e353","c626474abb6977e62d9829c7c8bc9304757ec162"],"title":"Equivalence tests for comparing correlation and regression coefficients.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12045"}

More widespread adoption of thresh-old regression faces two challenges: (i) the computational complexity of fitting threshold regression models and (ii) obtaining correct coverage of confidence intervals under model misspecification. Both challenges result from the non-smooth and non-convex nature of the threshold regression model likelihood function. In this paper we first show that these two issues together make the ideal approach for making model-robust inference in continuous threshold linear regression an impractical one. The need for a faster way of fitting continuous threshold linear models motivated us to develop a fast grid search method. The new method, based on the simple yet powerful dynamic programming principle, improves the performance by several orders of magnitude.","inCitations":["bfbae22ffc50a22decb49cf1041d92b0777b30ce"],"title":"Fast Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for Continuous Threshold Linear Regression.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2018.1537927"}

Sample size calculation is an important part of clinical trial design and it is often based on the method of analysis. We present a method for calculating the sample size for repeated binary pharmacodynamic measurements based on analysis by mixed-effects modelling and using a logit transformation. Wald test is used for hypothesis testing. The method can be used to calculate the sample size required for detecting parameter differences between subpopulations. Extensions to account for unequal allocation of subjects across groups and unbalanced sampling designs between and within groups were also derived. The proposed method has been assessed via simulation of a linear model and estimation using NONMEM. The results showed good agreement between nominal power and power estimated from the NONMEM simulations. The results also showed that sample size increases with increased variability at a rate that depends on the difference in parameter estimates between groups, and designs that involve sampling based on an optimal design can help to reduce cost.","inCitations":["83338c0a1e3906d27d22cd419420e8a90c00c91c","1abf816a5908b6ccc9490e69a922cc7faf915b51","b969ce8edb9a75b5d92353fc24be9da230f03af2"],"title":"Sample size calculations for population pharmacodynamic experiments involving repeated dichotomous observations.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802375845"}

When combined with a parametric baseline hazard, this yields a model with heterogeneity on both the individual and the family level and a subgroup with zero frailty, corresponding to people not experiencing the event. In this paper, we discuss covariates in the model. Depending on where the covariates are inserted in the model, one may have proportional hazards at the individual level, the family level, and a larger group level (for covariates shared by many families, e.g. ethnic groups) or get accelerated failure times. Each of these alternatives gives a specific interpretation of the covariate effects. An application to data infant mortality in siblings from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway is included.
