For example, enrollment of a subpopulation where there is sufficient evidence of treatment efficacy, futility, or harm could be stopped, while enrollment for the remaining subpopulations is continued. We propose a new class of multiple testing procedures tailored to adaptive enrichment designs. The procedures synthesize ideas from two general approaches. As in the modified group sequential approach, the procedures gain power by leveraging the covariance among statistics for different stages and different hypotheses. As in the alpha reallocation approach, the procedures lower rejection thresholds for the remaining null hypotheses after others have been rejected. The proposed procedures are proved to have power greater than or equal to several existing methods, and to strongly control the familywise Type I error rate when statistics are normally distributed. The methods are illustrated through simulations of a trial for a surgical intervention for stroke, involving two subpopulations.","inCitations":["c8c6bb4e0bd06c2a0341a199312bf2358fb4257b","a6682010cf47cb1b7ced56cd7213881abd48d18b","d1633d91c23134fcfaf07bb537e63d374e1e2382","f89cee70bc6b230cacb0d94e7da9ae4bede95383","9c50a9ba3965142a71d4d8ded61de636a7669128","99c13f7782353abfaf867c240397aec0318655c0"],"title":"Multiple testing procedures for adaptive enrichment designs: combining group sequential and reallocation approaches.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw014"}

When all of the observed variability in the effect sizes can be accounted for based on sampling error alone, a set of effect sizes is said to be homogeneous and a fixed-effects model is typically adopted. Whether a set of effect sizes is homogeneous or not is usually tested with the so-called Q test. In this paper, a variety of alternative homogeneity tests - the likelihood ratio, Wald and score tests - are compared with the Q test in terms of their Type I error rate and power for four different effect size measures. Monte Carlo simulations show that the Q test kept the tightest control of the Type I error rate, although the results emphasize the importance of large sample sizes within the set of studies. The results also suggest under what conditions the power of the tests can be considered adequate.","inCitations":["fe7e821cd24ee93969f53415ef1cdea8a6bd4fce","9e5f1fe4ac2d61b13cf346f2d2377ea45787eaa6","a4d6ffeb164172941fb9107584f048abb0d39f1d","7b1fc9e999f098a26ee5216e9a7928f277f0f3e1","1cb8fa8348a41b6dfe1f58c2c347256cfaf43374","cf662b0db77f65b9085e3d5058a69ca58fe35d0c","67feef8d1de1552a04b6143e787413ecbab010d8","f9ab69e0466aeda3496856869a72413fcbe18c43","70f65725db2f58bfd411df6e1c0bd9a2f0e8e9b1","41dc8b090f592d35ace866bd24cf7c1ef9c353fa","660607f2b258cf7a50a6918654385f4688f2316d","2f05f3598b701d1d02db0746b2068986a82084fb","1e5a94848a6b68b85e7bfa6792e1d305769a36ca","18956cdbd9b2cde8c97c3a06937f277cabc7ce09","fdc1a7c83026375b9476b48cd3726dbf588ede22","287d692f6997cf7f8753e0ddc44b70e7e158b9e3","95c153b0e40f291f5ce53e513856bb713c58863e","793704ba0a02427ef85ff022c6efe44675eb376e","89f5eadd9f69bd7aa4e9bdf942fc372da3c15e81","3bd5694663db7c6a7c5005a1b03b34e72c9dec63","8a9b48cfcb699e7f630837e2a9df5a0635d59865","c69743186d4fd66df5377b3830b955156a398b6d","c859fcc11bc689ee1fdb40b03bdf57c41d3bbf77","5f5774346c02149aabfc39f4f50ddd3365ba2630","bb47df597aefd0747d6a1eb3a4c1600481938136","d2a19d1e185a6c8354f20abc68cee5f512c55117","a1a5e781c8f4f95dcdb65fb144c6196410a61965","39b05b44bb7dd9b882b9d9947a9bba4512fcdd43","c540ef1f20b1484657f509a5801124afd21adbd3","06653591bc5292e3d693e27efcd8a0a37f732422","a98affe2e9a60bd2d7613766c1ff14f47c9f8f51","4c4ef9dc08520f00fb4cf5b6ac7459b5fc802604","c60a6aa8acdd2b275a5b3ad7e73120fae0404ea2","49b1162a7c46958db6d41be81f31ea3a1952c424","8df4e5f0daf0c3e643fc228f680ded3cb35ddb9c","54c155f7e911ab8e6cc987dda104418a3a6ecfcc","660ead10a1131ca4b477a544142d92aae3f5e810","841adb9b2ab355f044abb5fe2e12d1d3e687ff1b","8ccf3d882688d58a1d943f56df0190932d0bee12","855e0036ad4df3559646a56c068eaf709be59fb3","c80c9370a0e0081ec1f6e2285166fac448d72c29","fe57e059e1d2e8f7856c041e608c66283e69979b","43e165a305155b9da023f3093d8db64a2d8063bb","7b30be2ca09899be990e3b6bc43943beb00119eb","2df1f1a2217c667e530a326e5953eeaee1aa90f2","92ced4078f0dae7e44f08084cb6ca18768711dcc","f04ff55ed4a9762205f3bfb4283a03b1e7c3f158"],"title":"Hypothesis tests for population heterogeneity in meta-analysis.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X64042"}

In general, the test statistics in a sequential trial can be properly approximated by a Brownian motion with a drift parameter at interim looks. The unadjusted maximum likelihood estimator can be potentially very biased due to the possible early stopping rule at any interim. In this paper, we investigate the conditional and marginal biases with focus on the conditional one upon the stopping time in estimating the Brownian motion drift parameter. It is found that the conditional bias may be very serious for existing point estimation methods, even if the unconditional bias is satisfactory. New conditional estimators are thus proposed, which can significantly reduce the conditional bias from unconditional estimators. The results of Monte-Carlo studies show that the proposed estimators can provide a much smaller conditional bias and MSE than the naive MLE and a Whitebead's bias reduced estimator.","inCitations":["c3b0c03bffcd6c83f283b372a01e0bdf0717d230","0ddad7494d1950c86c126949f67917ffb5ee288c","535e80966171161a5bde8acd3c39c250689d70a5","50857af657dcf6cfc54150afa7b40a3bec06aa85","ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb","a491668346dbe1c6d6f0e29abf1fbd1c819606f0","021a95f88f414e29222507792e192e6ab0d0b8eb","9290e054b4a6021aac8f753af798d42a1e1493d8","d0a946c35e14cc01319a0d25da9469ac5615a792","ad2ca11910bdb77d08ee80423b3438c038bc5b5d","863c0e499d88d323ae4727944687cb1a10ec28fa","f4fe120da04072fe855a9451b2278f4b20b44c89","51c240589f3ef162adab04295a5d64e48a51fc9a","f2e0f90209c0ecedf8877570e9a181df35e9a3cf","168c3ad0b4780e1ed25458f4de930d588d930fc5","8208966b3efcac46f42b0ce0ee43a1c0d9502c66"],"title":"Conditional bias of point estimates following a group sequential test.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120037195"}

The condition holds with probability 1, if the predictors are drawn from a continuous distribution. We discuss the necessity of this condition for uniqueness and also provide a closely related condition which ensures uniqueness of lasso estimators (Tibshirani, 1996). Large sample asymptotics for the Dantzig selector, i.e. almost sure convergence and the asymptotic distribution, follow directly from our uniqueness results and a continuity argument. The limiting distribution of the Dantzig selector is generally non-normal. Though our asymptotic results require that the number of predictors is fixed (similar to (Knight and Fu, 2000)), our uniqueness results are valid for an arbitrary number of predictors and observations.","inCitations":["0fbfcb4f496710833f5cd145e7baf935ef50bc57"],"title":"Parallelism, uniqueness, and large-sample asymptotics for the Dantzig selector.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.11151"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2011,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"Moderated multiple regression (MMR) is frequently employed to analyse interaction effects between continuous predictor variables. The procedure of mean centring is commonly recommended to mitigate the potential threat of multicollinearity between predictor variables and the constructed cross-product term. Also, centring does typically provide more straightforward interpretation of the lower-order terms. This paper attempts to clarify two methodological issues of potential confusion. First, the positive and negative effects of mean centring on multicollinearity diagnostics are explored. It is illustrated that the mean centring method is, depending on the characteristics of the data, capable of either increasing or decreasing various measures of multicollinearity. Second, the exact reason why mean centring does not affect the detection of interaction effects is given. The explication shows the symmetrical influence of mean centring on the corrected sum of squares and variance inflation factor of the product variable while maintaining the equivalence between the two residual sums of squares for the regression of the product term on the two predictor variables. Thus the resulting test statistic remains unchanged regardless of the obvious modification of multicollinearity with mean centring. These findings provide a clear understanding and demonstration on the diverse impact of mean centring in MMR applications.","inCitations":["46ffb69db7f47c21bec470c151c9231476d44fbf","ce6b781f1efe0fb688f212ffffc16be7e32be2cc","160ad42dde9b8264234aa8350dca14bfdf578feb","19d8cac1f8589763e99207f9df2e69ed4cbc0a89","2ad5fec893b29f14c6da0b270d15c3e1f010a3d7","2f8fc40e6a6a9f3adbb6af19f54344d0bff1b793","6b157cc19831b1ee7e477ae98774dad4abf778a6","f065e973aeea06b999290296876048d592032139","7f988e455582f48a8b7baa420b7c80da389a497d","7ab2bac37535ed129780359ec0c4fadc8152db0d","01a0195e0ecb6c8aedabda05291224acf8895c0a","3dd6e40a1fa52337c02582a91f5707268175d22b","884c60873e0b1336b8de81fabba8c2d2a2dc4330","dd620bfcc332c955ed7d7ca19ab55a200c986fc7","8b2b73bc135099b71dffd59fe9d76de1cd2fc499","7ef7d2007048780da92e6e68c4239713a256a14f","5fb2f3d3b54605e31d670b35851fcde3283c73ad","b4e0551affb27c22fb55ce929514f2bfb23a8bff","4a950066b6a1d9eb9bfa9de51a935e68684646c5","c9055cecb74abce1c19fbbd7b69dd6c13ae0c9e4","8dc79656ed100f6af22620b366eb064f8b5c20a9","54f3f65f27b208f9c71b4cb94c5b23a444dcdd58","657957c366de691ea41689d32778b7aa50824db4","239a4868feb712b95251558d40ce2c84be41b01c","d85cb14407b83a87bfe79303e37a2118ec7a1ef5","b677830e5d62d3f78b20cabeedb0210fe274178d","15c9454fb2fa4f5ba2321613454a4aa69209f637","75d4251ae0e663696ef4e65c81db2436b8035c7a","e1089ebbcf25c2eaeb2c35887fa81a62d40b248a","32551490caf1046885c38e47f8717e0097250d28","862dd61cccad6b39ffe890557db19a6356bbe8ca","ac220751319a7def58411d4dca44e1f440c85b22","34b6caacae1ceaa8cfbd3c741ee095857e2febf9","e5d7f8c040e2b8c7664a74824a1d477ce910fa17","42f26633b476dcdaad6996c6a2e58f5f129473ae","af8b2fe94c603a716104ccbc442a1c33c213ef03","fad3fc413e7cc2d8734bc721c18c3aff55a7ba25","f236598ee2b1b659ded825680327258af025d894","bcdcca44e7d8a99fda51d289faa15d1b1173e9e6","9e2c39d6fae085956c5e51cee8fa8a3ad7b7b468","ba98011b0f1366db52195c2e4b86eceecf398e42","80fd8ec50f7c4e524b95eedc55c9098967b1a4d1"],"title":"Clarifying the role of mean centring in multicollinearity of interaction effects.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2010.02002.x"}

I provide an equivalent aggregate-data EM algorithm and supporting software with the R package ipdmeta for the estimation of the \"interaction meta-analysis\" when the variance components are unknown. The properties of the methodology are assessed with simulation studies. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated with analyses of the effect modification of cholesterol and age on pravastatin in the multicenter placebo-controlled regression growth evaluation statin study.

More particularly, model selection via the information criteria, such as the BIC with modifications, have received considerable attention in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. However, such modifications often depend upon several factors, such as sample size, prior distribution, and the type of experiment, e.g., backcross, intercross. These changes make it difficult to generalize the methods to all cases. The fence method avoids such limitations with a unified approach, and hence can be used more broadly. In this paper, this method is studied in the case of backcross experiments throughout a series of simulation studies. The results are compared with those of the modified BIC method as well as some of the most popular shrinkage methods for model selection.","inCitations":["21893f6093e106c600353fcc47d4edf15ed7cec7","c0d7d059688a97c75be1d6f3c2647135c88268ca"],"title":"Fence Methods for Backcross Experiments.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2012.721885"}

This class and a very useful subclass of graphical procedures are described, and it is then shown how the direct approach of Guilbaud (2008) for such CTPs can be extended to cover also CTPs that are not Bonferroni based and that may utilize dependencies not utilized by Bonferroni-based procedures. The simultaneous confidence regions that can be derived through this extension include the known confidence bounds for the step-down version of one-sided Dunnett-type multiple comparisons versus a control in the balanced case. As a simple illustration of how the general results can be applied, similar bounds are derived for the unbalanced case. As a further, more elaborated, illustration, confidence bounds are derived for the Dunnett gatekeeping procedure of Xu et al. (2009) based on a primary and a secondary variable. In this procedure, primary rejections are made through an ordinary one-sided Dunnett procedure, and secondary rejections are restricted to treatment comparisons with primary rejections. It turns out that ordinary Dunnett-type confidence assertions can be made for all primary comparisons without rejections. Interestingly, informative confidence assertions can be made also for secondary comparisons without rejections, but only in case of matching primary rejections. The gatekeeping is thus naturally extended to confidence assertions.","inCitations":["c59eb647e06e261eb691cac76ff5611f672b6d74","bb14db2049fa93c922d54fbe39ac9854dae51707","451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54","59751bbab1ae7660a65c065222830952cb17ee2f","86329018e2d19074629a9546365bc81a1dd474fe","3cea33630055a671c9134c45eda7ff4901eb788c","ce57dfefad9c5b4af71253982f213292dbbf9381","ac1fbb3e6e21f28033c732c72ff07c3416d84366","b93f9ef4cf683853eb2b03fc7ca1fe3d82b4e80e"],"title":"Confidence regions for Bonferroni-based closed tests extended to more general closed tests.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.551331"}

Several extensions of this rule have been proposed, and their properties were analyzed from an asymptotic viewpoint and compared via simulations in a finite setup. The aim of this paper is to push forward these comparisons by taking also into account the adjustable BCD, which is never considered up to now. Firstly, we show that the adjustable BCD performs better than Efron's coin with respect to both loss of precision and randomness. Moreover, the adjustable BCD is always more balanced than the other coins and, only for some sample sizes, slightly more predictable. Therefore, we suggest the dominant BCD, namely a new and flexible class of procedures that can change the allocation rule step by step in order to ensure very good performance in terms of both balance and selection bias for any sample size. Our simulations demonstrate that the dominant BCD is more balanced and, at the same time, less or equally predictable than Atkinson's optimum BCD.","inCitations":["1039200746ea47501a13be7e7a146e1ebd6cf302","3c649b6c0e737985f2c0927787cc587f2d9867e9","c0fc0b028ba583d6ed47233f3c4f5ebfb50ab0c1","726b4c66fe28cf7f59e2d804a0c165ef7e682fe5","31a82d9447f12ece3f21685fe8bf089ad1c54d68"],"title":"Balance and randomness in sequential clinical trials: the dominant biased coin design.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1607"}

Though different methods have been proposed for heterogeneity adjustment, no systematic theory exists to justify these methods. In this work, we propose a generic framework named ALPHA (short for Adaptive Low-rank Principal Heterogeneity Adjustment) to model, estimate, and adjust heterogeneity from the original data. Once the heterogeneity is adjusted, we are able to remove the batch effects and to enhance the inferential power by aggregating the homogeneous residuals from multiple sources. Under a pervasive assumption that the latent heterogeneity factors simultaneously affect a fraction of observed variables, we provide a rigorous theory to justify the proposed framework. Our framework also allows the incorporation of informative covariates and appeals to the 'Bless of Dimensionality'. As an illustrative application of this generic framework, we consider a problem of estimating high-dimensional precision matrix for graphical model inference based on multiple datasets. We also provide thorough numerical studies on both synthetic datasets and a brain imaging dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed theory and methods.","inCitations":["629201384405a694d42f438d38b25cb886509f03","4c93ea4e4e605786d590acf5639662a14a2060fa","9138182644dd05a9d84d772cb29c463ac9a9e9a3","516600be5e1ffea32ab1c21f0553d8d01295d69b"],"title":"Heterogeneity adjustment with applications to graphical model inference.","doi":"10.1214/18-EJS1466"}

Based on simulation studies, we provide guidelines for best practice.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Many clinical trials are designed with a fixed sample size or total number of events to detect a postulated size of treatment effect on a primary efficacy endpoint. When the trial is completed and the primary efficacy endpoint achieves statistical significance, formal statistical testing of other clinically important secondary endpoints often follows in order for the statistically and clinically significant results of these endpoints to be included in the label of the test pharmaceutical product. In conventional fixed designs without any interim analysis or trial extension, these endpoints are often tested in a pre-specified hierarchical order, following the closed testing principle. This testing strategy ensures a strong control of the overall type I error. However, when trials are conducted using a group-sequential design with interim analyses or can be extended using an adaptive design with an increase of sample size or total number of events, this conventional hierarchical testing strategy may violate the closure principle and the overall type I error rate may not be controlled in the strong sense.","inCitations":["7aaa0c07faae8274a8335452f9e7d67ec6706dae","fb86c7364132da5dea8c52b53b353be59cb5a641","fc88591df0f84fe2892adc945bf296dea5ffcb7b","ed4ee8c782f006e8063fd0988d0bc9f4a216a14f","f2d0c63426714f32fa6432403d2bb9900aaace5b","da31c253ec39a2de6b49d25b28cf745167debbf7","307afb62a018a9291e16ccc94572258f95c49b56","31d5bda9e9e2494a7ba5c0ef17101dfde9e56832","94d2249ff69d32560d5fccadcbaad778e12dfa16","c93d397707e6386e297a3a130168085b9d0fa2aa","6955d247738455a1d0aec3690695f006bf1ec8b4","f31cd19acb93ff9e54129182e071861d67257944","050a4112bc918c683b6a0cdaad8f1fdc50199522","5668ed77d1955d78e1db80eca063359953cdda64","507f6e8bc1697edfe343c586bc2910388d22a573","41e38d48ecb98e36c23057a537e4c3dfb9c936e0","23f64bc4f6485bb113e69fe8331ed5f01ccde21f","b105adec12f579765f7641ebabc177cd3a1a2b82","920f3ea3416cac09ff6b70d01bac940a293d2846","70f9f1f7ccd246d5df37adba50f726faf73981d5","7208a0c4ab5e65c1ffa168dca813fdba28378968"],"title":"Statistical considerations for testing multiple endpoints in group sequential or adaptive clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701645405"}

Buckley and James [Linear regression with censored data, Biometrika 66 (1979) 429-436] extended the least squares estimator to the semiparametric censored linear regression model in which the error distribution is completely unspecified. The Buckley-James estimator performs well in many simulation studies and examples. The direct interpretation of the AFT model is also more attractive than the Cox model, as Cox has pointed out, in practical situations. However, the application of the Buckley-James estimation was limited in practice mainly due to its illusive variance. In this paper, we use the empirical likelihood method to derive a new test and confidence interval based on the Buckley-James estimator of the regression coefficient. A standard chi-square distribution is used to calculate the P-value and the confidence interval. The proposed empirical likelihood method does not involve variance estimation. It also shows much better small sample performance than some existing methods in our simulation studies.","inCitations":["b7a554341f4d41ae23256ff6af1c98cd4560486f","48cd5456758c14a57f5aed9c2b6b537498f08393","a3e29db27278810479e2c6b32681b1350986e301","f1c90f4e25eeaf7ab7f84915a74e4c9cb23650ea","8c1a6c2b35aed3be106b5d3986f5099b7c99a38d","c5670c42b5f01b4990c780d4425326dd4fac11ff","09720572a04ed39f3e4166a2b3b55e01d6559536","45ffc7b84af8d7c36383da44891693149c768b4c","10dd134bb246cfaf4e4ba88451c50d55c2cecaa5","9e08c295680be9380a552cac270a4ecb9e76bd1e","d75ab5addd32b209c38194b630f22d9a48d592eb","b6b24c37527eee090c1c8ca9a4d009ea25fd94f4","c061b9782a9e02c9c02f17aa64cd0f8c091612e6","f16b8d6dca9aefeb15b1ebfd83fa116f0288487c","b50d86f3771a5663e436dbc9b67ef900d3d4b43b","3aef6b72e77ccbeec01d8d0ffb1168060403cc65","39793c0c97d323e48e54409df3adf8ba1c72ae3c","5c7c1169a6d59173c8f4c0109fae18198b0217a9","8e92502ae0fa3930bfb618f8a15e1b9740257c35","0a69437472c17ee98a1b525cc18179de8205bb94","994fbcd127396a7572feb518e4d887faad04c000","7305f44353d05f55e84e5a17120b8f3ce4c4ce37","d8c4903daf9a5e3a2957053e7308c29550b3fa9e"],"title":"Empirical likelihood analysis of the Buckley-James estimator.","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2007.02.007"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2010,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Computational statistics & data analysis","paperAbstract":"Multivariate extensions of well-known linear mixed-effects models have been increasingly utilized in inference by multiple imputation in the analysis of multilevel incomplete data. The normality assumption for the underlying error terms and random effects plays a crucial role in simulating the posterior predictive distribution from which the multiple imputations are drawn. The plausibility of this normality assumption on the subject-specific random effects is assessed. Specifically, the performance of multiple imputation created under a multivariate linear mixed-effects model is investigated on a diverse set of incomplete data sets simulated under varying distributional characteristics. Under moderate amounts of missing data, the simulation study confirms that the underlying model leads to a well-calibrated procedure with negligible biases and actual coverage rates close to nominal rates in estimates of the regression coefficients. Estimation quality of the random-effect variance and association measures, however, are negatively affected from both the misspecification of the random-effect distribution and number of incompletely-observed variables. Some of the adverse impacts include lower coverage rates and increased biases.","inCitations":["e1e885ff11a84d84b878b9a5bf6208a50425bd02","b8172859083948d928194ebdd929e600edbc3604","db636373cf6a4d97455d629283f6b57539546e68","42712ea1635cb0c76a601322c56423e1aa17579c","7cba74bd9fdd1faa0379806bcd457fa21f4c2ccf","ca4c513d9cfeaaff06bc744cf29f6c6d89cbdb44","9f43ba332fd9893007595d0f5b827be0be13681a","73a908acbb9391db71f4604fddbe5562f48f7ede","4f421c4a979a35388104718797eef76741aa2b3d","a317f361703f6a3b31246e849be1417cd1172614","5c057bce85b4ba0f63f6282a733f4fb2e631c1de","f5ee91032af869d1e63e8a2736679bd7b8bc014d","dc76a6ef0777b1bb199f2b554db0ea499d8131a1"],"title":"Impact of non-normal random effects on inference by multiple imputation: A simulation assessment","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2009.01.016"}

The approach is often adopted to develop influence analysis procedures for factor analysis models with ranking data. However, as this well-known approach is based on the observed data likelihood, which involves multidimensional integrals, directly applying it to develop influence analysis procedures for the factor analysis models with ranking data is difficult. To address this difficulty, a Monte Carlo expectation and maximization algorithm (MCEM) is used to obtain the maximum-likelihood estimate of the model parameters, and measures for influence analysis on the basis of the conditional expectation of the complete data log likelihood at the E-step of the MCEM algorithm are then obtained. Very little additional computation is needed to compute the influence measures, because it is possible to make use of the by-products of the estimation procedure. Influence measures that are based on several typical perturbation schemes are discussed in detail, and the proposed method is illustrated with two real examples and an artificial example.","inCitations":["fde076bcaf9fb94cce1dedb388a73ac6b617bc6e"],"title":"Influence analysis for the factor analysis model with ranking data.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X169991"}

For a continuous-scale diagnostic test, the optimal cut point for positive disease is the cut point leading to the maximization of the sum of sensitivity and specificity. Finding the Youden index of the test is equivalent to maximize the sum of sensitivity and specificity for all the possible values of the cut point. In this paper, we propose new nonparametric confidence intervals for the Youden index. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to compare the relative performance of the new intervals with the existing parametric interval for the index. Our simulation results indicate that the newly developed nonparametric intervals are competitive with the existing parametric interval when the underlying distributions are correctly specified, and they outperform the existing parametric interval when the underlying distributions are misspecified. The new intervals are robust and easy to implement in practice. A real example is also used to illustrate the application of the proposed intervals.","inCitations":["24a2539fd9875a2b9ddc0a2ced5fc3a955b91606","c3fca18f30d0d800a2bee6111400b88e6ecca05b","6d6fa364cdb69e1ee9566b01195d715c3b32b190","24d5dd418308549c93b527ef9519e7fb70f2a714","576b5344277b6a22eaa3f9302c896e4e6dfa46ba","f8657e5f9c98d36c0672dd2006a9a161e22071f8","4243cded47b7b0d4a39f02940420d91b60ce187e","d2cffa5d9b5768784212b145a49de0db0ab8e8b8","9f7f5e727faea4b22556ba5dd0983b23a1fd8d01"],"title":"New nonparametric confidence intervals for the Youden index.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.592234"}

In practice, however, disease status may vary over time and there is often a time lag between when the marker is measured and the occurrence of disease. One example concerns the Framingham risk score (FR-score) as a marker for the future risk of cardiovascular events, events that occur after the score is ascertained. To evaluate such a marker, one needs to take the time lag into account since the predictive accuracy may be higher when the marker is measured closer to the time of disease occurrence. We therefore consider inference for sensitivity and specificity functions that are defined as functions of time. Semiparametric regression models are proposed. Data from a cohort study are used to estimate model parameters. One issue that arises in practice is that event times may be censored. In this research, we extend in several respects the work by Leisenring et al. (1997) that dealt only with parametric models for binary tests and uncensored data. We propose semiparametric models that accommodate continuous tests and censoring. Asymptotic distribution theory for parameter estimates is developed and procedures for making statistical inference are evaluated with simulation studies. We illustrate our methods with data from the Cardiovascular Health Study, relating the FR-score measured at enrollment to subsequent risk of cardiovascular events.","inCitations":["4ba22019ead629a140c53b162d2fe314ed0d56f1","76c3ae6b58f3c3504ef9f2327568d10cd6b64080","86d76874ed6637da0245ebbbae722dc175632c4d","5c0d5c0c4c0aba9e06c490d5bb9c7815af9e49ae","7460b690cfcedd357556e1f9531a5184c086cff1","c37d30f7162e7fec10a9bc3fd36277151c177c71","c2732965f883c99d45803377d0495787c6680ec3","8d843a9781a148d9ff52432490917a2f21951af8","902844897c5918c019e35c262b86ef4a0ba9088b","5e5fde7ba0728c52c77ded5d7653eb7f152881e1","ff71aff2b5614c7aa6d0971a34aa507413577554","1400609bd54acf17ebf1e4c1287dfbe7d149eefa","304c41a7e0a9cdce92c3fb65b2a8153de099b10e","89910215b108fdd4facba50cef8c5307dbbb7792","c3f77e3e9f94bf69b4d700fe6739417f14da6340","0a5b6425a9568e08f5a47e1165e288ed58a56ce5","dea8655562ce695df92e80d848b01ae4b94e7c60","b6d0413ab50130ce4947836e6fe5ee4259e53524","75123ed6976eb286f73919fc9cbcaf9d43805752","3e0bd77c9f8da9878109bcb99f7a4e5beb8edec1","a5b99c34e74978dfd7db30a8088198a191850843","7e705d9a1699c876a5b5253c9aaa8bbcba64dd1c","ab5eb9742a77b87a6b87c1fde181c30d6e1fe425","50357e6acf7d92a7a6e66c066246dfe5bb83d56e","e1adec248f0c7ee9ba34bddc675f02a3b021d556","071da3540ae927f4ec9ae1f3dc467d351a711359","e8b545eae3a836e8261f909b4f5457ecb76154fc","579111cd0a193b74dcc6854d8197ca9ab19cfa63","b7f58537b878a487201bfe2213a2b5cfc8b13792","1b3ddea65e35cecca7b2a481e65e27ff21b72612","15904caa75da9b29b28d48c481654559660aec63","e0f86a04e22973280c6774a893baedc8ef0245ee","63afe550d08cc48fa52e7e73c2d222abbfef16ca","13d562d7cf32011a5bc4ba961e91d94d09ebdb72","f0a51a99091275d4dbfe902ea5931feb1a41a8a7","62293af30f6250d09b6f160ae4411912d15eb8ae","dd92a4ad6e38e4b178a1a713ac18f1c5a2e7c431","0708cc82e4d21929a52a0dd6c8ff2560e61748be","ae3da88a2c9574bf8199dcb9d84726994b70a63d","f3526d73933147706225395b3ebe62861c942d94","0c9b703472c16b305cafc8406c791d0c30e1342e"],"title":"The sensitivity and specificity of markers for event times.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi047"}

As subjects with extreme high or low risk may be the most affected by knowledge of their risk estimates, checking the adequacy of risk models at the extremes of risk is very important for clinical applications. We propose a new approach to test model calibration targeted toward extremes of disease risk distribution where standard goodness-of-fit tests may lack power due to sparseness of data. We construct a test statistic based on model residuals summed over only those individuals who pass high and/or low risk thresholds and then maximize the test statistic over different risk thresholds. We derive an asymptotic distribution for the max-test statistic based on analytic derivation of the variance-covariance function of the underlying Gaussian process. The method is applied to a large case-control study of breast cancer to examine joint effects of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered through recent genome-wide association studies. The analysis clearly indicates a non-additive effect of the SNPs on the scale of absolute risk, but an excellent fit for the linear-logistic model even at the extremes of risks.","inCitations":["982479a5154b182392f6c3fca6674146bef9d875","870d0421232ab5c1e8d6e394612e1d3dada22635","a60f85745dc3aaa4ef3a1ed81ccab93c56893585","a5f582ec88b393d101a44edd5544686c7ccdf856","1280ed662960326a013468da3029157edcac4326","25a4e591f64c619f750947a2c43298db92cfd957","942ac2ba4fdc1c3a7a855869b34c98450e5d7708","54391c2d7c407f0bce118e453f2fc44132f93f67","4dcf3500e1b6a6177be6f4f05ec122432d7a1c83","dddbb98f930800dac1178d59123a8ff6ff1c461c","a68c96d5ae41f51e83660238f16c22cb58102275","ae055feb9efe5cdce6a9dc91755b436f9be94252","d63e0c2d959a3b9147ec390de5aca654002b3dfa","b65b9eeb4d45709117715cd24d4acd75c751a6cf","58266150ef7872ee950f6c91d4c4d55b51995fdc","1d8521a83dfad7484bee87bbf179602a2c7e5733","d20aa14c02432632bd00194c145a0deaa6a8c229"],"title":"Testing calibration of risk models at extremes of disease risk.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu034"}

The method is demonstrated with specific examples.","inCitations":["c81da758b2dd26410c4d915abd396d48c522c712","6658a34fd64d70f17fe54c4bf840510581902754","7430883b6c95377ef5cf6cf207ef53d860117f76","f312e274d134055d5689f7ef7e3ba84710699985","7789a7132f115cf6038c89dfe5dc6744b748c056","99b8e8ace64c353232e4013321017ee731769ab5","69c23c8b28552fec986838d28a9f12549497109b","38552f946347f3f5f88fae1b3fa049f6b61473af","78ef98c3ff9a0cfc99dc26a796785eb3b82b59f2","7e79355f7f8f62cbd20bbca44608f047da4e8a8e","534f28455ff27b17bbfff0c7cdeb6a1cc05a22c6","883bc47e9214b616c68ca0907f245230da6995a7","c220a3fec412d6acc887dd312ffd0655ba37737e","7a66e3c7c30fea6f2b801fec9e2f73cbef113270","ebd03cdce0948ffc1d1ea439cef09103569b8004","21156fc71d3e8dad72745f4402994b3553bb9fcf","b4542dcd2c098b5ee0ad518f0c16d4c4d763edf5","3e82f3a8e87960532e2f72b8afdd32d13612f617","e7706e6f6895cdee68f47170a720042d3f988178","83bf4fd012974a6c5149f1fa6d7c181b6e474ff2","df0845c54cd8699306b2217ea255e1d9b4c3aaa2","427e7017d0694ba0132e3bfd61fffdb1a3a8a68e","2011cdcf36a74907ebb58a1cd8a833a863164372","bd9d280c32662b8209fdf6b84e0db6b84dc8647e","84c8ed64f880fd98814bffdf95b2d125eb6dd75e","c3481b6f497d53871a47afa2477d796de3b91130","3fa6f79df152fddea5e2dea64b33b345e39930e8","c7e09fb435831bc8bff73ab1ad68fe4795108a1e","4a9731939f4f6b05e8e19f1d3e7e0e8cbeeb2652"],"title":"Universal Residuals: A Multivariate Transformation.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2007.02.008"}

The challenges arise when errors are heteroscedastic since we literally have only one observation for each error distribution. This paper concerns the estimation of smooth distribution function when data are contaminated with heteroscedastic errors. We study two types of methods to recover the unknown distribution function: a Fourier-type deconvolution method and a simulation extrapolation (SIMEX) method. The asymptotics of the two estimators are explored and the asymptotic pointwise confidence bands of the SIMEX estimator are obtained. The finite sample performances of the two estimators are evaluated through a simulation study. Finally, we illustrate the methods with medical rehabilitation data from a neuro-muscular electrical stimulation experiment.","inCitations":["f233ee4a16c1851ad0ef8778779b5c538c04396a","88b1b58b435450bd038381614cc00058f8ba3d52","82ffb0d1fce36445550f222c7a0a663d04d48651","729b43cc426bbd021d382b69f9b4bc31c1b86797","97bd7717569e35121046227acb6ce1217d82871a","30bde06dea15fb038267924e28299349712028ef","6a972debcc5133a9d5bc355bd9a7d73fe28ca577","d9c1a9eee43d933ab9cd8fcde5d5b2d1adc6a501","7115ebd91d3d3e9f88fbe3dabf2d253014be6f46","c9c24be8bf23cefba2269cd2941a01d657656607"],"title":"Estimating smooth distribution function in the presence of heteroscedastic measurement errors","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2009.08.012"}
