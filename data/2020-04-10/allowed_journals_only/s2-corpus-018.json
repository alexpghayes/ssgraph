To gain information at the level of single items, MTMM models for categorical variables have to be applied. The CTC(M-1) model is presented as an example of an MTMM model for ordinal variables. Based on an empirical application of the CTC(M-1) model, a complex simulation study was conducted to examine the sample size requirements of the robust weighted least squares mean- and variance-adjusted chi(2) test of model fit (WLSMV estimator) implemented in Mplus. In particular, the simulation study analysed the chi(2) approximation, the parameter estimation bias, the standard error bias, and the reliability of the WLSMV estimator depending on the varying number of items per trait-method unit (ranging from 2 to 8) and varying sample sizes (250, 500, 750, and 1000 observations). The results showed that the WLSMV estimator provided a good -- albeit slightly liberal -- chi(2) approximation and stable and reliable parameter estimates for models of reasonable complexity (2-4 items) and small sample sizes (at least 250 observations). When more complex models with 5 or more items were analysed, larger sample sizes of at least 500 observations were needed. The most complex model with 9 trait-method units and 8 items (72 observed variables) requires sample sizes of at least 1000 observations.","inCitations":["3a795243cf2ae466e3f199ecf4df1b4df89d1ef1","044b419c91d7a2110ac8fa7c251f187903bd083e","10e808ca5274e1fb35fef909958d8280964da86d","b49ab39e59e7cc82f994f5d01526a92dc5449195","e730f324f9d1ec342c5609431ce1a14a90916877","7f1321cbcba7d87dc8198d80f015e92a2ad0c329","82a31b1df7e5a3685ec9c4779a30a0719bb2589e","61d23c14af28a49e8054487ecf5337610f0c0f0f","3b5821b32d1ff8688010683fb10aaf8e1836be6c","b5a95666c6800f4a5ce2ce62b9c22d73d39e6f99","b39471da397e2fa1cb83ef948aee66589078db74","f4536abec3178ac0415969b61e63412b8312628b","1243cde1e853f6809070aa9981c260f14c844dc5","1f2a0f58346afc26fd59636e65a5c8947b477736","ce45d95fcb5f5092a9076fbdf8896f67ad486ad1","f42b375a16ecc1440b0684f59d2fa93bb1c6a8b3","2d45084575b72c2ec37850c364f8485e104550d1","0055ab66194b0901aaa9fc1da3ddf8ebcd5f904e","227c65ec8dc043a62b3315ad0fd79b4600254698","25bc92d0fb6adafee84c16d3b486529fdbb4337d","5bbbeb1696c517fbd428c4318ad181b8278de5c4","383333f4b5abdaf4f67e09343548f7e0930524cb","348a35ab7c68613ce5bfb1c4e5fa3e2e4a4d070f","2d415ce078fc549c2d53a06b45994d5a1ab1f1bc","825e431f4719400f48b522277578764969ade969","a8c8b4c69f54f49848e35c5558df094f5525db4b","a70e2e456e4cd749b8c72f0bc75ba83c87a90049","f871b7fb454d94cda2ee6d94810f699d0774fb07","6d173471632efb3fb4ccfa7e697e7b2fbe5b5f7a","d5c587e858d83d2a378bac47e13e756f4458f5ad","273a255c2060eb5a08653f1f717ba6c26a0173fb","6c33a198364cc4fcb6b532e6f9ed70c4855d4154","978450b107e41d031a0d8fc0b861afaa7f0cdd4b","a45b16e2f18a7edd8f04454df972542c92fc73da","3e9635a4630e49fd976733c584770f01636c4f0c","97ec45ce558901bdc8d336212a7fee91f9263330","16b901ca2456b22662fe1159944602b45d472c0f","f039e78c0698f7db51e170126dcc235c09f46c3c"],"title":"Analysing multitrait-multimethod data with structural equation models for ordinal variables applying the WLSMV estimator: what sample size is needed for valid results?","doi":"10.1348/000711005X67490"}

The expected amount of heterogeneity can vary from modest (e.g. a typical meta-analysis), to large (e.g. a strong gene-environment interaction). However, existing statistical tools are limited in their ability to address such heterogeneity. Indeed, most genetic association meta-analyses use a \"fixed effects\" analysis, which assumes no heterogeneity. Here we develop and apply Bayesian association methods to address this problem. These methods are easy to apply (in the simplest case, requiring only a point estimate for the genetic effect, and its standard error, from each subgroup), and effectively include standard frequentist meta-analysis methods, including the usual \"fixed effects\" analysis, as special cases. We apply these tools to two large genetic association studies: one a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from the Global Lipids consortium, and the second a cross-population analysis for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). In the Global Lipids data we find, perhaps surprisingly, that effects are generally quite homogeneous across studies. In the eQTL study we find that eQTLs are generally shared among different continental groups, and discuss consequences of this for study design.","inCitations":["3582bea873386a0c74366055fb35615cf0f42d69","44c80300b3688a14ab2d52293bbb09fdf3f355b0","310e6a925850a80ccc5c29f813c71f666a14fa39","fdf5578b445cb5cbd29e798687616ad5e5d4ca2d","ac0d267d142702948752a6e4fcf4a2699ba564d4","24e363aba1ec5d510fd285d227dbc74d09c257e7","0d61b68f5ea16fe1bb8d25eddb4a2ea4fe38ebc9","ce1ce8f32f72f0373d6b2f7b445bb8830273d84e","f397c202c3a9f1e519149d75c76b614483810f36","2f9c3eaa09c1b5590977a713601dc55238592aa2","9a17919aed460f59dbcf4d280fd601598995f35e","8f32b2cbd8c0fdd135b99fbb70142da72c227757","a9cef1d0413fe15dab0070f0b2911a1900e0c5ee","6b5a006e964a70cf18477a9f42695c75e0ec927f","d1f2d78bf551b97e4c6e0a522d40ce837265c683","2e70ed221ccbaf571b27d9afb9daf3e99403b564","7c392d2bb94834b282361d009ce02e6f5e202767","31eb8d8c0e6691f77bea7b340879b0fbab45fb30","901719baba46ad8a7a2b61c46bd2f23445013606","f05520a0cf2a81c79bc66fe9f9def6bc0b2d9873","5ea36241a1f9c1789ed3bf3c7b2a2a6cb704f526","bd4acb3fd591bfcf412bf21bf52d1964281a1271","410046116fb4d00097fce17c875d76db6f84c0f6","76edc23f0643412dc6c10bc195cbd19375b4d741","afb644fc02a01534e0022b0218e779d1052e61da","95fd390ca50f34ade3af5298773025b8eadfb369","d3ec33be99af74612a53bd36cae273125f8fa727","351d1c368c89d288021a84d88392587e3c5e7573","59f3357605348b8c97256257aadae07861035aca","fd2a40f6131a516b2f7f30c62a74c102436bdfda","e6c3eca9b17713283d60fc3cbb1ee0be3137cb0b","9a0bb671c6a280c9f8e9f3c9bdb95b56b2ac2969","137c6393eb294d032a8bf17d5542ad7741bea638","01a8f0b6d619d8c2846ae8c5b9135798cc4e8230","4f9dd93bee1ae2b24b0120d1fdafcffbc6a08907","1928353a1c8040a5cb79c73ca52ce151a98bef69","aefdf6761cde0ef3ade4ae3345407fe398d451cd","7d41658501a991bc82b1adbe25ba1b534caf1d93","b8570bb220b772e974cbc8256baf7bf2127393b7","408643bb0931b23b0bfd3a02e7bb99abe127b6ea"],"title":"Bayesian Methods for Genetic Association Analysis with Heterogeneous Subgroups: from Meta-analyses to Gene-environment Interactions.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS695"}

In many settings, researchers are confronted with spatially‐indexed data where the relative locations of the observational units may serve as a useful proxy for unmeasured confounding that varies according to a spatial pattern. We develop a new method, termed distance adjusted propensity score matching (DAPSm) that incorporates information on units' spatial proximity into a propensity score matching procedure. We show that DAPSm can adjust for both observed and some forms of unobserved confounding and evaluate its performance relative to several other reasonable alternatives for incorporating spatial information into propensity score adjustment. The method is motivated by and applied to a comparative effectiveness investigation of power plant emission reduction technologies designed to reduce population exposure to ambient ozone pollution. Ultimately, DAPSm provides a framework for augmenting a “standard” propensity score analysis with information on spatial proximity and provides a transparent and principled way to assess the relative trade‐offs of prioritizing observed confounding adjustment versus spatial proximity adjustment.","inCitations":["e5bb491576a23c63ecb696b7fbb934f87f131cf0","e5f575f8c8c78c29160c041a2891423c3e9a2d28","d950f5f91a330d36b8cf5d7463c3bf584fd334ed","ffe56110c5e0fb9b561edfbfb45008087fb69640","629a4dedd282cc706fbd3fb396982f08d25a79d6","c26d3d4374e5a12f82972c44db97ccf6d5119091","47494234340f9f3cdcbc9a53852c83156b18a95e","0da50905b4e02aab8986713bf42b416c70d0e724","41af2f2f80baa4c41ef3a31013d59b5711ba366f"],"title":"Adjusting for unmeasured spatial confounding with distance adjusted propensity score matching","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx074"}

In a full rank linear model analysis the model equation, E[Y] = Xβ, leads to the definition of the primary parameter β = (X'X)(-1)X'E[Y], and the definition of linear secondary parameters of the form θ = Lβ = L(X'X)(-1)X'E[Y], including, for example, a parameter representing a \"treatment effect.\" These parameters depend explicitly on E[Y], which raises the questions: What is E[Y] when some elements of the incomplete random vector Y are not observed and MNAR, or when such a Y is \"completed\" via imputation? We develop a rigorous, readily interpretable definition of E[Y] in this context that leads directly to definitions of β, Bias(β) = E[β] - β, Bias(θ) = E[θ] - Lβ, and the extent of hypothesis corruption. These definitions provide a basis for evaluating, comparing, and removing biases induced by various linear imputation methods for MNAR incomplete data from longitudinal clinical trials. Linear imputation methods use earlier data from a subject to impute values for post-dropout missing values and include \"Last Observation Carried Forward\" (LOCF) and \"Baseline Observation Carried Forward\" (BOCF), among others. We illustrate the methods of evaluating, comparing, and removing biases and the effects of testing corresponding corrupted hypotheses via a hypothetical but very realistic longitudinal analgesic clinical trial.","inCitations":["00e2efabe35f9b546b1861dfc0627766bf9a0956","d08e905fdd9cd851e1b91b3756ba9ebf01c9d549"],"title":"Defining, evaluating, and removing bias induced by linear imputation in longitudinal clinical trials with MNAR missing data.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.550097"}

Thus, medical research in cancer is an important public health interest. Understanding how medical improvements are affecting cancer incidence, mortality and survival is critical for effective cancer control. In this paper, we study the cancer survival trend on the population level cancer data. In particular, we develop a parametric Bayesian joinpoint regression model based on a Poisson distribution for the relative survival. To avoid identifying the cause of death, we only conduct analysis based on the relative survival. The method is further extended to the semiparametric Bayesian joinpoint regression models wherein the parametric distributional assumptions of the joinpoint regression models are relaxed by modeling the distribution of regression slopes using Dirichlet process mixtures. We also consider the effect of adding covariates of interest in the joinpoint model. Three model selection criteria, namely, the conditional predictive ordinate (CPO), the expected predictive deviance (EPD), and the deviance information criteria (DIC), are used to select the number of joinpoints. We analyze the grouped survival data for distant testicular cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program using these Bayesian models.","inCitations":["7018eed411dfc3b8924c5f29d04ca0b5387acfff","21f874b368df2d20a274c6c8e224c24f0ecbfde3","b83f5a37f48b9771d0593772bdd164ef7c5d0a28","2d65422d6bf5e775312f342ca84b7de6b3791906","c52d5edf7b820f5561bd7ff3b25743a8ac1b2806"],"title":"Semiparametric Bayesian approaches to joinpoint regression for population-based cancer survival data","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2009.04.011"}

In such trials, a maximum likelihood estimate is often adopted to describe the difference in efficacy between the experimental and reference treatments; however, this method is known to display conditional bias. To reduce such bias, a conditional mean-adjusted estimator (CMAE) has been proposed, although the remaining bias may be nonnegligible when a trial is stopped for efficacy at the interim analysis. We propose a new estimator for adjusting the conditional bias of the treatment effect by extending the idea of the CMAE. This estimator is calculated by weighting the maximum likelihood estimate obtained at the interim analysis and the effect size prespecified when calculating the sample size. We evaluate the performance of the proposed estimator through analytical and simulation studies in various settings in which a trial is stopped for efficacy or futility at the interim analysis. We find that the conditional bias of the proposed estimator is smaller than that of the CMAE when the information time at the interim analysis is small. In addition, the mean-squared error of the proposed estimator is also smaller than that of the CMAE. In conclusion, we recommend the use of the proposed estimator for trials that are terminated early for efficacy or futility.","inCitations":["2138f982f5efa848608c4560fba16af5cf50318f"],"title":"Conditional estimation using prior information in 2-stage group sequential designs assuming asymptotic normality when the trial terminated early.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1859"}

For example, this practice was used until 2008 in the case of GRE(®) General Analytical Writing and until 2009 in the case of TOEFL(®) iBT Writing. With use of natural language processing, it is possible to obtain additional information concerning item responses from computer programs such as e-rater(®). In addition, available information relevant to examinee performance may include scores on related tests. We suggest application of standard results from classical test theory to the available data to obtain best linear predictors of true traditional test scores. In performing such analysis, we require estimation of variances and covariances of measurement errors, a task which can be quite difficult in the case of tests with limited numbers of items and with multiple measurements per item. As a consequence, a new estimation method is suggested based on samples of examinees who have taken an assessment more than once. Such samples are typically not random samples of the general population of examinees, so that we apply statistical adjustment methods to obtain the needed estimated variances and covariances of measurement errors. To examine practical implications of the suggested methods of analysis, applications are made to GRE General Analytical Writing and TOEFL iBT Writing. Results obtained indicate that substantial improvements are possible both in terms of reliability of scoring and in terms of assessment reliability.","inCitations":["f18da4b074289abe93751c718089e715c4830cc2"],"title":"Prediction of true test scores from observed item scores and ancillary data.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12052"}

Specifically, the joint likelihood is modeled through a two-parameter Archimedean copula, which can flexibly characterize the dependence between the two margins in both tails. The marginal distributions are modeled through semiparametric transformation models using sieves, with the proportional hazards or odds model being a special case. We develop a computationally efficient sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the unknown parameters, together with a generalized score test for the regression parameter(s). For the proposed sieve estimators of finite-dimensional parameters, we establish their asymptotic normality and efficiency. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in finite samples.

We propose a supervised technique to incorporate the clinical outcome to determine a score, which is a linear combination of variables with hieratical structures to multimodalities. This approach is expected to obtain interpretable and predictive scores. The proposed method was applied to a study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a diagnostic method for AD that involves using whole‐brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), and we select effective brain regions for the diagnostic probability and investigate the genome‐wide association with the regions using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The two‐step dimension reduction method, which we previously introduced, was considered applicable to such a study and allows us to partially incorporate the proposed method. We show that the proposed method offers classification functions with feasibility and reasonable prediction accuracy based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and reasonable regions of the brain and genomes. Our simulation study based on the synthetic structured data set showed that the proposed method outperformed the original method and provided the characteristic for the supervised feature.","inCitations":["0303d5f59eefb37a0fe2ddcf6fe48cf4aa93fd3d","13653c06f1cecd84cc692f6195c33cc9b849139c"],"title":"Supervised multiblock sparse multivariable analysis with application to multimodal brain imaging genetics","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx011"}

By adaptive design, we mean in this setting a RCT design that allows the investigator to dynamically modify its course through data-driven adjustment of the randomization probability based on data accrued so far without negatively impacting on the statistical integrity of the trial. By adaptive group sequential design, we refer to the fact that group sequential testing methods can be equally well applied on top of adaptive designs. The simulation study validates the theory. It notably shows in the estimation framework that the confidence intervals we obtain achieve the desired coverage even for moderate sample sizes. In addition, it shows in the testing framework that type I error control at the prescribed level is guaranteed and that all sampling procedures only suffer from a very slight increase of the type II error. A three-sentence take-home message is “Adaptive designs do learn the targeted optimal design and inference and testing can be carried out under adaptive sampling as they would under the targeted optimal randomization probability iid sampling. In particular, adaptive designs achieve the same efficiency as the fixed oracle design. This is confirmed by a simulation study, at least for moderate or large sample sizes, across a large collection of targeted randomization probabilities.”","inCitations":["209928f2019676a868b7f0becd4da023e77a086c","2beef38f5a3b7a2fd52e64d2b5a7f7cebc5479b4","0f0ad2626fdaa25b336ddd2f9ab071cfaf18b544","a8e7b5d20dea4ca311a6d6dd55e5d2fe022ba0f0","55b133c5fc2f118b3ae80b45520b4e7a26dc503a","9263f291f0e50212fb62aeb43a4d59088f188a12","22ede5ecd73ea793ab020456b4b5f9aeba48160c","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c","1b3824f6f96041bab23e29c8ea929fbe3dff2ac8","4c97c095bc4d9bcee2717270c8cfe36a128460a1"],"title":"Targeting the Optimal Design in Randomized Clinical Trials with Binary Outcomes and No Covariate: Simulation Study","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1310"}

However, to date, no computational evidence has been provided regarding the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of such approaches. This paper presents an evaluation of an integer linear programming method for asymmetric seriation using five moderately sized matrices (15 < or = n < or = 36) from the psychological literature, as well as 80 synthetic matrices (20 < or = n < or = 30). The solution to the linear programming relaxation of the integer-programming model was integer-optimal for each of the five empirical matrices and many of the synthetic matrices. In such instances, branch-and-bound integer programming was not required and optimal orderings were obtained within a few seconds. In all cases where the solution to the linear programming relaxation was not integer-optimal, branch-and-bound integer programming was able to find an optimal seriation in 18 minutes or less. A pragmatic solution strategy for larger matrices (n > 30) is also presented. This approach exploits the fact that, in many instances, only a modest percentage of all possible transitivity constraints are required to obtain an optimal solution.","inCitations":["e79c6204be5630a3170cf4eb59b6dbcf9cf918b8","fdb314ddd6d34bb8b2cf5dd018060e386c57ece7"],"title":"Seriation of asymmetric matrices using integer linear programming.","doi":"10.1348/000711001159500"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2011,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Computational statistics & data analysis","paperAbstract":"Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) is one of the most popular uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques. It uses a periodic sampling approach and a Fourier transformation to decompose the variance of a model output into partial variances contributed by different model parameters. Until now, the FAST analysis is mainly confined to the estimation of partial variances contributed by the main effects of model parameters, but does not allow for those contributed by specific interactions among parameters. In this paper, we theoretically show that FAST analysis can be used to estimate partial variances contributed by both main effects and interaction effects of model parameters using different sampling approaches (i.e., traditional search-curve based sampling, simple random sampling and random balance design sampling). We also analytically calculate the potential errors and biases in the estimation of partial variances. Hypothesis tests are constructed to reduce the effect of sampling errors on the estimation of partial variances. Our results show that compared to simple random sampling and random balance design sampling, sensitivity indices (ratios of partial variances to variance of a specific model output) estimated by search-curve based sampling generally have higher precision but larger underestimations. Compared to simple random sampling, random balance design sampling generally provides higher estimation precision for partial variances contributed by the main effects of parameters. The theoretical derivation of partial variances contributed by higher-order interactions and the calculation of their corresponding estimation errors in different sampling schemes can help us better understand the FAST method and provide a fundamental basis for FAST applications and further improvements.","inCitations":["d62c68d7c745541600298db477b062dc042ca88c","2b82c2e1290edd92981a34a8d791d9787c769761","5fe6d25c673c438d0b6741115fcb127f33788e7c","36083f5dc81503a762e876f77556249070025840","231e8066502c8c6fb2ed4b9f8c5db1fe0463e288","da31e3aee4c18c8b49294ddf9fa84c0ba99bbdb9","5a59b912be20127badacf800750c0811922886db","cdec0ae3dcc26b53b0f709b4ca4876bd26b760b3","5ee21e95c9c80219cc081b7da238a0ddbafd10db","515e6bc8c85b4e3616a46f8cdbeb0208457edf20","54c14c4b1760d2380a2b5092f78e3de8401e153c","5cd66316598ecd1d7165d15e45211bf22148e260","960cd736f6849fa0080d2cb128f19239801f544b","0ce99e0535814bde47faee33f91e72456ccf2a54","e38a61738861120c2e8d1090fd73bcea8217b12e","7826a8c35ae2e64a8f9bfb3cb166c277757e1057","2f1ee76f674b20aae5874802f9070c0c7e513441","a0213ec4e0144d5c174cf17abad2663267c2e775","632aa31e2f7083efe31dba6b5c8b089395cc9ee1"],"title":"Understanding and comparisons of different sampling approaches for the Fourier Amplitudes Sensitivity Test (FAST)","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2010.06.028"}

Often the data take the form of a series of predictor vectors, each of which must be compared with a single response vector, perhaps with nuisance covariates. Parametric tests of association are often used, but can result in inaccurate type I error at the extreme thresholds, even for large sample sizes. Furthermore, standard two-sided testing can reduce power compared with the doubled [Formula: see text]-value, due to asymmetry in the null distribution. Exact (permutation) testing is attractive, but can be computationally intensive and cumbersome. We present an approximation to exact association tests of trend that is accurate and fast enough for standard use in high-throughput settings, and can easily provide standard two-sided or doubled [Formula: see text]-values. The approach is shown to be equivalent under permutation to likelihood ratio tests for the most commonly used generalized linear models (GLMs). For linear regression, covariates are handled by working with covariate-residualized responses and predictors. For GLMs, stratified covariates can be handled in a manner similar to exact conditional testing. Simulations and examples illustrate the wide applicability of the approach.

The latter is often considered an intrinsic property of the marker; it is independent of disease prevalence and hence more likely to be similar across populations than risk prediction measures. In this paper, we are interested in evaluating the population-specific performance of a risk prediction marker in terms of positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) at given thresholds, when samples are available from the target population as well as from another population. A default strategy is to estimate PPV and NPV using samples from the target population only. However, when the marker's classification accuracy as characterized by a specific point on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve is similar across populations, borrowing information across populations allows increased efficiency in estimating PPV and NPV. We develop estimators that optimally combine information across populations. We apply this methodology to a cross-sectional study where we evaluate PCA3 as a risk prediction marker for prostate cancer among subjects with or without previous negative biopsy.","inCitations":["f02987a3e159bf03cc9ce8b7ef2036c19a4f5f72"],"title":"Borrowing Information across Populations in Estimating Positive and Negative Predictive Values.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2011.00761.x"}

Viral dynamic models can be formulated through differential equations, but there has been only limited development of statistical methodologies for estimating such models or assessing their agreement with observed data. This paper develops a mechanism-based nonlinear differential equation models for characterizing long-term viral dynamics with ARV therapy. In this model we not only incorporate clinical factors (drug exposures and susceptibility), but also baseline covariate (baseline viral load, CD4 count, weight or age) into a function of treatment efficacy. A Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach is investigated with application to an AIDS clinical trial study. The effects of confounding interaction of clinical factors with covariate-based models are compared using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), a Bayesian version of the classical deviance for model assessment, designed from complex hierarchical model settings. Relationships between baseline covariate combined with confounding clinical factors and drug efficacy are explored. In addition, we compared models incorporating each of four baseline covariates through DIC and some interesting findings are presented. Our results suggest that modeling HIV dynamics and virologic responses with consideration of time-varying clinical factors as well as baseline characteristics may play an important role in understanding HIV pathogenesis, designing new treatment strategies for long-term care of AIDS patients.","inCitations":["26d29fe0d5708768f8969ff0015ea918397b0580","894d47968641fbb721f81998e3625b8f535c4216","6f7078158883b46813d2d3056c4454f133fc4601"],"title":"A Bayesian Approach in Differential Equation Dynamic Models Incorporating Clinical Factors and Covariates.","doi":"10.1080/02664760802578320"}

The biological mechanism of drug responses indicates that a gene-based analysis has even greater potential in pharmacogenetics. Motivated by a study from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) trial, we develop a gene-trait similarity regression for survival analysis to assess the effect of a gene or pathway on time-to-event outcomes. The similarity regression has a general framework that covers a range of survival models, such as the proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model. The inference procedure developed under the proportional hazards model is robust against model misspecification. We derive the equivalence between the similarity survival regression and a random effects model, which further unifies the current variance-component based methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulation studies. In addition, we apply the method to the VISP trial data to identify the genes that exhibit an association with the risk of a recurrent stroke. TCN2 gene was found to be associated with the recurrent stroke risk in the low-dose arm. This gene may impact recurrent stroke risk in response to cofactor therapy.","inCitations":["a9820783646c734e6f7633f1eac119789aa537de","171a1845fd13d7cd98c3a589965c2f5aa6622515","f418b0d1ed48a9473d98a557bc8cf467628ed90e","704d41f3e672935d72bc47aeb2fbb83557937cc0","4c8351e2b80e46fa694e095fda5cc3fadf68457f"],"title":"Gene-level Pharmacogenetic Analysis on Survival Outcomes Using Gene-trait Similarity Regression.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS735"}

This paper presents a case study on unemployment and mortality, based on the complete Danish male population aged 20-64 years at the 1970 census. The effect of unemployment on the age-specific mortality rate is intermediate between additive and multiplicative and was fitted well by an additive effect on the square root of the mortality. The paper discusses and illustrates whether finer stratification or random residual variation ('frailty') is to be preferred for obtaining a statistically satisfactory fit.\"","inCitations":["7bf0c26dfbf0789c5e52117eadd47fe49c3a90ce","8666d1dc07f144cdb449cc5ae004d033922b5e2d"],"title":"Modelling excess mortality of the unemployed: choice of scale and extra-Poisson variability.","doi":"10.2307/2347812"}
