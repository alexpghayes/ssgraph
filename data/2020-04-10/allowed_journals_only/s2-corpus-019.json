This paper proposes a variable selection procedure for the PLM with ultrahigh dimensional predictors. The proposed method is different from the existing penalized least squares procedure in that it relies on partial correlation between the partial residuals of the response and the predictors. We systematically study the theoretical properties of the proposed procedure and prove its model consistency property. We further establish the root-n convergence of the estimator of the regression coefficients and the asymptotic normality of the estimate of the baseline function. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed procedure and illustrate the proposed method with a real data example.","inCitations":["e1a54d4600a83dd3779edeee40897a9c46ce848d"],"title":"Variable selection for partially linear models via partial correlation","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2018.06.005"}

For example, growth charts may be constructed for each of a collection of variables, to identify those for which individuals with a disorder tend to fall in the tails of their age-specific distribution; such variables might serve as developmental biomarkers. When such a large set of analyses are carried out by penalized spline smoothing, reliable automatic selection of the smoothing parameter is particularly important. We show that two popular methods for smoothness selection may tend to overfit when estimating extreme quantiles as a smooth function of a predictor such as age; and that improved results can be obtained by multifold cross-validation or by a novel likelihood approach. A simulation study, and an application to a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set, demonstrate the favorable performance of our methods.","inCitations":["dc59acb6dc67069c512abe6e68841fb9b75b1063","4702fc0c49c4c9b6976a06bd477582c275c90f0b","ffc1eba086ca183e1fb90c730afaf95c46d1059f","acae9dba9a92d7466e08642ac2608f4f84c82206","7757d84bf881ef1f8f4cacea4952e31912dcfb33","1a343de9591cf3f97ce4ec56c353b031b4da6f29","25538bcaf9e2aa3bdff91063404e2c86ea8ded03","531e7d9e4235325e63718f37a9d6b9d2df88103b","324d922a51879cbf6a10430bb83c4b6be27a6e9f"],"title":"Smoothness Selection for Penalized Quantile Regression Splines","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1381"}

Therefore, compared to the traditional dose-finding design, this adaptive design can reduce the sample size by not carrying over all doses to the end of the trial or dropping the losers earlier. However, all the doses have to be explored. For unimodal (including linear or umbrella) response curves, we proposed an effective dose-finding design that allows adding arms at the interim analysis. The trial design starts with two arms, depending on the response of the two arms and the unimodality assumption; we can decide which new arms to be added. This design does not require exploring all arms (doses) to find the best responsive dose; therefore, it can further reduce the sample size from the drop-loser design by as much as 10-20%.","inCitations":["96e4f5aa6a7008d2a0b06269a7fc34fd644b78fb","f3da1413a7101395d71f24c02d54ba1e78b0a254","ff958ff1005ed1a1f5d05f65562d5497545b2862","a107a4fffa5c5c0ebd70a3d676097f291887fc5a"],"title":"The Add-Arm Design for Unimodal Response Curve with Unknown Mode.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.971164"}

Dayton has recently proposed a new approach to pairwise multiple comparisons testing that eliminates intransitivity through a model selection procedure. The present study compared the model selection approach (and a protected version) with three powerful and easy-to-use stepwise multiple comparison procedures in terms of the proportion of times that the procedure identified the true pattern of differences among a set of means across several one-way layouts. The protected version of the model selection approach selected the true model a significantly greater proportion of times than the stepwise procedures and, in most cases, was not affected by variance heterogeneity and non-normality.","inCitations":["1a0e4aa4d1392fb8b9ec450243e2de5f7e76677b","d3349526c655aa8e8b11dc953882f5130f546ecc","c9000729fd844eabe31a0a9f4cf1a71b39b76fb5","cbcb54ab186d49bd234beda1729c0e8d262f2dc0","93b1bbeeee6a8adfd2c4ffeacb775368f1634d0e","ef9d413729e16966ba2fac60be6dfacaabecb9ee","7951195f059aa68d2fe534646a677dc1b2d80d37","50f03ae412080c965112e4855824ba593db77eb9","e1966e3c367c96bdcbffa8750e10d53c5b66f639"],"title":"Pairwise multiple comparisons: a model comparison approach versus stepwise procedures.","doi":"10.1348/000711003321645412"}

When the within-population variance of exposure is limited, however, power of the individual-data analysis is reduced. In such situations, aggregated-data analyses of disease data across populations, with a sample of individual exposure data from each population, can be powerful in estimating the exposure effect if between-population variation of exposure is large. In this paper, we consider a new analytical framework that is a combination of the individual- and aggregated-data analyses, based on an estimating equation approach. The proposed analysis utilizes strengths from individual data and aggregated data in the estimation of the exposure effect of interest, depending on which of the exposure variations (within- versus between-population) dominates. Simulation studies under various different scenarios were performed to show the strengths of the proposed approach in the estimation of the exposure effects of interest.","inCitations":["f9cff488d02f3744e96741b8c0d757ce19ade0cb","13a77f715023549469a812286ae67c2b854a529c","556605fd0728a2b9166e4abe9bd1089a9f5ac34a","151abce1142cc37b75eaff0379dc982fa3aa90ce","7f2c9854cd9fca2e82e62b9171c1247a3cc9bb4b","f2b3241e362f892c372ed9cd8af67e02defe9f32"],"title":"An Integrated Analysis of Individual and Aggregated Health Data Using Estimating Equations","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1060"}

Exposure assessment studies have shown that data from monitors at central sites may not adequately represent personal exposure. Thus, the exposure error resulting from using centrally measured data as a surrogate for personal exposure can potentially lead to a bias in estimates of the health effects of air pollution. This paper develops a multi-stage Poisson regression model for evaluating the effects of exposure measurement error on estimates of effects of particulate air pollution on mortality in time-series studies. To implement the model, we have used five validation data sets on personal exposure to PM10. Our goal is to combine data on the associations between ambient concentrations of particulate matter and mortality for a specific location, with the validation data on the association between ambient and personal concentrations of particulate matter at the locations where data have been collected. We use these data in a model to estimate the relative risk of mortality associated with estimated personal-exposure concentrations and make a comparison with the risk of mortality estimated with measurements of ambient concentration alone. We apply this method to data comprising daily mortality counts, ambient concentrations of PM10measured at a central site, and temperature for Baltimore, Maryland from 1987 to 1994. We have selected our home city of Baltimore to illustrate the method; the measurement error correction model is general and can be applied to other appropriate locations.Our approach uses a combination of: (1) a generalized additive model with log link and Poisson error for the mortality-personal-exposure association; (2) a multi-stage linear model to estimate the variability across the five validation data sets in the personal-ambient-exposure association; (3) data augmentation methods to address the uncertainty resulting from the missing personal exposure time series in Baltimore. In the Poisson regression model, we account for smooth seasonal and annual trends in mortality using smoothing splines. Taking into account the heterogeneity across locations in the personal-ambient-exposure relationship, we quantify the degree to which the exposure measurement error biases the results toward the null hypothesis of no effect, and estimate the loss of precision in the estimated health effects due to indirectly estimating personal exposures from ambient measurements.","inCitations":["7bcf600f6e8265c75e684eff35e1c0f24cbe216c","2e2f26b218da021164a6f797064443d4882e5332","55b2e28b8da788270732427d3cf5dbdfc0004656","044d675ac176a24190f151aa46855bbfb4aa6671","392f5a676a4149d03700547725a567f0077528af","7d007d6a4d031cf7a62db2b4e37f0eb122c60aee","f86bd6970e9b754c570214fc555163593269a50a","c88acf4ac6606e3110162395c942e3439e5c0c9b","540d5bcaf51659ecffce290bc372cddfd4a6ab74","b961867d25990c9ad0debc57b61d3d9a72f694dc","148a1b2f277fbdf7ead43c1371e3a87bb8c4b69b","e516601ae61b3060b5910f8cda92942b59f58e61","d8387a6deadcad979152a705715d6638485a25be","f2eed8943250beea8d03f681e850229f3a7e1e49","ba1876ab3e6d4e90087da56b4c596c8e0ae6cc16","4cf5d18242faffd0f9b10a6d47ced70c039f1c59","9be95880bc81ffbb350a90db8316e031a47e08e0","ee4c50365c1fd3793988e019cc47e41e9424e443","2d8b8202eec4c368031990ef8150a1f93b1aa12f","db8437a09f5499d7d7af60da64948ed9539b95c1","6eeece9dda0a397d3c8a1ba72b93552d3139819a","2ca2c72efc0d8ffe03ed1f206de84a870421d4cc","7859e443d6843cde6f398b13c1716ba5558cd6d4","0387b29149abe4e22a9402dbc054aa6b4bf463c9","1d2957d7d029414b082c7a0391bae6a9a8228c86","604eecd0ec4d90efb88366c1a8e2112b1fc63674","70601337259c629375ab812affb556835cc7fb61","fd4274531baa6c17c62b4c6a48669084adbd7450","37fd1363090ec4055013930359f685d21fa00503","fea9437ea32ec1a4d3aebc159c4ddf8aebacf9f3","9cb7bddf8b914489a6bce45d8979fe33dc760d80","b5cbb169e677f82a7794ef0d4236a4e486cc4400","e54941f6ad48955dc724ae0d383c81e425db37e3","0dcf480fb805a15a288e6f7154482f35b54bcd1c","fdc6be6c2956e3688cec4fd93661c975a461ed23","9b2b284241ffd336d4fc361745efcaaeac312b9d","d716dca5add503ad0c241c38f1b06601299a9867","8ecd41b6a63986b43d25f31f7716583df5ae59b3","cbc877035ce570ba12affe0916b1a06a387d1224","a9d7e2702ae42495b4baeb31ae27362316458bad","6ab99e918ea8190d8afafc0b6272af5c8efa92a1","b1b6441248f5ab11e2356795fdd799f3073e9372","329ebcc8ef85e91b34d3922094fae18467294551","51fe4336dd554ff1a744afde29f1ae216de85d4a","672ae0be4999099073a72982810311ed185aaf6e","e4e40e99a4962368f83ce97294252aae768cc5bf","ed314086444143ca2c5d62176948a63f9644e657","9030bff466dc6a0a812459acaa60efd9aae6d386","e925c432e17e0d8cd46264b114ccede041b22cee","250d85b54a0554f16f3e7a826d1f6775a2cda890","f665cf34e05730301ef349c5fd79707c32091007","ba75266fe16eae9bc9495ea9a182986430e224c2","930280bc023a3273db5f8a88b6c59f86e93d6a56","72d74b5b5dfe7aa66c06462e90d56c65af26efce","a21d320b032f7548a7d06ed6edd8077f1653f98b","0bbf9565892698ffd5da3d17c4f3991a38201250","39f27a1b36c5306d9bd1fd20019bcd9773c1f8cc","642a1ed1d236ad9326948b748b849e03efd26431","31fde26beb39de351f0c90d7117dd7935dbe4a40","2ec7bace322211540ac5b5054e1f233f8b87e267","31e6bec78cb52eaf3988965bc8da87d713329baa","bd654302d2e5af3a4721e514b1c291166138f0da","71360a329713b157015847ad33a874279a358b0b","b9915b56d795e65fcf0700d52f6f8c830ae39d0f","0c2f49a240b096a324831ce64f411366623fb6fa","591800b078fb34575e6131aca1ee727ce0d78f83","8c4948a315992bf8813b246a6362fabe09fe1260","14917d7f9f7db4262f3b5c438232dfc2d03c0b5a","e001e5ec9338c8029e656a5dc442ef81a3f24178","04c60a14a97f566b4c773baad402e7d5e74f37a5","55ed45e863ef106fed02eeb678e2ff2e5dfefec8","c90e1e163a7f51c74ca1b2d50c1653976138fab0","ac87212e6ab2e635a95c90953c38d5ef442922bf","1de694f82edf2d85d181baea8b37bcf895178b52","2a945c1db7d9a637606a7c18214850c2aa1b6c1d","781525e0950c282c855c14345c399b0e56c9157e","821325df89a0310e94a800acba0d970147cae589","2789e6bca46d57d3b9d284038e4e7e99e16c1932","4cc9777a857ab92f2e9c57f1917c0c42a15eb902","ec63d9f09ab60866d3c31974824f7575998b9d62","8855177783598a869a75f087657193148c52592d","cf19cfde407753a8da75de67506cf41d7f65da4f","0e471022646748372800be966c1758e84cbb43e1","57922e14892e58b60465c76388037942e445dd56"],"title":"A measurement error model for time-series studies of air pollution and mortality.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.2.157"}

For example, the effect size, or informally the benefit with treatment, is often greater in patients with a moderate condition of a disease than in those with a mild condition. A limitation of the usual method of analysis is that it does not incorporate this ordering of effect size by patient subgroup. We propose a test statistic which supplements the conventional test by including this information and simultaneously tests the null hypothesis in pre-specified subgroups and in the overall sample. It results in more power than the conventional test when the differences in effect sizes across subgroups are at least moderately large; otherwise it loses power. The method involves combining p-values from models fit to pre-specified subgroups and the overall sample in a manner that assigns greater weight to subgroups in which a larger effect size is expected. Results are presented for randomized trials with two and three subgroups.","inCitations":["4694301d3f5030c263ceb3f7c8ed44b43f661442","d0d6f17ef7fec826966266f234b8a87170c4cb46"],"title":"A single test for rejecting the null hypothesis in subgroups and in the overall sample.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1148718"}

Appropriate sample size planning is challenging in this situation, as in addition to the Type I error rate, power, and target difference the overall event rates and the correlation between the test statistics have to be defined. Reliable estimates of these quantities, however, are usually hard to obtain and therefore there is a high risk to not achieve the intended power in a fixed sample size design. In this article, we propose an internal pilot study design where the nuisance parameters are estimated in a blinded way at an interim stage and where the sample size is then revised accordingly. We investigate the characteristics of the proposed design with respect to the actual Type I error rate, power, and sample size. The application of this design is illustrated by a clinical trial example.","inCitations":["5077fcca092635eb309dc138bea73a836ec28ea9","d12f0e2066e207645fd78f9e732b271697342450","cac909e7e31fda693e7325b98e5e7b4e7baf7b6e"],"title":"Blinded sample size recalculation in clinical trials with binary composite endpoints.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1198371"}

This may cause serious problems for parameter estimation. A D-optimum design, which is very popular and effective for linear models, is not so good for nonlinear models with strong parameter curvature. In this article, we compare two optimality criteria applied to a nonlinear model. Both of them minimize the volume of the confidence ellipsoid of the parameters: D-optimality uses a linear approximation of the volume, and Q-optimality uses a quadratic approximation. We compute the relative design efficiencies and use a parameter-effect curvature measure to compute the number of observations that reduces the \"curvature effect\" to a specified level and improves the parameter estimation. The calculated designs differ significantly, and the Q-optimum design shows increasingly better statistical properties as the curvature increases. We present our results both graphically and as tables of numerical values.","inCitations":["4aff4fa4e3865828a428208f33cd2218dee9e20d","8ef878e0d02d24682e3d632a0e172f21282f7cf4","841b5b6aa58b0e025c9c923d3906f2cc6e1e312a","f32f83862445b46829b304a0f0c84f8f7dca7d76","cc2039929726cb3efc65f6e8a002f04d8802c5bf"],"title":"Comparison of two design optimality criteria applied to a nonlinear model.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200035458"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Computer Science","Medicine"],"year":2009,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Computational statistics","paperAbstract":"This chapter presents an overview of the development, capabilities, and utilization of geographic information systems (GIS). There are nearly an unlimited number of applications that are relevant to GIS because virtually all human interactions, natural and man-made features, resources, and populations have a geographic component. Everything happens somewhere and the location often has a role that affects what occurs. This role is often called spatial dependence or spatial autocorrelation, which exists when a phenomenon is not randomly geographically distributed. GIS has a number of key capabilities that are needed to conduct a spatial analysis to assess this spatial dependence. This chapter presents these capabilities (e.g., georeferencing, adjacency/distance measures, overlays) and provides a case study to illustrate how GIS can be used for both research and planning. Although GIS has developed into a relatively mature application for basic functions, development is needed to more seamlessly integrate spatial statistics and models.The issue of location, especially the geography of human activities, interactions between humanity and nature, and the distribution and location of natural resources and features, is one of the most basic elements of scientific inquiry. Conceptualizations and physical maps of geographic space have existed since the beginning of time because all human activity takes place in a geographic context. Representing objects in space, basically where things are located, is a critical aspect of the natural, social, and applied sciences. Throughout history there have been many methods of characterizing geographic space, especially maps created by artists, mariners, and others eventually leading to the development of the field of cartography. It is no surprise that the digital age has launched a major effort to utilize geographic data, but not just as maps. A geographic information system (GIS) facilitates the collection, analysis, and reporting of spatial data and related phenomena. The capabilities of GIS are much more than just mapping, although map production is one of the most utilized features. GIS applications are relevant in a tremendous number of areas ranging from basic geographic inventories to simulation models.This chapter presents a general overview of geographic information system topics. The purpose is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of a GIS, the types of data that are needed, the basic functionality of these systems, the role of spatial analysis, and an example in the form of a case study. The chapter is designed to provide advanced students and experts outside of the field of GIS sufficient information to begin to utilize GIS and spatial analytic concepts, but it is not designed to be the sole basis for becoming a GIS expert. There is a tremendous level of sophistication related to the digital cartographic databases and manipulation of those databases underlying the display and use of GIS that is more appropriately a part of geographic information science (i.e., basic research issues associated with geographic data including technical as well as theoretical aspects such as the impact on society [1]) rather than being relevant to this chapter. The utilization of GIS for conducting spatial analysis is the guiding theme for the chapter.","inCitations":["b1de0a0593a0140835478498387316f0531f2a2a","7402969a135d13864d205f40bf1b8f21b9359402","09d0ee77798f206284a3b7dd833fa75c8fd0d5e8","372c93d20c5c23bbcc7fa4c0237528dd22123452","e01ec27d79c7a8bab316accf28f5c1b8ad6b05ed","8fb10536124319b1d91e3e830d1630292962bba5","4d28c9ba147bad346adbad46ed661a4a1321e391","d2841771aac7addaa171e4285afb53c988035244","9eefd4084535a87e9c510cf969ef860e669734af","a83d77d7e13b23f2a1f38c2486f5665794fda299"],"title":"Geographic Information Systems.","doi":"10.1002/wics.21"}

[23] and [22] proposed outcome weighted learning to estimate individualized treatment rules directly through maximizing the expected outcome without modeling the response directly. In this paper, we extend the outcome weighted learning to right censored survival data without requiring either inverse probability of censoring weighting or semiparametric modeling of the censoring and failure times as done in [26]. To accomplish this, we take advantage of the tree based approach proposed in [28] to nonparametrically impute the survival time in two different ways. The first approach replaces the reward of each individual by the expected survival time, while in the second approach only the censored observations are imputed by their conditional expected failure times. We establish consistency and convergence rates for both estimators. In simulation studies, our estimators demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods. We also illustrate the proposed method on a phase III clinical trial of non-small cell lung cancer.","inCitations":["919e2ae2c4638976d55f996d29a9db1e8bf05079","faec6742a8d786f0e015c2ad0252231eb925c81b","b1d24cee2c6b8ffa853fb255d69bd07eecbebbb9","2b35cf0951c2d17d8ed8b805afbee9f89ee7caf5","b755ab41fa4476adcfac7ce3c475003ecf329f62","c1defeeb8dd3d0dcf2ab443de2f0f15e228f3a0f","b47d22d7ee02371b79ed269e18c5b4d0cb37a364"],"title":"Tree based weighted learning for estimating individualized treatment rules with censored data.","doi":"10.1214/17-EJS1305"}

However, this approach assumes the availability of patient-level data from a relatively large collection of similar trials, which may not be possible to achieve for a given disease application. One common solution to the problem of too few similar trials involves performing trial-level surrogacy analyses on trial sub-units (e.g., centers within trials), thereby artificially increasing the trial-level sample size for feasibility of the multi-trial analysis. To date, the practical impact of treating trial sub-units (centers) identically to trials in multi-trial surrogacy analyses remains unexplored, and conditions under which this ad hoc solution may in fact be reasonable have not been identified. We perform a simulation study to identify such conditions, and demonstrate practical implications using a multi-trial dataset of patients with early stage colon cancer.","inCitations":["69e37fc0be9082909d9a3b10c53b3d5f6b636df7","9469eb991860d1536ccd68f81ec91345b084fb3f","2941e5991e400ac3aaaafb71f473b8d495cb1d3d","bd6a282ca49a3b853db25cb20ed7b07b04dfb10b","b2cf4ef5b4fabc28ca4638fe3a0853e78b59a6cf","cd7a8d4d7c25fe9673a4381dcf37e4db6d2096b6","fbbcef70a665f11a69bdc98751d38c4c437656f0","4283b1b6d95ae4bdc8cc2681061390fa30b15222","f02b63182e50975185071a82a613dad8f18d77c1"],"title":"Center-within-trial versus trial-level evaluation of surrogate endpoints","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2014.03.011"}

This article considers a common setting with two sources of multiplicity induced by the analysis of multiple dose levels based on ordered endpoints. This results in multiplicity problems with multiple sequences of null hypotheses of no effect. Type I error rate inflation in problems of this type is typically addressed by using gatekeeping procedures that account for the hierarchical structure of the trial objectives. A general method for building gatekeeping procedures, known as the mixture method, tends to be conservative in problems with several sequences of hypotheses. This article defines a modified mixture method and shows that this method provides a power advantage over the standard mixture method. In addition, it is demonstrated that in special cases the modified mixture method allows for a stepwise testing algorithm, which facilities the implementation of gatekeeping procedures and general decision making. The new methodology is illustrated using two clinical trial examples.","inCitations":["920f3ea3416cac09ff6b70d01bac940a293d2846"],"title":"Mixture-based gatekeeping procedures for multiplicity problems with multiple sequences of hypotheses.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1074917"}

Short-term measurements of episodically consumed dietary components have zero-inflated skewed distributions. So-called two-part models have been developed for such data in order to correct for measurement error due to within-person variation and to estimate the distribution of usual intake of the dietary component in the univariate case. However, there is arguably much greater public health interest in the usual intake of an episodically consumed dietary component adjusted for energy (caloric) intake, e.g., ounces of whole grains per 1000 kilo-calories, which reflects usual dietary composition and adjusts for different total amounts of caloric intake. Because of this public health interest, it is important to have models to fit such data, and it is important that the model-fitting methods can be applied to all episodically consumed dietary components. We have recently developed a nonlinear mixed effects model (Kipnis, et al., 2010), and have fit it by maximum likelihood using nonlinear mixed effects programs and methodology (the SAS NLMIXED procedure). Maximum likelihood fitting of such a nonlinear mixed model is generally slow because of 3-dimensional adaptive Gaussian quadrature, and there are times when the programs either fail to converge or converge to models with a singular covariance matrix. For these reasons, we develop a Monte-Carlo (MCMC) computation of fitting this model, which allows for both frequentist and Bayesian inference. There are technical challenges to developing this solution because one of the covariance matrices in the model is patterned. Our main application is to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study, where we illustrate our methods for modeling the energy-adjusted usual intake of fish and whole grains. We demonstrate numerically that our methods lead to increased speed of computation, converge to reasonable solutions, and have the flexibility to be used in either a frequentist or a Bayesian manner.","inCitations":["58a327dd7da013b480e811052634f353167f3efd","7ccdbb12af7687e0070b7d787364af2989ad48e6","2ff2a5035839e1019fdcef6596fb56ef63e9f328","83008368643a01c52203138e32181a50379e3fb0","1cc9b97ba0c637564d040962ecea584988c1ad47","c35931403d3228c9c01108f234683149585193e5","970d3bb87a562c2602c9ea6e7f23c287747bca67","4ddb4caedb359080fd1efd581bd762e4aec55c3d","46411e2a4d879099580bdf792c442338ee4daaf1","e1c6f381601c241d624207aace9865d224886e69","9254f8fc9dbf9a165c92a03d8215e943936e713e","1cc48cc99f31bd268b70f5b8b616beece1f41a39","bcf7d3c52c512f441299cd9a24a8359db30f57b4","b56e031267d5041abe8512df43ec77860617ee24","d3cccfa6076db5d2a5407ea35cfb28b2dcea0cbe","02eec59a706cd1c70b38e6af9f9eed722eb2643d","21690aa2c0516ebed246f54ac418db588e4c4d80","31e6bec78cb52eaf3988965bc8da87d713329baa"],"title":"Fitting a Bivariate Measurement Error Model for Episodically Consumed Dietary Components","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1267"}
