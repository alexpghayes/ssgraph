Because tail areas of statistical distributions are needed for hypothesis testing, the accuracy of these areas is important to confidently make scientific judgments. Previous work on accuracy was primarily focused on evaluating professionally written statistical software, like SAS, on the Statistical Reference Datasets (StRD) provided by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and on the accuracy of tail areas in statistical distributions. The goal of this paper is to provide guidance to investigators, who are developing their own custom scientific software built upon numerical libraries written by others. In specific, we evaluate the accuracy of small tail areas from cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the Chi-square and t-distribution by comparing several open-source, free, or commercially licensed numerical libraries in Java, C, and R to widely accepted standards of comparison like ELV and DCDFLIB. In our evaluation, the C libraries and R functions are consistently accurate up to six significant digits. Amongst the evaluated Java libraries, Colt is most accurate. These languages and libraries are popular choices among programmers developing scientific software, so the results herein can be useful to programmers in choosing libraries for CDF accuracy.","inCitations":["5fbb0f50f7f33f5406c4f848c0319e1889648b9c","bca3a78cf71625f9e816636ff754aface9136c74","f60f83fff9ffd4ce0cda534c515ef09228655574","5d195e086639bb6952fee4731936235099365dd8","fb4de2a643a783b4c03038c94dbdd2b43daf007c"],"title":"How accurate are the extremely small P-values used in genomic research: An evaluation of numerical libraries","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.11.028"}

Typically, CCREM analyses omit the random interaction effect of the cross-classified factors. We investigate the impact of the omission of the interaction effect on parameter estimates and standard errors. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation study indicate that, for fixed effects, both coefficients estimates and accompanied standard error estimates are not biased. For random effects, results are affected at level 2 but not at level 1 by the presence of an interaction variance and/or a correlation between the residual of level two factors. Results from the analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study and the National Educational Longitudinal Study agree with those obtained from simulated data. We recommend that researchers attempt to include interaction effects of cross-classified factors in their models.","inCitations":["1e2d3577f5dbd21b02387d329c6eba0021cdada7","8cce9be09fcb391de6e0912dfc3dcd9f05750d68","e73a26c3bcbc82ad97b39db7bdc295718f81dfc3","a044175dd712126db4dc75920b5e3d957358c376","7b1de881a5937e5bf37e277c819a24d159183d70","b1f97f82424a966c0e674fa5c642159735210c59","bbaf0c53c986918487cfd5ceada941a7c595b1de","c79f78b59487cd54fd8b28debe9ed4009d877c1f","e58db2bbe957ba5b2987efcdd813cbd0eaba3fb5","a2e8e945f61c464e89fa39b339aa8454f4149abf","efa16cc30a228d89c362d06a13940f3a4eb1e2ec","f311d8b56b3be0f2666b8b14d823d1f88bc7e332","bcf54cb387b427a1bad2fd96d9e54b687275e372","f15b204ed197602f6acb8f2e275370fe1ad4c91b","138b9b6462a4362ff1e67dd6faeb9f1fb1352556","7029836c8460db92ccb4fb612875c344a6bfae10","12ba295414e176a8112e9342d5daf9a7f8ee15d9","258844ee4449e04603b0c94e6f004f6640e57967"],"title":"The impact of omitting the interaction between crossed factors in cross-classified random effects modelling.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X398968"}

In some clinical areas, efficacy endpoints may be highly correlated with safety endpoints, yet the interim efficacy analyses under group sequential designs usually do not consider safety measures formally in the analyses. Furthermore, safety is often statistically monitored more frequently than efficacy measures. Because early termination of a trial in this situation can be triggered by either efficacy or safety, the impact of safety monitoring on the error probabilities of efficacy analyses may be nontrivial if the original design does not take the multiplicity effect into account. We estimate the actual error probabilities for a bivariate binary efficacy-safety response in large confirmatory group sequential trials. The estimated probabilities are verified by Monte Carlo simulation. Our findings suggest that type I error for efficacy analyses decreases as efficacy-safety correlation or between-group difference in the safety event rate increases. In addition, although power for efficacy is robust to misspecification of the efficacy-safety correlation, it decreases dramatically as between-group difference in the safety event rate increases.","inCitations":["ba864a409e1b51327a833593e5723542a8ea830c"],"title":"Impact of safety monitoring on error probabilities of binary efficacy outcome analyses in large phase III group sequential trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1520"}

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new technology widely used today to screen the GCN changes in mutant cells with high resolution genome-wide. Statistical methods for analyzing such CGH data have been evolving. Existing methods are either frequentist's, or full Bayesian. The former often has computational advantage, while the latter can incorporate prior information into the model, but could be misleading when one does not have sound prior information. In an attempt to take full advantages of both approaches, we develop a Bayesian-frequentist hybrid approach, in which a subset of the model parameters is inferred by the Bayesian method, while the rest parameters by the frequentist's. This new hybrid approach provides advantages over those of the Bayesian or frequentist's method used alone. This is especially the case when sound prior information is available on part of the parameters, and the sample size is relatively small. Spatial dependence and false discovery rate are also discussed, and the parameter estimation is efficient. As an illustration, we used the proposed hybrid approach to analyze a real CGH data.","inCitations":["7fff2dfc60735a65e068693a929b04db39ec06cb"],"title":"Bayesian Frequentist hybrid Model wth Application to the Analysis of Gene Copy Number Changes.","doi":"10.1080/02664761003692449"}

The proposed methods were found to perform favorably compared with two existing methods in simulations, and were applied to prehypertension data from an RCT.","inCitations":["bcf54b4e4d07228350b7ee48129d396d42027bfe","f3b6e29c66a78dab03504b18bfdac810ca95632a","86e12a38ff7fdbc7617e9537db32248403ab150d","e8faa1943efa102db9da98667fb8782fa9c71908","38f6726e63864a704d0c177ddd1ddc638f6dc65f","ea566b87e415e3810395b490ab6705c353a7e9a5","f4290d39798b5b6e71ddd85a7af379bb6170c510","6d9faf269a628b0aaa6268bdbc67a7e6c44dbb69","e7bf4d0f240085bafabd72bf1258f0b131d6b48c"],"title":"Simple subgroup approximations to optimal treatment regimes from randomized clinical trial data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu049"}

We model the link-transformed mean response as the integral with respect to t of F{X(t), t} where F(·,·) is an unknown regression function and X(t) is a functional covariate. Rather than having an additive model in a finite number of principal components as in Müller and Yao (2008), our model incorporates the functional predictor directly and thus our model can be viewed as the natural functional extension of generalized additive models. We estimate F(·,·) using tensor-product B-splines with roughness penalties. A pointwise quantile transformation of the functional predictor is also considered to ensure each tensor-product B-spline has observed data on its support. The methods are evaluated using simulated data and their predictive performance is compared with other competing scalar-on-function regression alternatives. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach through an application to brain tractography, where X(t) is a signal from diffusion tensor imaging at position, t, along a tract in the brain. In one example, the response is disease-status (case or control) and in a second example, it is the score on a cognitive test. R code for performing the simulations and fitting the FGAM can be found in supplemental materials available online.","inCitations":["3444d75e8d869f5903b5ed91358790c2b2c26a9e","97588e50eb3198b53518c111ec70e23e5acd96c5","973e724aa43d68dfaf453df39b3a0453ab648fc8","c7b6d59439bef3b2b3e0b12d0eba1c3c602f9195","e185fc8379511f88df1d16aee2c2f3cd62167c92","8206d3b12030c12aebd82376c7eb5d8237c0485f","a80c76dc21f755b8c85dfadf967c56940b573956","62d7fe3b6d045bfa9cc117b890cb44fef5073bda","1f09bda8140b39cb505f8b0578e75bdf955ad284","77a7e028c624e68d7f8d83de0bb5222a9db27956","2f79f8c8b1766f5f2f2b28ad34678d9591a25f5d","15423f224f640625a00d3a900f1b2dc28f54ddfd","cfa408d7be06bd6f8b7dbe666319249b65a7e341","b35865588cc1b8351f30f19fffe7fafb82c63f40","9d505829ff214cba0409b7d296deffb45b4361a4","1f211db351ad7528d9aafc93767f30e8cc185571","f1562a78dce9336ab12be7d3bc0799d07cc038ff","ef4518e3080097d6977b5e817cd545547afbbf46","368b2d28d08dc158eb87d321be88632bfa1acb49","b1032f50b22f586e8151b9f53cfae3946522d36c","8bf620765e77c98424983de5d5b74b90d99e28fd","924308e7cf5c11aa1e5482e237d198fa131dccf1","9f9e71a9bb60ee1169d599df635ae874cec14f3e","36b18c76ff457c8a0cdb8149d6ba95c33544fc1d","dc1c7b1e83417c2ed442674d3d81e80c64c0d9d7","c8e681d21d88eb92a3d2d5d2491f6b023dca6844","6963eaa0363aa1304740d93108e1678ccd6c367c","833a43e2bebb8332a00cab43c363d571b44fb209","7eb06c0297704ee74d2d2df94ee4c94fa0d755d0","f6f74d14155e063dfd58314a17e0f77544befade","1417ca2b15d4e3b506e358236f0bd9e49862d9f0","b32f17a32b048591044a1589f4515a699983d0ca","166705a8a77f34b08f098ccf186c2f022d9cd7e7","9d2aa689305a0fb4230af70c7e05fdcb030aa182","6bc01ab828c27b42f6e2bed7c54f514cdf16ed3f","957e1b0aee3586f28d36543222a9b4ca97de6df8","6666473c926665eecc741a0dd29e1b329d273e38","d24ace1e4a06357091acd59706ff731a6c9c72fb","cd51b176215f16a89d130cfacba1390f9a893aeb","8e47a70d21d8b3cd59a50a6fb8d25483ba5bbe5a","a19eaef8596a241f85f156d561bedf1b038c1ed4","194221653d1ac4658e8ee7c9c422bace5e0d3af7","f2eb00a289d9eebbb17732760c0d4f04a3097076","3b9347e5806ed67e9ce67798315a8919f779ce8b","0904279ddce1fe60702b33203630a665f9724633","c4f9d0942ca4de8e444f1574b1d18c26841e88c4","1f72f4369155a6f4216eff909b8a17fa7ee676b9","80db689570574672afef672582e0ab3f7997c828","287806c883a167e23e7b3a1430b752a2d5dc5d88","4c62275567c654e7ef6d4922245fef38d74499da","fd6acb420909f2721ddc675e016c8920af3f9202","e84e8e24966143d52ae98b9afdac6ef2fa8aeaed","cf7c025b5ca3c0e936828d783667d4f862364b0e","3bc025a8c42f03607feb7eeea5276e33436b491c","4996a46b26c79bc3711bce2a136309e514a8c973","f70615e3a8f095896f92a358a1cd2325d1851706","95dbfe20605f8084913f5eb9c6a8668fd1b4f576","c89ad2e02f3b65a397b1ca1bf95480e6ab277f29","661a7934d0809aab4acec99f534263eee63226d4","459a53dcc4dad1d28c7313df349674f41ed2a0b3"],"title":"Functional Generalized Additive Models.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2012.729985"}

The program can also construct confidence bands for predicted cumulative incidence curves.We apply the methods to data on follicular cell lymphoma from Pintilie (2007), where the competing risks are disease relapse and death without relapse.

A key decision point on the development pathway has become the proof of concept study. These studies must provide clear information to the project teams to enable decision making about further developing a drug candidate but also to gain evidence that any effect size is sufficient to warrant this development given the current market environment. Our case study outlines one such proof of concept trial where a new candidate therapy for neuropathic pain was investigated to assess dose-response and to evaluate the magnitude of its effect compared to placebo. A Normal Dynamic Linear Model was used to estimate the dose-response--enforcing some smoothness in the dose-response, but allowing for the fact that the dose-response may be non-monotonic. A pragmatic, parallel group study design was used with interim analyses scheduled to allow the sponsor to drop ineffective doses or to stop the study. Simulations were performed to assess the operating characteristics of the study design. The study results are presented. Significant cost savings were made when it transpired that the new candidate drug did not show superior efficacy when compared placebo and the study was stopped.","inCitations":["ed35bdb3dc19abea13c0501ceeb2afdb083fb013","5f65b584b32be9a851b4582794318611a1313752","0a0cb1f882037a12fa5de2905b6b11867c620c04","bae8a43aa2ae8b0797b47fbdb0ce95ebd1118600","04821e92071da65f64e90474bd41f694f703583e","cde2b83be24cd49ceda974b6802ae850cb01f938","11889b45ba18e875ad40bba169ba3ac37e990422","9f93cfee2d31e9cd8de7069f79286aca3d486ba3","396feb1cdc2d6e9dd865f3f2c80921c7026a1e03","6fbbd94f127b6a316afa2e43442dce64b02f9448","7cbb4678f9782182f0cdfa53c0d40ae433d37493","f371e5954f92f843e0cee1ed414581ac494858fd","deb93e4238e187e441f1f752e00e18f628c9b3be","508514a9687c4f213ed1424677e5c35f02b3d8b6","185c0f7f79d631f0f7372a773bb64d07b6d1db31","7086c29b1f3d98f5836d1e3753e94569c918979a","fb717fab44c15934af848ed257c907ed9a1953fe","a818a9f424674f4ac32c997275ef10ec7a84dc31","88591cfc978c7116e82f677c5090f53560319e97","37d6bfe8a0d3428ce06af97858332398f8905121","bcded7eb099e8ef2026c4f487d015b71c432fdc7","335c882c43f7abee80ef86e76fc93880bdab3bc7","bd51a69388fdf6e796c274743a7407df481a5716","6c6ef0602114c0dcc42ad71acbe4d13e6a2b1fb2"],"title":"Implementation of a Bayesian adaptive design in a proof of concept study.","doi":"10.1002/pst.198"}

The model is estimated on sample of relatively poor households from the first three waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), for whom we would expect social security income to be of particular importance. The estimated model is used to simulate the responses to changes in social security rules, including changes in benefit levels, in the payroll tax, in the social security earnings tax and in early and normal retirement ages. Welfare and budget consequences are estimated.","inCitations":["7ec090aa5cc1e3a79c18f32540db3a976ec43011","ce5d8a139771cdfd0fb6cdd85801dc1bd6ccadf6","980a7b22075b023fcb464c2cfc16e48a37f1d1af","66a93f611e90a38421c5a4c41c904c8aec60bc2d","d030ce6da3c7e48cef2fda01b87d91a555005300","3e2f4529a2ded66d941365a7e09fb5bd5dfe6cf3","02ff82d1bc194b5f30e075a39c9254fab98396d0","8b545405a6310fba7b352e5cb6cc27472a946763","9773beebc30b089cef5623665dfce59335f738cf","744ed74a94e5209cd41ca45642714462d00fc2e4","1ad1160435c63e3eaab07fee9c92634899d1895c","29c813733fd45d6ffc6f9c7326e81aebb502b7eb","4861d40c33d71770f356a5a22de93759f24a003f","833eadb85f05e9eaba358264b920b35a2b0ad99d","9664edd692d2cb2b5085ed86664b6bf1adb96df8","b865df77d1bad11803869e010eefb14beac5c5ed","78b7325953390ec09313cc1793efb258a1ea287f","7ac930f84022675066fa4e5196d7c13cffc3d722","a1c9beb41beff923fe461d3518c27930d1799c32","0fd147169774abcb769db24835cff8934a04b410","66597cd04e8eb0971441d73621ac6146e177a19b","7f912fb0425f67fb3b134ed0a31affebcdf8ee2c","49c7a856e9d87b4168eda3cc91dc99f198baf66c","500571a7081705bc67e3fc328d24e7d4aa5c5a96","901b6cb60dd6c9548a9dc3971e01e88ec4deba6d","c355312c335d63f8cc0ff4215428a14753308239","1578bcfa1a16ba2283026b7ccc730dca2f237d8c","815b8114c6bb6a503151a9cb7e3728dae608e0d5","8b432efbeb78180c513dc0dabcce8d92dedba085","6aec3f77050c6f9aa72c1cc556b7d9a0aa3374e1","75385a56d742acf505962b15cfb81e523583b16d","37d62de76d2313e2a7d47905b410570309dc9f5a","800aff557ab11fdd867e72953c70b6c6d883f709","2e4c5d3dda9fae79d53a160e13dfb0c3d796073f","16382cffb2ee127914dc0f127d868028e1da47e0","8c3e6d5ffffe02ae9ac602799e92ca6a831b918d","67c8db158789cd494ce91dd3fa0b0a2c23c8f0af","52cd343672fb5c80bfe4c5ef6dfbe6d4c07babd7","052e019dd845a53199cd898fe5fc7665923d8975","0ed75f8ebfb714706eacd134c3bf7ced38d912e6","97c62d44e5fa7dfddd9cc5e9e7cf8faf0323067f","5e8ede2c425a462aa02ee2e63f753aeffc3ec5c2","ced4fac453d0a300aa73ea813cceabb4758bc144","6cc47c82a38c0befc04b94d12dd0b71dd7b89642","47fd2afeb4f6d725e8af2bd80142bec76b5c517d","c7b1a29d4efcf5d061516e3088b01e03286eafff","b251635d42cc052d28bbe6f059f919147ebb7449","9e41989fcef93a37e52f78eb7b943d9bd0437d1e","3cb1fb9152a8493efb920f934e23fba99052fb2c","b1921f6af9029b1b1071cf4030623663c79a0516","aca5e73fa83c0b5e94146cf4dbdde0097b2d40d7","877c710aa4d5a38ba6d2b365c7f3a22a67153095","e4dc9d8a0fb67ef80cde2983fda403a3af5903c3","6fb5798846c6fe9af13827c722c1053f0d343e73","4e0d03a5d1d59acfd9650749399a97e5bc9dd441","5d1fa0c5d5c9991e5b9c2c1f4ff24b97c3dab60a","cc373a4d11251c0b2fed2e4f4d1ea8935ad0b124","a62b4eeab903957cd3edbb76dea4c50b0b6082c7","5ad2e4765d76e4c9268582e70084a02247f0c70d","109f19c3d8688ff521f77892e30677b444504ff6","7205753d1fff660b06ba9a828dab6081aa283c33","9227af1ecd6c2bf2e7c9f1314ceaf5876b5858f0","1fbc48b065b197628d87dd4036b9012db81c0156","8a5ee4e51f94fa09c43929f9993ff4eebc4c8b24","5d5f5cf57d1e71736a5befc520735d541cb926f9","57de411c0859ffd6c785aab9df32afb5c7ecaf0a","738b69d0f2b5b223b0ad48d82ddbf30d66ee057f","acb662b7fa7fe8c1d9f9a1e683ea4135fd61613e","dc7689893644f6c3c69ca803810908a198ee519a","64808d47702aea0e1e4fa760f4c32375275b16d4","06f1eae07a0abf02fc8ac495b06f5ffcb61b8a7b","1ddb5810329d87e0f6b5bcfa61e9a6e8f9c8ea81","01433833a712e91122e05744b4b163c610a91b95","55c098f10e04234ff9a4afb485da4bcb30319320","9e4b843405065e3b23462a1276f5b55d1140db8d","815b49bda23f7d63a959bca57456427acadee0c0","47518cae75181d7527813af6cf7830715a677dce","405ae6428e82d3d636d7fe566f87c37055b48beb","9834b33f256c4c187a48c233e618a83b7a045f29","eb7ab663a91e8047b9f70612ee0c2410c93a90ff","c355dee41039026ca58a7ba0209d7b2ff2cf759c","7d45fad92cbc72a0d2235aed69f6b58aefda64f1","5c9199437d495194727e06dd08663bec1c24a04b","3706156e40037918ac0a1c498f195d490d4370bd","207eb84daabac252802c08d1b4f4c190e1b3129b","bfd17a7d61add4a05fb62ffe6d12a4a617cc3e0d","f762e017e194c617f915c146545d01020ecc25ef","d8b8c6bf1a71f9bae998cd0600114543fee95a86","0a7b5e7887da4d1382669f1ec63b51b846d2edfd","ebc937f2627c5f106bcbe5dfdf0bb83406c71dba","af9c968f96c7ffb80cd43cc87993a3c0c6d48630","536f407e155be93b9a88d5f478b432c7fc6408bf","532ccd1d93319c4ad797e89ca12c663c4ab80f33","810de5b65d8fe19a93dccd7cbbf11281713b29ec","4c342e1af87e2f6a89bba8d1479a205a05530074","912bd12a3fbdbf7cf8f838aa2c674dabfbe0fea8","4077cde630572db87ed7fe6ff1fe72ce810926a7","cae416771f6a75f9d0139aff74c3af81397710df","c4db3bf6d83fdca975256ebe936255c0198d3a5d","b8c0e10e31abeff3032fa6f876933cd3c83cd3ac","4224b088b9bd2fb6dee8aa911495c7b006d80b93","297b2aee554c352e41bdeeaf3dc9b19b28efa522","fc52965608f51aa7448cb5b5aaf1039b41b7ec6d","003884b3e980c4ea4fb2ca6990a3007731133c8a","a4cf4685f47c73ac110d9d7995678bb6f5da5812","5a59a9d674f7d40f77f79d57f979d85490938a61","33ee92b0a7a1592db025b3c2e8e1ea9b68786228","ab552eb321c362ab1108b1723904dba377aa3a5e","9834686e3d4dfbf238397b934cba290135862a55","f30b409e3ba1e87a9b37369a9e3ef4579a839518","a5aa5857962eec47c798b22f447a4b7a20c3cbf4","05316bfccaa3629f07c167c64ae3dfb92c1603da","84b9cc30a364b5ca1239d58d8661d477001adfaa","e1386c68aab62bc04bca116e017d5add3bc94c8a","bdfdcc0855d318c10ad885729931a8586199d747","9570ddf7988e54bcdc03bdcc4f3

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"We consider joint spatial modelling of areal multivariate categorical data assuming a multiway contingency table for the variables, modelled by using a log-linear model, and connected across units by using spatial random effects. With no distinction regarding whether variables are response or explanatory, we do not limit inference to conditional probabilities, as in customary spatial logistic regression. With joint probabilities we can calculate arbitrary marginal and conditional probabilities without having to refit models to investigate different hypotheses. Flexible aggregation allows us to investigate subgroups of interest; flexible conditioning enables not only the study of outcomes given risk factors but also retrospective study of risk factors given outcomes. A benefit of joint spatial modelling is the opportunity to reveal disparities in health in a richer fashion, e.g. across space for any particular group of cells, across groups of cells at a particular location, and, hence, potential space-group interaction. We illustrate with an analysis of birth records for the state of North Carolina and compare with spatial logistic regression.","inCitations":["933593338a295b76f8b51467d16037460063856e","2762285b52eddd52917d3c0b015a94e097f7e267","4b2aede597a6c46eb239e19b5c4fae79c49e57d7","5c61ad360b3bdc29d8c9574ab2094c28a00f8b0a","c03dd7d28068f22a88de20fcde3d5bcee8d93873"],"title":"Disaggregated spatial modelling for areal unit categorical data.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2009.00682.x"}

A major complication arises when recurrent events are terminated by death. To assess the overall effects of covariates on the two types of events, we define a weighted composite endpoint as the cumulative number of recurrent and terminal events properly weighted by the relative severity of each event. We propose a semiparametric proportional rates model which specifies that the (possibly time-varying) covariates have multiplicative effects on the rate function of the weighted composite endpoint while leaving the form of the rate function and the dependence among recurrent and terminal events completely unspecified. We construct appropriate estimators for the regression parameters and the cumulative frequency function. We show that the estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal with variances that can be consistently estimated. We also develop graphical and numerical procedures for checking the adequacy of the model. We then demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods in simulation studies. Finally, we provide an application to a major cardiovascular clinical trial.","inCitations":["8c2430e1a738191f54d4a417edab00a1e884c586","090e6c9926263ba0563f37609187801e257fc229","f2750818950009bab29b0530000f2b82ee587b77","266c24d381f7c15b0b595d6b33daa13a7e63fda7"],"title":"Semiparametric regression for the weighted composite endpoint of recurrent and terminal events.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv050"}

These may range from supplementary material to the complete data set—and may be made available only on request, accessible online with a password, or openly accessible to all on the web with a link on bmj.com —perhaps after a clearly stated period of personal use (Groves, 2009). The response has been slow, with only a handful so far providing greater access to the data underpinning BMJ papers. For instance, the meta-analysis of Law and others (2009) of 147 randomized trials of antihypertensive drugs to prevent cardiovascular disease ends with this statement: “Data sharing: An audit trail of the forest plots and related data is available at www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/bptrial,” and for the case control study of Garcia-Garcia and others (2009) on partial protection with seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccine against influenza A/H1N1 in Mexico City, the statement says “Data sharing: The technical appendix, statistical code, and dataset are available from jvaldespinog@birmex.gob.mx.” It is a start, and even having the negative statement “no additional data available” at the end of a paper sends a clear signal that the journal wants authors to consider and embrace the concept. We will continue to debate and campaign on this. The BMJ is emulating Annals of Internal Medicine reproducible research statements (Laine and others, 2007) in turn inspired by the policy of American Journal of Epidemiology (Peng and others, 2006). But we are not interested in data sharing only as a means to evaluate scientific claims or guard against misconduct (including failure to disclose financial interests; Allison, 2009). Data sharing after publication of the top line results is a natural and important extension of the BMJ’s philosophy of open access and transparency (scientific, ethical, and financial) in reporting medical research, and we believe that it has great potential to increase the understanding and use of information that is largely funded with public money. There are challenges, of course. Sharing raises important questions about data ownership (Delamothe, 1996) and permission for data release; technical issues of data storage, management, compatibility, archiving, access, and mining; and concerns about who should have access and when, and what limits may be needed to prevent misuse and mishandling of data—a caveat that Keiding (2010) rightly points out in this issue. Moreover, researchers lack incentives to analyze all the data that they generate, to manage data after funded projects have ended, and to share data other than informally with certain collaborators. And for medical researchers, sharing of clinical research data is a particularly tricky concept because the combination of clinical and personal data and the geographical location of a study can be enough to reveal a research participant’s identity. Hence, clinical research data need to be anonymized carefully before sharing and, in future, patients should be asked up front for consent to data sharing as well as consent to take part in the research (Hrynaszkiewicz and Altman, 2009).","inCitations":["59e8e8a0dbedcf231642d3a40ab5ae45fe6ac357","b874a55c99e41c8c8be280d6db24487780544d65","a30de4d203da15156d565a63e6437501af9285ab","b2cef5919edf73359cfa61149e4f5796535a1e1e","25ae23330b67472b5ca56a9fdb754524e50a6c6c","a7757cc619b1262fdbead3fe97b99d79a19ba5c3"],"title":"The wider concept of data sharing: view from the BMJ.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq031"}
