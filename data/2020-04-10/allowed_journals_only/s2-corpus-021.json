The proposed estimators for the regression coefficients include a class of minimum distance estimators defined through weighted empirical odds function. We have investigated the asymptotic properties like the consistency and the limiting distribution of the proposed estimators under mild conditions. The finite sample properties were investigated through simulation study making comparison of some of the estimators in the class. We conclude with an illustration of our proposed method to a well-known AIDS data.","inCitations":["d391876cf44e9e269fa55b788b8008b44de2ed54","199c6e180da4eab34affd91eceae4b6718ad57eb"],"title":"Semiparametric inference of proportional odds model based on randomly truncated data.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2008.08.006"}

For batch acceptance by this or other quantitative tests of batch quality, one approach uses two-sided tolerance intervals of specified content. If the tolerance interval falls entirely within an acceptance interval, the batch is accepted. This has the form of a statistical hypothesis test. Once we recognize this approach as a statistical test, we can ask what sample size is required to be able to accept the batch with a desired power. The power for a single-stage design is a bivariate noncentral t probability and can be determined using previously published algorithms. Using standard methods for interim analyses, the approach is extended to multistage designs. Power and sample size for multistage designs are validated with simulations. We demonstrate it is possible to design one- and two-stage designs for batch acceptance with desired power and specified type I level.","inCitations":["6d995b83fb83b69bb2b134d80d1d7b3f8828c373","5230d28225fee6cb944da976b93f7e26b4f8ceb5","db526c066feec8e4f1c0fb3a5fa8c6db214f4e1f","94f7e0f6cb43c76e69f5ee29bd7d92ec9d50588d","223c50bdd9c393b76d83c1a7db24b737109eb9eb"],"title":"Sample sizes for batch acceptance from single- and multistage designs using two-sided normal tolerance intervals with specified content.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120008852"}

We develop a method called Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) in which a state space model for the parameters of each model is combined with a Markov chain model for the correct model. This allows the \"correct\" model to vary over time. The state space and Markov chain models are both specified in terms of forgetting, leading to a highly parsimonious representation. As a special case, when the model and parameters do not change, DMA is a recursive implementation of standard Bayesian model averaging, which we call recursive model averaging. The method is applied to the problem of predicting the output strip thickness for a cold rolling mill, where the output is measured with a time delay. We found that when only a small number of physically motivated models were considered and one was clearly best, the method quickly converged to the best model, and the cost of model uncertainty was small; indeed DMA performed slightly better than the best physical model. When model uncertainty and the number of models considered were large, our method ensured that the penalty for model uncertainty was small. At the beginning of the process, when control is most difficult, we found that DMA over a large model space led to better predictions than the single best performing physically motivated model.

To effectively fulfill their responsibilities, DMCs should be independent of study sponsors, study investigators, and caregivers managing study participants. Unfortunately, in real-world settings where DMCs are in place, there are some practices that threaten to diminish the level of independence of these committees. To address this, some important approaches should be considered: A DMC charter should outline the roles and responsibilities of the DMC without appearing to be a legal contract; the meetings of the DMC should be led by its chair, ideally with a meeting format that ensures independence from the investigators and sponsor; the DMC and those having leadership roles in the monitoring process should have adequate training and experience; procedures should be in place to enable the DMC to have access to interim safety and efficacy data that are accurate, current, and comprehensive; these data should be presented to the DMC unblinded by treatment group, while being kept confidential from all others; DMC recommendations should be developed through consensus development rather than by casting votes; creative approaches are needed for the engagement of DMC members to increase the transparency such that they are neither employees of nor consultants to the sponsor of the trial; meaningful conflicts of interest should be identified and addressed; and finally, members of DMCs should have adequate indemnification that provides effective protection.","inCitations":["cc3169e91b760e63ae0352c5564289f7df05b15f","acd2fda3da333113b35468bd6192e8db70f59d66","3351821fceb8d140d8b94b62b2dd7a46f071ee42","2a7c49bfb08441098abdcca76e2cd10e869971b9","d2dcf91f4d16e0330171768b450be28058fe1fee","d5853cf510a20bb39a9dfe0f345c2467506a17a9","cc5494d44dcd5413e34a2a23d99eb6cc6f9a1ffa","3ee8460a5888ee290a08ea7d0487897a6fece760","3afdc1783135635ef978119e80c434f12fad6f20"],"title":"Enhancing trial integrity by protecting the independence of data monitoring committees in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.925719"}

Ng (2003), however, argues that even though there is no inflation of the Type I error rate, this type of simultaneous testing is problematic because it may lead to loss of power in the subsequent confirmatory trial. And he recommends to conduct only one test chosen on the basis of the sponsor's preliminary assessment. We view the question of whether one should simultaneously test for noninferiority and superiority from a decision-theoretic view point. We develop the loss function approach implicit in Ng's research and compare his recommendation to simultaneous testing procedures indexed by a variety of design parameters. We find that the simultaneous testing procedure generally provides smaller loss than Ng's method, except when the prior distribution allocates a large probability to equivalence of the two treatments.","inCitations":["f446cae02cd04319bafac3411f213c11d8977721","5c111be6b6cc41f0be67c588070fd8dffba5b6bf"],"title":"Decision-theoretic views on simultaneous testing of superiority and noninferiority.","doi":"10.1080/10543400500265694"}

This index of fit, which is insensitive to sample size, is applied to the problem of assessing the fit of the Rasch model. In this application, use is made of the equivalence of the semi-parametric version of the Rasch model to specifically restricted latent class models. Therefore, the Rasch model can be represented by the structured component of the RCL mixture, with this component itself consisting of two or more subcomponents corresponding to the classes, and the unstructured component capturing the discrepancies between the data and the model. An empirical example demonstrates the application of this approach. Based on four-item data, the one- and two-class unrestricted latent class models and the one- to three-class models restricted according to the Rasch model are considered, with respect to both their chi-squared statistics and their mixture fit indices.","inCitations":["305d502c97904e4df4a8282aec0305d453fe3a1c","a8d36d7688a143557c4b31adef473bcde8ddd27a","53e1414eada924a2fb33c0ceddc0a919f6928243"],"title":"Testing the Rasch model by means of the mixture fit index.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X72818"}

This work represents a significant improvement over existing approaches to system identification using nonlinear hemodynamic models. It is important for three reasons. First, instead of using linearized approximations of the dynamics, we present a nonlinear filtering based on the sequential Monte Carlo method to capture the inherent nonlinearities in the physiological system. Second, we simultaneously estimate the hidden physiological states and the system parameters through particle filtering with sequential parameter learning to fully take advantage of the dynamic information of the BOLD signals. Third, during the unknown static parameter learning, we employ the low-dimensional sufficient statistics for efficiency and avoiding potential degeneration of the parameters. The performance of the proposed method is validated using both the simulated data and real BOLD fMRI data.","inCitations":["559fa55e5b32409ae7d77b65ccaefb0a14811e9a","58b2ba5af44e737889c5f3d5e62b10068a4c7458","288521cb198848d92be9c969e70edbcc10cb2cce"],"title":"PARTICLE FILTERING WITH SEQUENTIAL PARAMETER LEARNING FOR NONLINEAR BOLD fMRI SIGNALS.","doi":""}

Circular data are data measured in the form of angles or two-dimensional orientations. As an example, experiments investigating the development of spatial memory and the influence of visual experience on haptic orientation perception are presented. Three permutation tests are proposed for the evaluation of ordered hypotheses. The quality of the permutation tests is investigated by means of several simulation studies. The results of these studies show the expected increase in power when the permutation tests for ordered hypotheses are compared to a common non-directional test for circular data. The differences in power between the three tests for ordered alternatives are small.","inCitations":["322033e8d802404c2a90e0626a59bf02cb5c119c","104bf6e878d98914a45b9f7fcfec5a868389399a","6ec6d52cac023decbc1e3c600f71b12cbc7c1b76"],"title":"Evaluating order-constrained hypotheses for circular data using permutation tests.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02018.x"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"year":2016,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"For aggregation tests of genes or regions, the set of included variants often have small total minor allele counts (MACs), and this is particularly true when the most deleterious sets of variants are considered. When MAC is low, commonly used asymptotic tests are not well calibrated for binary phenotypes and can have conservative or anti-conservative results and potential power loss. Empirical p-values obtained via resampling methods are computationally costly for highly significant p-values and the results can be conservative due to the discrete nature of resampling tests. Based on the observation that only the individuals containing minor alleles contribute to the score statistics, we develop an efficient resampling method for single and multiple variant score-based tests that can adjust for covariates. Our method can improve computational efficiency >1000-fold over conventional resampling for low MAC variant sets. We ameliorate the conservativeness of results through the use of mid-p-values. Using the estimated minimum achievable p-value for each test, we calibrate QQ plots and provide an effective number of tests. In analysis of a case-control study with deep exome sequence, we demonstrate that our methods are both well calibrated and also reduce computation time significantly compared with resampling methods.","inCitations":["abcfc9747b760734fc02a9bac90ba0384ca6d31c","4ddf109697ca84c9d49c2b58311dbe0830aa7026","01f213770ba3f5c595a4330d02b330ee67c0560b","b2c76428548e435fdf0ad91e1e223c69424c6a0b","3e024b1433e341933540e4f9cd34ad8fcbe1a320","414b4ed17fc0d8023bc7f97b043ea2b44bf5b54b","eba925b262938135630b7748a31b4f62404f3819","8a4ca4c6ec9843f6aabaa7cc73f840d6f15e896f","35c651a217b9507e83db4a8a99fd42345bddb49c","ff3f1ff6bac2274732b31659cf7727de54845585","53fa2d4535989302a8f1509359e1d54c98cdc8fb","029830f14f3827141989d9a2747049e451534aab"],"title":"An efficient resampling method for calibrating single and gene-based rare variant association analysis in case-control studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv033"}

Williams-type contrasts and Dunnett-type comparisons to control are special cases of this approach. In simulation studies, the acceptable performance for finite sample sizes is demonstrated.

So far, these two estimation procedures were presented and studied under the gamma frailty distribution mainly because of its simple interpretation and mathematical tractability. Modifications of both procedures for other frailty distributions, such as inverse Gaussian, positive stable and a specific case of discrete distribution, are presented. By extensive simulations, it is shown that under the family specific proportional hazards model, the gamma frailty model appears to be robust to frailty distribution misspecification in both bias and efficiency loss in the marginal parameters. The population-averaged proportional hazards model, is found to be robust under the gamma frailty model misspecification only under moderate or weak dependency within cluster members.","inCitations":["119d65ac264e64835fd9f602d9f23041b8c8132e","19592270feeed640b89b6f50d08fc766ca5d466f"],"title":"Conditional and Marginal Estimates in Case-Control Family Data - Extensions and Sensitivity Analyses.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2011.581669"}

This is in part because inference for a stochastic transmission model can be difficult since the likelihood is often intractable due to partial observability. In this work, we address the question of adequate inclusion of variability by demonstrating a systematic approach for model selection and parameter inference for dynamic epidemic models. For this, we perform inference for six partially observed Markov process models, which assume the same underlying transmission dynamics, but differ with respect to the amount of variability they allow for. The inference framework for the stochastic transmission models is provided by iterated filtering methods, which are readily implemented in the R package pomp by King and others (2016, Statistical inference for partially observed Markov processes via the R package pomp. Journal of Statistical Software69, 1-43). We illustrate our approach on German rotavirus surveillance data from 2001 to 2008, discuss practical difficulties of the methods used and calculate a model based estimate for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ using these data.","inCitations":["696e6c582cf0688fd0b899404de46d3c1544206e","304a515db50dea49cc8127b885ba8f7ecba38861","5c55c334162b13e7b573f288d790a9488ee9f76d","fa4c0136b5f96f629bab51b569a3eb4f24b0db0f","9acc731550520053c8f8dc9248dd587ea6397114","cfa032c8c5706ee81a2d3d6cd1cd0e2aa7da2f47","113ae31fc04a45fbf00f63a5c036052406ccd642"],"title":"Model selection and parameter estimation for dynamic epidemic models via iterated filtering: application to rotavirus in Germany.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy057"}

The currently commonly used testing methods, e.g. log-rank test, Wilcoxon test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, may have a significant loss of statistical testing power under certain circumstances. In this paper we propose a new testing method that is robust for the comparison of the overall homogeneity of survival curves based on the absolute difference of the area under the survival curves using normal approximation by Greenwood's formula. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the performance of the new testing method compared against the log-rank, Wilcoxon, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests under a variety of circumstances. The proposed new method has robust performance with greater power to detect the overall differences than the log-rank, Wilcoxon, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests in many scenarios in the simulations.

Conducting separate trials within subgroups may lead to infeasibly small sample sizes in subgroups having low prevalence. Alternatively,it is not obvious how to conduct a single trial while accounting for heterogeneity. To address this problem,we consider a generalization of the continual reassessment method on the basis of a hierarchical Bayesian dose-toxicity model that borrows strength between subgroups under the assumption that the subgroups are exchangeable. We evaluate a design using this model that includes subgroup-specific dose selection and safety rules. A simulation study is presented that includes comparison of this method to 3 alternative approaches,on the basis of nonhierarchical models,that make different types of assumptions about within-subgroup dose-toxicity curves. The simulations show that the hierarchical model-based method is recommended in settings where the dose-toxicity curves are exchangeable between subgroups. We present practical guidelines for application and provide computer programs for trial simulation and conduct.","inCitations":["48e323ecbab1731184b49758e44ea3302b6a5cd7","0bd7e12515b4f2914207e3f8771c4e7d466a4af2","9aea7d0d68b51c97f951dd5125044e2c58c6d13c"],"title":"A simulation study of methods for selecting subgroup-specific doses in phase 1 trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1797"}

Using Dunnett's test, the Type I error level for the comparison between the raw mean of the control and the raw means of the study drug groups can be exactly calculated for the normal data. However, this computability depends on the independence of the raw means. Unfortunately, this independence does not exist for the model-based likelihood estimates (least square means) in the cases of ANCOVA and two-way ANOVA models without interaction for unbalanced data. This paper investigates this dependence between the least square means and derives some new procedures to calculate the joint distribution of the statistic for Dunnett's test.","inCitations":["ef308ee8469fe0474820db8eae6bee467a84f48e","faa0b22074006176d0da31eefb61797715241f89","f1aa84526dfbc7c3d4a5f8f687fa08d57a02f251","f02095cfea7701032db9cb7b1eea3eaaa12bce35","8df31f9e10b1e6866f941f2e23a1c4be74a961e7"],"title":"Dunnett's many-to-one test and least square means.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120017723"}

The methodology for grouped survival data is based on life tables, where the times are grouped in k intervals, and we fit discrete lifetime regression models to the data. The model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood and jackknife methods. To detect influential observations in the proposed model, diagnostic measures based on case deletion, so-called global influence, and influence measures based on small perturbations in the data or in the model, referred to as local influence, are used. In addition to these measures, the total local influence and influential estimates are also used. We conduct Monte Carlo simulation studies to assess the finite sample behavior of the maximum likelihood estimators of the proposed model for grouped survival. A real data set is analyzed using a regression model for grouped data.","inCitations":["5967e6ff3126257f1223779e05da5b1e3a61ede9","c704b3aeb159b29cc311eec38d57e54acbb77fc8"],"title":"The log-Burr XII regression model for grouped survival data.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.509527"}
