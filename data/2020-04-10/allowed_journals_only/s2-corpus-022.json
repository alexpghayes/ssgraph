Functional data analysis, which treats smoothed curves instead of originally observed discrete data, is effective for the time course expression profiles in terms of dimension reduction, robustness, and applicability to data measured at small and irregularly spaced time points. However, the statistical method of differential analysis for time course expression profiles has not been well established. We propose a functional logistic model based on elastic net regularization (F-Logistic) in order to identify the genes with dynamic alterations in case/control study. We employ a mixed model as a smoothing method to obtain functional data; then F-Logistic is applied to time course profiles measured at small and irregularly spaced time points. We evaluate the performance of F-Logistic in comparison with another functional data approach, i.e. functional ANOVA test (F-ANOVA), by applying the methods to real and synthetic time course data sets. The real data sets consist of the time course gene expression profiles for long-term effects of recombinant interferon β on disease progression in multiple sclerosis. F-Logistic distinguishes dynamic alterations, which cannot be found by competitive approaches such as F-ANOVA, in case/control study based on time course expression profiles. F-Logistic is effective for time-dependent biomarker detection, diagnosis, and therapy.","inCitations":["89d60a67a005920b0655bceb76a0e2127cf2ab9d","e0355c7e966d9769ebe555e752a4f44a5d60d794","94128e75477d1b188dbcc780fe1a16054f84d10e","a6615778b628a548748770c11bb827a688e9d903","a3adbe7ca62078f7bb63d0531a8f7696c64a2c8f","2ec864d74d8c941f1c48b21e25ec72a345e200bc","260fcde699e1611f6fb19190098d904df1b2fb83","8be203e0e3f917638ce737dde9347d85e685d20f"],"title":"Gene set differential analysis of time course expression profiles via sparse estimation in functional logistic model with application to time-dependent biomarker detection.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv037"}

The paper also illustrates the use of nonlinear programming as a means for finding sample allocations that are subject to a variety of practical constraints. A commercial address list and data from the National Survey of Family Growth and the Health and Retirement Study are used to illustrate the calculation of allocations to strata of housing units defined by information on the list.","inCitations":["17a995798f2364b0d356770798df5190ffeab442","5027bc08009e07d3f20b70292ca926a5f062f1da","c4ce78e86efab2876fb335f24d18d522ff14e356","2b51fa66103a757afd04f12ad6062641802777a8","c270dcd92fb5d106332b492a4e393948df3731ca"],"title":"Efficient Use of Commercial Lists in U.S. Household Sampling.","doi":"10.1093/jssam/smu006"}

The goal of these studies is to show that there is an acceptable level of agreement between the measurement systems. Equivalence testing is a reasonable approach in assay validation. In this article, we use an equivalence-testing criterion based on a decomposition of a concordance correlation coefficient proposed by Lin (1989, 1992). Using a variance components approach, we develop bounds for conducting statistical tests using the proposed equivalence criterion. We conduct a simulation study to assess the performance of the bounds. The criteria are the ability to maintain the stated test size and the simulated power of the tests using these bounds. Bounds that perform well for small sample size are preferred. We present a computational example to demonstrate the methods described in the article.","inCitations":["378e3e71bc3f2c6cc5af891c91d2f8d65086f363","ddfc9e436a219112a832f7ed9183ce4cf72dfc9c","6e5c130842746de9287e551d2fb03d0d8bd69a50","313dd66aad0d3b6bd433729d84eab03ea031ea50"],"title":"Assessment of equivalence using a concordance correlation coefficient in a repeated measurements design.","doi":"10.1080/10543400500265652"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2012,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Communications in statistics: theory and methods","paperAbstract":"The key feature of a mixed model is the presence of random effects. We have developed a coefficient, called the random effects coefficient of determination, [Formula: see text], that estimates the proportion of the conditional variance of the dependent variable explained by random effects. This coefficient takes values from 0 to 1 and indicates how strong the random effects are. The difference from the earlier suggested fixed effects coefficient of determination is emphasized. If [Formula: see text] is close to 0, there is weak support for random effects in the model because the reduction of the variance of the dependent variable due to random effects is small; consequently, random effects may be ignored and the model simplifies to standard linear regression. The value of [Formula: see text] apart from 0 indicates the evidence of the variance reduction in support of the mixed model. If random effects coefficient of determination is close to 1 the variance of random effects is very large and random effects turn into free fixed effects-the model can be estimated using the dummy variable approach. We derive explicit formulas for [Formula: see text] in three special cases: the random intercept model, the growth curve model, and meta-analysis model. Theoretical results are illustrated with three mixed model examples: (1) travel time to the nearest cancer center for women with breast cancer in the U.S., (2) cumulative time watching alcohol related scenes in movies among young U.S. teens, as a risk factor for early drinking onset, and (3) the classic example of the meta-analysis model for combination of 13 studies on tuberculosis vaccine.","inCitations":["d064f36b6850e45bb062189febe8db2dc3c0cdf2","738f17c468875e4a2acaffa6f2d28688f7ab7c90","10f427ecf88f4086d67ceb409d1e4b5007e9c882","e45956c2a59d1eb83d3e11aae40c420a56d69564","2197f9276cc4d4bc401a365e14a9710820ace630","7117a15585b1dd7893104d1ad624d9cbc1d0d314","fa78b6fff28f1609fc759300ce7e8fe044992aa8","b7a7a040f06e34d2a3b9bf42431fc070965221cd","c80c9370a0e0081ec1f6e2285166fac448d72c29"],"title":"Random effects coefficient of determination for mixed and meta-analysis models.","doi":"10.1080/03610926.2010.535631"}

To be useful and credible, it is generally agreed that modelling and simulation should be undertaken according to some kind of best practice. A number of authors have suggested elements required for best practice in modelling and simulation. Elements that have been suggested include the pre-specification of goals, assumptions, methods, and outputs. However, a project that involves modelling and simulation could be simple or complex and could be of relatively low or high importance to the project. It has been argued that the level of detail and the strictness of pre-specification should be allowed to vary, depending on the complexity and importance of the project. This best practice document does not prescribe how to develop a statistical model. Rather, it describes the elements required for the specification of a project and requires that the practitioner justify in the specification the omission of any of the elements and, in addition, justify the level of detail provided about each element. This document is an initiative of the Special Interest Group for modelling and simulation. The Special Interest Group for modelling and simulation is a body open to members of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry and the European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry.

The consistency and asymptotic normality of these estimators are derived using the empirical process theory and convergence theorems for sequences of weakly dependent random variables. Simulation and analysis using Framingham Offspring Study data suggest that the proposed methods perform well in finite samples.","inCitations":["b0b000aa475650d344e8472f20180ce02781c99d","f511a5db52f4c3129bb1d1f08ecc415620f5e8bd","74b2dcc6f5b00245a0b199cf1bb1dfc64ab67424","3899801afe3a4dd3136cf84ae44c2e0d39be1a83","c3ba4ef1eb69799ccf25fae4ea9a89da6ede0d9b","e903abef8362fbddd2bca1f79279e310a38508af","889a5c91396e792c380565080efaebe4e42d9d6e","86aa31ceb300683c7d329a750b18dbec940dd68e","484a69c0a4f8f79a20c0d160b2cd5ed6842f3cc3","8ea7ba113265d1c06903a1b6e2dfbb27e2b6f0d3","e1147507aecbc4851f37a175149543800d7c0743","169fabacf102a8101ea9de8e73a59c21d6a4567f","c947df1d5f1fb04bd058a7b0af777240cc2275d0","1226141f26cb60ba388610cf154ecae68542d148","b0c9d1fbd55a979037a0028b46953318a832aa4c","5575e8fb518e7bda7e1e692b182209e0b1e76e41","8f928856bfe767ede5047c699c7ebd4684495015","30dee1f5fca6bbbaf127bb3dbdca4144776b10f3","065235b7c933d91fc6118bb2540ea585e115c608","05d8c3ed7fbb5820739f6aae36da5fbc7b8d0553"],"title":"Evaluating prognostic accuracy of biomarkers in nested case-control studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr021"}

The explosion is predicated on the concept of strong control, which is satisfied if the probability of rejecting any (i.e., one or more) true null hypothesis among the universe of primary and prespecified secondary hypotheses (sometimes even the tertiary hypotheses) is at most 2.5% (one-sided). The desire of strong control is rooted in the belief that it could lead to more commercially favorable labels or at least placing a sponsor in a better position to negotiate the inclusion of some important secondary (and even tertiary) endpoints in a product label. An unintended consequence of strong control implemented in the previous fashion is the blurring of the lines between primary, secondary, and tertiary endpoints. The latter led Snapinn and Jiang [6] to conclude that it is time to let go of these designations and simply define a set of endpoints for which strong control is guaranteed and that any significant result within this set is equally valid. Although we can certainly understand the logic behind Snapinn and Jiang’s conclusion from the statistical perspective, getting rid of the primary-secondary-tertiary designation ignores the clinical implications of these endpoints and how an intervention is generally assessed. For example, a clinician is usually interested in secondary endpoints if a new treatment appears to have an effect on the primary endpoint(s). Not surprisingly, clinicians often want to know the treatment effect on certain secondary endpoints, especially those related to clinical outcome, regardless of their membership in the set proposed by Snapinn and Jiang. At a European Statistical Meeting on Subgroup Analyses organized by European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry on 30 Nov 2012, Rob Hemmings [7] commented on the importance of bringing all scientific evidence to bear on decision making and that in many instances it was appropriate to give greater weight to biological/pharmacological plausibility and replication of evidence, including external evidence on related products, than to individual p-values. Even though Hemmings’ comment was made in the context of subgroup analysis, which is another source of multiplicity, we feel the comment is equally applicable to secondary endpoints. In a recent presentation on the update of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) multiplicity guideline, Benda [8] commented that clinical assessment often ignores design. So, although statisticians are busy developing and implementing the next generation of MCPs that offer strong control over multiple endpoints, there has been relatively little self-examination in the statistical literature [9, 10] on the relevance of applying stringent strong control to secondary endpoints. The decision by EMA to update its guidance document [11], and hold public workshops [12], highlights that there remains some controversy amongst both the statistical and clinical community. The rigid adoption of strong control would result in many standard or seemingly reasonable approaches no longer considered acceptable by statisticians. We include some of them in Table I; in these examples, type-I error rates will not be strongly controlled if it turns out the null hypothesis, for at least one primary endpoint, is false. In some cases, even if strong control were felt necessary, the increase in type 1 error rate is marginal. For example, when considering group sequential designs, if a secondary endpoint was tested at a one-sided 5% significance level the maximum type 1 error rate is 8% [13,14] and furthermore, this increase is negligible except for a very narrow set of combinations of primary to secondary endpoint (high) correlations and true treatment effects. So, is the complexity of a sophisticated MCP to secondary endpoints a worthwhile endeavor in such a case?","inCitations":["12100b5c77ce39695df8c640e3516d88e654f08d","373a0cd7973ef82407f5a23c01cf9d7471296d78","de04efbeaa999bb02e3d8196632f5bbbdaecd975"],"title":"Strong control over multiple endpoints: are we adding value to the assessment of medicines?","doi":"10.1002/pst.1574"}

Most existing clustering methods are typically built on Euclidean distance and geared toward analyzing continuous response. They work well for clustering, e.g., microarray gene expression data, but often perform poorly for clustering, e.g., large scale single nucleotide polymorphism data. In this paper, we study the penalized latent class model for clustering extremely large scale discrete data. The penalized latent class model takes into account the discrete nature of the response using appropriate generalized linear models and adopts the lasso penalized likelihood approach for simultaneous model estimation and selection of important covariates. We develop very efficient numerical algorithms for model estimation based on the iterative coordinate descent approach and further develop the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to incorporate and model missing values. We use simulation studies and applications to the international HapMap single nucleotide polymorphism data to illustrate the competitive performance of the penalized latent class model.","inCitations":["4eb37f8563f567ea78ca57fe5198979e9572a9dc","d5dc300e9466145a54490bb708138b28d3d0ba9e","2bb31058c0224a46008d899fd0d39e819cb941cc","7b34993a56792a1ced862f8f1e0d1aae0753d8bf"],"title":"Sparse cluster analysis of large-scale discrete variables with application to single nucleotide polymorphism data.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2012.743977"}

Coarse PM concentrations can exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity because the particles travel shorter distances and do not remain suspended in the atmosphere for an extended period of time. In this paper, we develop a modeling approach for estimating the short-term effects of air pollution in time series analysis when the ambient concentrations vary spatially within the study region. Specifically, our approach quantifies the error in the exposure variable by characterizing, on any given day, the disagreement in ambient concentrations measured across monitoring stations. This is accomplished by viewing monitor-level measurements as error-prone repeated measurements of the unobserved population average exposure. Inference is carried out in a Bayesian framework to fully account for uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters. Finally, by using different exposure indicators, we investigate the sensitivity of the association between coarse PM and daily hospital admissions based on a recent national multisite time series analysis. Among Medicare enrollees from 59 US counties between the period 1999 and 2005, we find a consistent positive association between coarse PM and same-day admission for cardiovascular diseases.","inCitations":["7e247a3d722e63eab0521a55d655f840be8203a4","539c6d484aaaae20bf5bd9504a18ef4b78e2ccaf","7d78e995cd9981cbc02351ce219cbd930cab16cc","75dc26a5a9f5717c47eb1265ecc40d07d720cc7f","19fae0910c8d104831edc0646dec4a15201fee0d","0c2f49a240b096a324831ce64f411366623fb6fa","244a3576a14e7201c4d16e1240c3da72d2c94b1d","53243856459cc524105a216063d3717db6ce0d33","fbe72f5a7a4707c19ccf10018bca6c9e85964a86","9acdfc07a39d33a0eb904facccdcf93268f67f01","1613d0dca895d69ccac17360812f130187de5437","01e3d9c92e5a2b4a95a417ef48a05a37039c3918","836c042dd6c81a46c8872fb08c655974fb753189","1e28d534a28d39d2548db8856b5035e5028f6853","bca0db1f8f75891a1ec302ab0252439ef92c38ea","094e0288f663ab0a2d31bfa33e7aa69fd7e44cbf","e316edd2b3281912da6d5c7429ea2395916cbd2e","5a5bd4384c6fa7ffcbc042767a2fa9c642e3d837","e420e146a693955775c1ef7d889d189c03f3f64c","bd654302d2e5af3a4721e514b1c291166138f0da","277f1ede3930fdc88f219ba4557b4a1d45f55108","b8bd79ded2cf2082f662c1478e3b17e090ae7868","8a3ebdb886347c3373e96d58bd3fb1e4f8b3882c","573ea1897375364061cbeabf486daac61f62b164","8946dc5d9f7f32765640a190fe6321368c14cde3","80374dc331cdc1a200002e3aec38f832bcdbbe26","15c556ffbe76d2fce718d258aaa0868e8c320b2f","9d51c6989f89b52d284abba3072470b831e563ac","1de694f82edf2d85d181baea8b37bcf895178b52","cf8813ae9cd746d21d5b9e6f4e398df911880952","4a43163892d4d3321a866fb0853ded424323e2bb","6fc7e34a27c06c2c4f1964ff97bfa051478e392c","7fac8a1ac34052d0f4a8379d00990a526808bd7e","29c564224151ccaa5caac72c0ca2c5fcd99ebbcc","cb3f4e8aab10b3a98f97312cd93b0c82b631959c","2a4a325fcea34a241f9ca63db522b09aa8c00bbe","cb0fbdddf89596832237ef100e8fca0601757f37","5b51551aef961ffcfa0be7efddf40c111aa026da","8855177783598a869a75f087657193148c52592d","0e471022646748372800be966c1758e84cbb43e1","8574fc5c7e6d7e1ab54fd79d5bec6ebc13323121","871f54291032571d2145fb13fe4cce42bd79c10b","141038945459de77d3b6ce5a15c77a19704436e0","c530c0e5b9fc7aadfe4ed73d2005ef9b7ef78e6a","d6ba7435c67cfd8b553abfaf1d823d1965aed32c","c6b149b70c368c61f7f4a9075c3929e4398cacd5"],"title":"Estimating the acute health effects of coarse particulate matter accounting for exposure measurement error.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr002"}

This pharmacokinetic activity for an individual is then evaluated through a series of summary parameters, such as area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax) and the rate constant lambda, and it is evaluated across individuals by descriptive statistics of these parameters, such as the mean and range and a measure of spread such as the standard deviation. How the pharmacokinetic parameters are derived is described here. It is demonstrated that the assumption of an exponential half-life is often fundamental to the derivation of pharmacokinetic parameters. Given this fact, one would think it logical that data are analyzed with the appropriate statistics on the log-scale and not by summary statistics, such as arithmetic means, on the original scale. Why arithmetic means are used to describe the data is explored and the special nature of the log-transformation highlighted.","inCitations":["1e639e4499adb485f1b59072ea05305946429083","9b93171cd68ee6b40da46a4f7201d9f9022ea02e","bb2881c436353e11c4283fb90c7e4de0d1f723c7","a5003d35dd391210d8b7a2935bc43cd567560c8c","d12d980ab30453ce19910cd69d743ea9592f3ca8","d49f9ec8be916bb04b12e5a30924cd7ae62bb843","3145b86db4a968d2e3359e19124675d9e3d386c3","7e5f28743c16eb5fd93f2334ca1169efdb66db0f","3051975d3ae5ef8b582015f9fb917352a3992381","9bc743daf589dce2ee683f7aa9303113e02a708b","d993120597ba47cd3c8ed12a7eca20904c5817e0","ad755feb7c525e9df1e1389eb660c9e20e5e0762","f64790f0a987adf0f275d5879b450a536b76ec97","8dd710795c1ff452101015afe22467293ed8706e","255c9814338f84af6e3a6028745c1d21f394475e","1a738e79c0f7cadaf86ea9e8f4c6644d2c0010c3","7aebb75ca1656b3e497de161770b4a26b1d41188","30722f850e8c2891ca62be51622767dc03799085","47fed96308aea5543f4f299d2fad0d9f24bced5e","52d4e98cd1f546512173f5d90d4b5e6eb442b4fc","fc37e2dc201730a77eb61fca230bb63245776eee","971a544cee2a20a154cce9b046c08375798f62ec","676cab82bbc83086882dcb8e2bea374e594f2bcf","740618e2fa58412276a1c76c1e8e86920376f5e8","b3325f9be0df6ac33e1036e2c409d7ee29ab0c69","73b96155046a21b969f8bb0b6c57271220085308","8fcf61d8563330d30fbd0c26584de61826d4c0fe"],"title":"Why are pharmacokinetic data summarized by arithmetic means?","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101013"}

The methods are illustrated with application to a medical study and to simulated data.","inCitations":["0aeb98f1d9493b80710a9d719b8ffd7c317e6cd0","5d7bf26925300bc8a0c5857e835643545a7d339d","eca6907079113345687681df6d9611058f4e1670","488a684eb26bdec8d322596fe92e723adf822ea3","9c4dc4a1dfafe989160d04c3c0185a3b8e5c49ae","f167a9db76ffcba11bacc46273bbcf95dc6689d9","f13750921095708d7b346bb1baa3f60770431c92","5c4dfd1b4bf27299f050b94e868882c49315bbbd","1f84c6bcf5e3d60488485d31fb6fc6267a86490c","09a296f93fa54550f07a748139b69f7d8c431ff4"],"title":"Propensity score modelling in observational studies using dimension reduction methods.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2011.03.002"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2014,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The commonly used statistical measures for assessing agreement of readings generated by multiple observers or raters, such as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) or concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), have well-known dependency on the data's normality assumption and, thereby, are heavily influenced by data outliers. Here, we propose a novel agreement measure (rank-based agreement index, rAI) by estimating agreement from the data's overall ranks. Such a nonparametric approach provides a global measure of agreement, regardless of the data's exact distributional form. We have shown rAI as a function of the overall ranks of each subject's extreme values. Furthermore, we propose an agreement curve, a graphic tool that aids visualizing the extent of the agreement, which strongly resembles the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We further show that rAI is a function of the area under the agreement curve. Consequently, rAI shares some important features with the area under the ROC curve (AUC). An extensive simulation study is included. We illustrate our method with two cancer imaging study data sets.","inCitations":["85fd02c2846558a2a0f2606ab6305c65a5326485","22b514ec9444b7e255a36bab9935c6e3c9c11c3b"],"title":"An AUC-like index for agreement assessment.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.901345"}

A unique property of the method is that the treatment and outcome models are combined via Bayes theorem. However, this estimation procedure can be problematic if the outcome model is misspecified. We observe feedback that can bias propensity score estimates. Building on new innovation in Bayesian computation, we propose a technique for cutting feedback in a Bayesian propensity analysis. We use the posterior distribution of the propensity scores as an input in the regression model for the outcome. The method is approximately Bayesian in the sense that it does not use the full likelihood for estimation. Nonetheless, it severs feedback between the treatment and outcome giving propensity score estimates that are free from bias but modeled with uncertainty. We illustrate the method in a matched cohort study investigating the effect of statins on primary stroke prevention.","inCitations":["da6f1c5c512d322e21733638a5a367f2c5680141","baaca250ff8c068aea5e25d2d46c3ea0096e3590","9bfc0d4f629370ad0f68aeb2cf575abe32610f5b","58ddf1e97d1c0d0c66a7aa21413ee72a16992f4d","2a682ecead09c2bd0951d1ec287ce7fccd33ae96","d9f8a90651476802f3399c199cfa822cca672f91","71912c67b5d964401f19011252405fc913baf0e4","db2cbaad33f28ff58d021a5ee2c96ad4c1d48baf","739c13c724fe71d6eab518f24bd572ec226b15df","14be9854cc41f0b6f8f3971f38b5da8b2fe579f5","6d70d62b9321f5ffae212ee1beb021ce92854c38","0370f51709e034ea01911594c2917d86602f538d","5cc8bb722a7dffa5353c646fc8f4429cfbd2e512","cbf653ace0930b9ed7838b0db67596c13827b77e","d51bc90bf3b44c807a97f480fd179e5f2cc241e1","ac0763a6374cbf288b065f94ea441d8f64eded7a","b547700cfc2928c88bbe1a09b542ae00ecb38d19","ab69e1056dd6d7853a16544bfced418c29fcd5fc","8ad8ab753cb33fbc6b53e4644a87b9a2c712069a","9d198b0741ace752d7728a40d6a6f7974c98af7a","d9df01b123790fb0ede60eef5fc934a9eeca262a","31e6bec78cb52eaf3988965bc8da87d713329baa","33b7ccc1102517752a643e28cf339b8572b9bdfe","cf56e5449bd9e2db35b3a6443e2e3502558359a6","7b734bb3bbd7badc2e50e62edd75649f0f19d818","2492c5a2c571568f0c5fe8572c00dc6445d7ddce"],"title":"Cutting Feedback in Bayesian Regression Adjustment for the Propensity Score","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1205"}
