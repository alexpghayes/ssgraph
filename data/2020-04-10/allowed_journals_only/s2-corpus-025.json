Despite being decisive, the question of the relative strength of penalization is often glossed over and only implicitly determined by the scale of individual predictors. At the same time, additional information on the predictors is available in many applications but left unused. Here, we propose to make use of such external covariates to adapt the penalization in a data-driven manner. We present a method that differentially penalizes feature groups defined by the covariates and adapts the relative strength of penalization to the information content of each group. Using techniques from the Bayesian tool-set our procedure combines shrinkage with feature selection and provides a scalable optimization scheme. We demonstrate in simulations that the method accurately recovers the true effect sizes and sparsity patterns per feature group. Furthermore, it leads to an improved prediction performance in situations where the groups have strong differences in dynamic range. In applications to data from high-throughput biology, the method enables re-weighting the importance of feature groups from different assays. Overall, using available covariates extends the range of applications of penalized regression, improves model interpretability and can improve prediction performance.","inCitations":["921f533c0179c0c024b61103fb3302c3689b9fe3","5d46f878634106235bd7b851b10264cb2815be2a"],"title":"Adaptive penalization in high-dimensional regression and classification with external covariates using variational Bayes.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz034"}

These often show overdispersion and autocorrelation. To date, almost all analyses of such data have ignored the communicable nature of the organisms and have used methods appropriate only for independent outcomes. Inferences that depend on such analyses cannot be considered reliable when patient-to-patient transmission is important. We propose a new method for analysing these data based on a mechanistic model of the epidemic process. Since important nosocomial pathogens are often carried asymptomatically with overt infection developing in only a proportion of patients, the epidemic process is usually only partially observed by routine surveillance data. We therefore develop a 'structured' hidden Markov model where the underlying Markov chain is generated by a simple transmission model. We apply both structured and standard (unstructured) hidden Markov models to time series for three important pathogens. We find that both methods can offer marked improvements over currently used approaches when nosocomial spread is important. Compared to the standard hidden Markov model, the new approach is more parsimonious, is more biologically plausible, and allows key epidemiological parameters to be estimated.","inCitations":["064dad41537783c9ded17f997441302f87e7248e","54d28526e2705a229930d601cd6728ee4aa94574","f6b5375a1931e1c57d7c4751b8fea8a933978c5b","990ca152433bf72e191e825b217cf756fea73649","9a7900fee0dd7ec516e01b7ac44fdb7cc8366a85","00f069336509457bb963c9f5f9cac26d5cc71b56","b4e01696a70c4ee5c97dc4d354ad0557f14d9ee8","38f193f2fb83a4b6248dad590845d83c7e3ca633","49ea0fc5a7f55f740dd4a5159ed7178fcea07911","8668570185b78a32897d43d36b4db4a524e8aa60","27b6d4ad361023e8777ae63ba38585e54c1186ad","77912dc277ce05518956375661bb78b1b61fe489","600e8fba699669f496224f1ab80caa3df030a77a","7323febfbd1c053d55f80dbeb4aff5c82e0a5d85","e4468c2217c9f4e668f751704a2ef6be5a849e48","c26e0883d46a55f6fc3a9970340abd4b86e4630b","9cc0534fb1e5181fa20aa2891f5614deab6b87f8","df7217522d0ca05dcbe9fcbd248323d129647409","a3de313c4235416a3a155a4bf154221a068ba051","f665485df47389b70df37ec038e736b60bd0c020","3bda59b46ff8ac9d5c2d3e287860ab4692e4e080","328c554e4b92f2bd09752ee5ffd7b7d843255d98","749c4075726fdb90004ce6ff072848c294d7ecc6","176e13f48f5d250401263f1c454b45add308ec4a","81b00ce6fd547d2c130988ed05e9b7a33a25ca31","6cdca12f8df9cb0c7965eddeaa3a3ed6153a13b4","acc15279e17fe948bfc350d9568c499d4a497c9f","f5f570f4f24126086b068d90b54e0d4fc04f5ea3","ab017362ee59b3489abdf866dd686cc1b8d74aec","43ea48976ec2261df1008bc31accad9a8e6dbb97","055030f4e25a9f493ad756f7cbb3f835a639aeed","6f34fb47b58fe7e0408dc216e05c92986d0c18cd","2e5c3ced239d506873437133ffc0b70ed4f96d54","8ef63634f5ae5241ede601e5f2816a91974a9cbd","2c2440e4e71d4d318463023866efb1d911e8657a","90e32649233112f82d5b51078f803b23fe6286b1","305d5f39d631b593d5c3d69e8a9a42d7de151828","3be7aa2679be5744db7156cb758714b0837a4986","e7c3ecfe6f4766a204bf3b161cfd314cd7928456","92066c26f5c618b58a854b7bd3185b3addc00021","679a663fba768dfddc85b748e4ef1e59ff793f3b","c1237a448da37c1008ace4a4516e5c2a2427f60b","cf8335c7b85522c89599d8f0a6c3b9881fc5927a","b4d0e245a0f0c73e34ee2e8587ce70c3d6302969","0c5326d6b150869268768f579d84f20ea1868999","c9d90eb5367b92759a89992713007be752bcc3d7","1f8dbf7b0d3adc27b870eed795848ff567d6e020","7dfe06e3318ee08364d80b0b481640c85fb9e993","7958531331f69eecd9a76f3bdcc162a06b14abe7","d9606aac0f64f74c0621e0c8c0dc52fa9533fb16","a3484f7b39bd4f6f6ebc257ee03d4a2a2b3dba57","48f5bdab8842f99bac55ecf88b0b3b6ab7e080b0","8cead4ba0c40ca5b9bdf2d55e909394ae1464351","5a5c08cedd2cff1740f447d0334ca2af3e5670c9","4e11da65dc80926c287e4984b66741bc59c9867f","e689f06b76c3f505e2815109b0f456622f84b40f","f80449be6b4161e9a1b21b0d902f3a48abe588ba","44b4472625effc4d52f8f6a4604b916ecb272bb5","14cf1f1f6d036c41a7bc931a89508e8ca874a8ac","dbef556c2c796a7174839bf61a9bd4397cb315b8","1e00135001e122bfdd594642d8277036913dee20","1ddf3f2ccffc32d30dc7995af3a16968256eab6a","326a05fd2fdee71d0f5c5f741a62c8fed1996149","f8ebdf809102b4e5157c2236993b14ed06aefb57","9def33400348aa78036b3cea0e956d8c506172d3","fb735597292ee38d0dd2ff564a722ae371965c7b","939d8a5cd646affc010a13a4ef2348d2a4f2b1d9","e9ee028829d97cce760072c4b9cdbeff1aa036ac","1e02fdc8d8f1c4a61685a4d12ad8cb6d09590381","8c450ff88e3c2f5e69bdd43ede0a9e5457ddac96","2194611798d0f38d07dd7654e6cbcd93c4c3a3eb","5426e4ecc0cf476e27a9fe5ddcd5f7a14e9ae22e","c1f10913ce6a93f97c9c264f4b360f1feb9a62f7","b1a74d2ef4f64d4fc4f59321a6a765cc08f046cb","6d34bad0bad49eeab23e58451cba493aa690d637","d255f34cc4198a4ff2d8911d9563f07fc18d3460","62dcce67d569d542dc8af2dddd4d00818ae48d4f","1b1c60daea330a884e9a0796dfccdefdd6f125dd","3fb8ea24f0872cb002b70426576b46940feac6ce","99bbc5592ee170b83e72d68fed571e2a17c7f333","d83934ed3867e2009d195a2fc57c54dba413b3a7","e1780fe44d905aa0ce0adb7798f2f309d2e02703","006a05b4c57168ea6c23f5c112d39574d01ff8a4","e6e8cbd2bc9a4384a9e0cb3b472cbf55131ae0df","7f5b4872c8753ff61f3f4b1ebd7a96d40efe1e65","88df407cc4fa57842d39f0bdbae9180dc0b0a15a","f2fc92d61d0583fbdb5a7e6a43d1ea9c453108ab","d92633f09940c411ea1e07638426f1d74f32c253","f7c9053759a55b59e2cf20760e300ace38a492e2","b9c5084088aa4281d0d0bfae2aa24135649d3454","dee85f94212eff29fc09589306634236645712b2","451252bf72a7fc84a2f92c73ca3fa8e2b5d219b0"],"title":"The analysis of hospital infection data using hidden Markov models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.2.223"}

Well established statistically, the estimator defined as a consistent root has, however, rather poor computational properties because the estimating function is neither continuous nor, in general, monotone. We propose a computationally efficient estimator through an asymptotics-guided Newton algorithm, in which censored quantile regression methods are tailored to yield an initial consistent estimate and a consistent derivative estimate of the limiting estimating function. We also develop fast interval estimation with a new proposal for sandwich variance estimation. The proposed estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the consistent root estimator and barely distinguishable in samples of practical size. However, computation time is typically reduced by two to three orders of magnitude for point estimation alone. Illustrations with clinical applications are provided.","inCitations":["5d0168ab41e03ae0f18f04ebf9193080e912a3ae"],"title":"Fast Censored Linear Regression.","doi":"10.1111/sjos.12031"}

Such attempts employ technology to deliver integrated, dynamically linked, interactive content and multifaceted learning environments, which may facilitate student comprehension and information retention. In this manuscript, we describe one such innovative effort of using technological tools for improving student motivation and learning of the theory, practice and usability of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in probability and statistics courses. Our approach is based on harnessing the computational libraries developed by the Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR) to design a new interactive Java applet and a corresponding demonstration activity that illustrate the meaning and the power of the CLT. The CLT applet and activity have clear common goals; to provide graphical representation of the CLT, to improve student intuition, and to empirically validate and establish the limits of the CLT. The SOCR CLT activity consists of four experiments that demonstrate the assumptions, meaning and implications of the CLT and ties these to specific hands-on simulations. We include a number of examples illustrating the theory and applications of the CLT.

It can be characterized as a multinomial regression model with crossed random effects that reflect actor heterogeneity and dependence between the ties from and to the same actor in the network. Three Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation methods for the p(2) model are presented to improve iterative generalized least squares (IGLS) estimation developed earlier, two of which use random walk proposals. The third method, an independence chain sampler, and one of the random walk algorithms use normal approximations of the binary network data to generate proposals in the MCMC algorithms. A large-scale simulation study compares MCMC estimates with IGLS estimates for networks with 20 and 40 actors. It was found that the IGLS estimates have a smaller variance but are severely biased, while the MCMC estimates have a larger variance with a small bias. For networks with 20 actors, mean squared errors are generally comparable or smaller for the IGLS estimates. For networks with 40 actors, mean squared errors are the smallest for the MCMC estimates. Coverage rates of confidence intervals are good for the MCMC estimates but not for the IGLS estimates.","inCitations":["9fec68fbb94d9950d61ae29c11090318a6be728f","d6620ab1b35216e6afbb655ffbe8a9a3985adb9e","15b9e544de7a7bd45084b847e71195c338a1bde8","d7aeca8b11521bdc428ff2112e3b6be3b1d50783","319fb11ca9e5106724f8a270daa7cf55b02611c1","c0e8cc769e9d6c39957d96f1a58da60eb029d707","613735c75d6f2cb12e1a4a7739f17f3c88eff72b","0e95fec671a06b1cb6a21af0d28f2ea2547da201"],"title":"MCMC estimation for the p(2) network regression model with crossed random effects.","doi":"10.1348/000711007X255336"}

The Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry on Assay Development for Immunogenicity Testing of Therapeutic recommends the cut point to be an upper 95 percentile of the negative control patients. In this article, we assume that the assay data are a random sample from a normal distribution. The sample normal percentile is a point estimate with a variability that decreases with the increase of sample size. Therefore, the sample percentile does not assure at least 5% false-positive rate (FPR) with a high confidence level (e.g., 90%) when the sample size is not sufficiently enough. With this concern, we propose to use a lower confidence limit for a percentile as the cut point instead. We have conducted an extensive literature review on the estimation of the statistical cut point and compare several selected methods for the immunogenicity screening assay cut-point determination in terms of bias, the coverage probability, and FPR. The selected methods evaluated for the immunogenicity screening assay cut-point determination are sample normal percentile, the exact lower confidence limit of a normal percentile (Chakraborti and Li, 2007) and the approximate lower confidence limit of a normal percentile. It is shown that the actual coverage probability for the lower confidence limit of a normal percentile using approximate normal method is much larger than the required confidence level with a small number of assays conducted in practice. We recommend using the exact lower confidence limit of a normal percentile for cut-point determination.","inCitations":["e07e32a5e21cc7d474cf39f5872aa717d3259899","6a8ecfe0f4d6926f23238ea4074cb2d9e563850d","894bd11e4c723a8186e7291494d52d5aa6ba637a","823d4751c0c9363445917c5c07ff790199d83286","5ea7038ee451db934586799ebaa9b3c01ae087a9"],"title":"Statistical evaluation of several methods for cut-point determination of immunogenicity screening assay.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.979196"}

Specifically, the data are assumed to consist of final outcome information, so that it is known whether or not each individual in the sample ever became a clinical case during the epidemic outbreak. The objective is to make inference for the infection rate parameters in the underlying model of disease transmission. The principal challenge is that the required likelihood of the data is intractable in all but the simplest cases. Demiris and O'Neill (2005b) used data augmentation methods involving a certain random graph in a Markov chain Monte Carlo setting to address this situation in the special case where the sample is the same as the entire population. Here, we take an approach relying on broadly similar principles, but for which the implementation details are markedly different. Specifically, to cover the general case of sample data, we use an alternative data augmentation scheme and employ noncentering methods. The methods are illustrated using data from an influenza outbreak.","inCitations":["1082e0780d31099ab560094d40660cf285102e13","acc6264c7e4a901f46c22151401a9a49e7e836d9","11691631ad534cae90f5f4dd5326bbc4f8c13d0d","9e9de6acbe7667bb61427c198a1fcf6094cd9a6e","c76ed5d11109aff397e064d48bc12394c2ffa6db","e662711a613b35c6e6119e9236a9758b94bc8b53","8bd2070171b4a277a73d52c047d76472eb90dc6f","1b3ef01b1a344cde4a231b55c08a36950251752e","b57f55cc4205dad5ded3c16e455a4330dbac335f","09cf5dea7c0278eea01af8dc43fd0d75a6bd21e2","6229d5dee39d7405da85abac3acbd375542a55c2","bc7c5c73c960fe92899600015a8b1b370826b80e","49402d3ba9f93d60d63f8e5735831bb365ffb1f2","b047ef5e2ab2b9f310374a5e78919af581f95951"],"title":"Bayesian inference for stochastic multitype epidemics in structured populations using sample data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp031"}

An additional complication arises when the response is censored, for example, due to limits of quantification of the assay used. While Gaussian random effects are routinely assumed, little work has characterized the consequences of misspecifying the random-effects distribution nor has a more flexible distribution been studied for censored longitudinal data. We show that, in general, maximum likelihood estimators will not be consistent when the random-effects density is misspecified, and the effect of misspecification is likely to be greatest when the true random-effects density deviates substantially from normality and the number of noncensored observations on each subject is small. We develop a mixed model framework for censored longitudinal data in which the random effects are represented by the flexible seminonparametric density and show how to obtain estimates in SAS procedure NLMIXED. Simulations show that this approach can lead to reduction in bias and increase in efficiency relative to assuming Gaussian random effects. The methods are demonstrated on data from a study of hepatitis C virus.","inCitations":["ed5cc571ba6d813464aedbf2b95fcc1ba64e9bda","4e87e08c7a1c195e038a9c294fdb88676634d07c","0894ea2db9a1501d60202619b5a45e42ec946565","34096b63e8610db31b9d0769e9eb732d781d684f","b32dab82a2263f6aa7fe3dd22d036b61ab4c0b6b","ecd4d9202dcfa9caa8fca56ba87398499838a507","77aed8e2d3bc0d94dc498e3bc415927a5b36c51b","6a24df6b39ca40bcf87f8f2fe7738b900a3b0828","1602fe7f62e21f48e3f1759bdf7e3a2da7f264d6","47cb0f5664ce423baf245986445b011abacb4b21","53ed04442c6756daa7c6539763340c35297a1c81","3de7302cb343d187b528a4a8cf2a8e725d93c1a4","e444309839ee9727157b6698933b4026f49e243e","75e0663e53b226a3f3854d3a0da7c3234686253a","bea5b79045a55c315ac3040bb44e89c82204b2cb","14a8ca247695229fb1fe4c8cd24120b71c723a3b","b5f73d4202b49298c4b115b4cb95a48ae03b7ed8","4529d9f54b3de0e48ae1bce992fa002f24553024"],"title":"Mixed model analysis of censored longitudinal data with flexible random-effects density.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr026"}

The key idea is to treat the latent variables as hypothetical missing data and then apply Cook's approach to the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function in the corresponding EM algorithm for deriving the normal curvature and the conformal normal curvature. Building blocks for achieving the diagnostic measures are computed via observations generated by the Gibbs sampler. It is shown that the proposed methodology is relatively simple to implement, computationally efficient, and feasible for a wide variety of perturbation schemes. Two illustrative real examples are presented.","inCitations":["5621859a6501ec659c6685d29fcd42069d57598e"],"title":"Local influence analysis of structural equation models with continuous and ordinal categorical variables.","doi":"10.1348/000711003770480039"}

The allocation scheme maps the covariate-adjusted odds ratio from a logistic regression model onto [0, 1]. Simulations assume that both staggered entry and time to response are random and follow a known probability distribution that can depend on the treatment assigned, the patient's response, a covariate, or a time trend. Confidence intervals on the covariate-adjusted odds ratio is slightly anticonservative for the adaptive design under the null hypothesis, but power is similar to equal allocation under various alternatives for n = 200. For similar power, the net savings in terms of expected number of treatment failures is modest, but enough to make this design attractive for certain studies where known covariates are expected to be important and stratification is not desired, and treatment failures have a high ethical cost.","inCitations":["429c1d11cb38eec4b006ce86ddecb5379e03388e","0412f3a3c864a4ddfba7f93c462c3b7899a9979d","00f7380be3a1763a4b2e5166c46960886938753f","5cf6d63f4e168ac404752b493579aa13ce7852d5","ebc3df8c7b24c45e7fa4fd0d18361c535aca3496","ce6ff3449fbc917e614f612da50b72951ded2d31","24d52eaf4f28fb428b88b09b28aab94ba2097c25","7cc08f0d5d377e5db4a1063a00d678bfed08c3c7","55b133c5fc2f118b3ae80b45520b4e7a26dc503a","bdb80c08715ffdee36d45ff026da25b2b27e357d","12078e7da0faf9edccdee5566f0fd70ee4002a3b","19437fc756e412a803bff7e67e493fa0a1711801","2beef38f5a3b7a2fd52e64d2b5a7f7cebc5479b4","22ede5ecd73ea793ab020456b4b5f9aeba48160c","d6b5569405f9b2f969c7f3a5f70d41f52d8940f7","340347bd17e086097302afa9715b6cc2dd187b84","78130ccfee15137c39c8576c8c6d9fa1f163893a","1b3824f6f96041bab23e29c8ea929fbe3dff2ac8","77630ac8d3273e9d73f87258531149d7bf20144a","a51a4d378dfb4a6ae60aba43844f36e8955030d5","fcdcdbbd328821c18fa8b679a30d15ba5fec18ed","feaf019139fe5e1361733be70910074fb133a9ae","8227e530ff47bd641d0cd21cf306346e345173da","c8ba468854e7ca95a5fc93bcd1de5feb18e75e5e","a46359175c18ad09fe2b7634d0fac890cc91c0b9","6f05e239dfc93fac762ef5cce9069fe91620bb46","47cfa9723231dbf18595f1e4120bb84f5c75791b","537004c297ad363e08fc0857e1bd810da7e2945a","4d505614c026b76bdcc6b9e3d40f6e7d82e2356d","a704e4881615e6edcbbd7708d012f6f96edf578e","0d842c5e68b3f84496a909b898a06dc7ed82143a","b7b13265ad876c761837456d26f699fe97a3643d","fdbff10773f475eff3256cdcb1565c3a163feaa3"],"title":"Covariate-adjusted response-adaptive designs for binary response.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120008846"}

It can be formulated as the solution to a convex optimization problem, which we solve using an efficient alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. This algorithm has guaranteed convergence to the global optimum, can be easily specialized to any convex penalty function of interest, and allows for a straightforward extension to the setting of generalized linear models.

We investigate a flexible semiparametric density ratio model without the constraints of the constant disease incidence rate and discrete covariates as required in Shen and others 2012. For inference, we introduce two likelihood approaches with distinct computational algorithms. We first develop a full likelihood approach to obtain the most efficient estimators by an iterative algorithm. Under the density ratio model, we exploit the invariance property of uncensored failure times from the prevalent cohort and also propose a computationally convenient estimation procedure that uses a conditional pairwise likelihood. The empirical performance and efficiency of the two approaches are evaluated through simulation studies. The proposed methods are applied to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare linked data for women diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer.","inCitations":["b7f58537b878a487201bfe2213a2b5cfc8b13792","9fd6262128740213a29d9f97ee16edb1ae3b5a0e"],"title":"Semiparametric density ratio modeling of survival data from a prevalent cohort.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw028"}

If such measurements are contained in the remote tail ends of the true population distribution from which they are drawn, they are referred to as outliers. Neglecting to filter outliers from a sample can distort statistical computations and result in faulty conclusions. Conventional techniques identify measurements, whose distances from the mean exceed a selected multiple of the sample standard deviation, as outliers. Such approaches, however, can fail to classify measurements with large normalized distances as outliers. The truncated outlier filtering method first replaces the minimum and maximum of the population before computing the exclusion criterion. This mitigates the influence of abnormally large (or small) measurements on the normalized distance and hence yields a more compact criterion for outlier determination. Moreover, the method generalizes to two or more dimensions. Simulated one-dimensional and multidimensional data are analyzed. A discussion of the results is also presented.","inCitations":["7ed4423fad2230b18d2ca24d325f43888ea6ea01","e6c8a913bff310aa8c071a87926b8fd536734e68","27e631465e624475f1be155d3e1454339ee686e0","4ec6f70658b29c78c98b8657511530dc53685a64","835e11827f0d1d13639d4ec8f65b5695146c5489","23ed58b594d25a29795c70a43b268dd6558d6f39","fa1a258356910977413e0cce0b23b57615e5f538","4b2c6b1583ccab176107687255fd1c8483e2e35f"],"title":"Truncated outlier filtering.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.926366"}
