Kang and Schafer (2007) demonstrate the fragility of double robust and IPCW-estimators in a simulation study with positivity violations. They focus on a simple missing data problem with covariates where one desires to estimate the mean of an outcome that is subject to missingness. Responses by Robins, et al. (2007), Tsiatis and Davidian (2007), Tan (2007) and Ridgeway and McCaffrey (2007) further explore the challenges faced by double robust estimators and offer suggestions for improving their stability. In this article, we join the debate by presenting targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). We demonstrate that TMLEs that guarantee that the parametric submodel employed by the TMLE procedure respects the global bounds on the continuous outcomes, are especially suitable for dealing with positivity violations because in addition to being double robust and semiparametric efficient, they are substitution estimators. We demonstrate the practical performance of TMLEs relative to other estimators in the simulations designed by Kang and Schafer (2007) and in modified simulations with even greater estimation challenges.","inCitations":["d901577cf2b93f5964999ac014ce1111f2854577","2172fd75b7e6e8db47d8f709ceda45c60029363a","b32f130cfe4e0daf5a6be97cac57cec14427b8f2","d766816b34730ae1941fa82dfe68d31751ff1b08","e8f90a401965acca05b6adcc7cb50d7e685be1ee","8933ca1e36478b5ddc2ef37fa8d33583f0784f2e","fb721f1a69544c15426c266afcf3c84eed269d9a","2edc363b9b5ac16c7eac6e57950c8ad8bbb95cd6","1dc23732b894045439682a4cdf29e585c2eab7a8","5ff53b360307c85d37aee4f8f7445f8472d2e46c","209928f2019676a868b7f0becd4da023e77a086c","371e53ed0c775d757b0552367c36f0d1c1a96755","6ce72fcbe684ed330c52995a9614fa1434b3be87","04bd3574794891c3f7c5038abcab7589002fb85e","4ff698c36a414594b32ee35ff150daa4d6a2e47c","3f45990ab8b1230226a56725e5a6e04579e3e0d6","c275b73d4ef6f383b606a451aed5b6d6a540c571","81e6c40c6335543ba14a3b4917e7b18f4984b449","502d2021172009794c5398b88e4631688262af6f","d8c6d8016d9b0d53262d131d540a1629e316545a","18205fb6d7d49e0f96b78debb396315001c33a2f","a39cd2f881a71b887bf821233290647c58876dd5","1943807b60041e6b37062e38e6b42f5efb050111","48d4f716939215907dc51d5bbd6d45c7b05f0e29","4b36bbb681b6f236bdc21adb1d2380a5d17a8f09","d6464d6790a01e8a2d2b883d5336f1ec78399113","e3bc464aaf1b6ea3afeef2e295e63e4230bf4251","d237d0b857fc17692f3e970460e1103415126ddf","e158ea00669155bf8614a70604f04fbb6753f447","7136ff99fb115b986bd5a8ee20c831600ee2e157","618e232c5d120cdbfc703ae3a88049e8fc320243","b17273bfc7242acb5469de6c9486e332db2c7b45","9db04882f45e8a7faf024093e9d3626451de75ae","33b9b99a7e821e751f5aba1a12245fde5d279951","539c34ac53ccaa05fcffbad93804964ff839c6a0","8a07f471a6d291eeb2f5106373d30f995d54cedf","639270edb1064bc9c5cdf0ece3cb53e1f812fcb8","c68796f833a7151f0a63d1d1608dc902b4fdc9b6","1d436d34ade8e5195864dc7a060e05e8f984929b","fba6430dbf9559f26b1a996b71902f22ff2c93c0","e22ff66105359b033de05f2468cd989906682773","1baf0ad74d5816659db5819e4b6ebfd48052b5a6","b6d77285743714db09463240543560025c6ff301","e0b46984b9e267f5735340bf8e3c508b2264894f","1acfe671c0c8676cb456000c987340b6e5a51fe3","edb794c2503635050e08c532c83fe32c025cb694","fdc1d1ad167a9a8f4e4322ceaff533d8f3e1f308","e6967dfdf2c3fb5c9a3d053427038a89105585ca","7d5f6745f4be932b7336b1e321fa62eef966945f","3d6a508f65f5e30ea242efb3c212f44b2184bac3","5e941c25d03ef71a50679b3f7d1ab044023ed59d","db5043638485d7203aec46bd367fda6fcfdb0f3f","d9717c53d893c435be06205f0893cf9dae78b04c","b0b2c40e5689c5e0f6cf234d2ad48c6151da2efc","4148fe08fb08438f0453327b8d3eb654cb87bfde","f2ce04b0811dd2271ffb44c2ec3830d7d5d7fae7","5190fdd5cd9163316084838cbcd8916facb617b3","3ea7389157feed8b5b8a5aa335817c21b67b1f62","28ff16c4ef76c35a44e36cc9376c11ce45c95339","c432126dc077167d3454f5a5b664d1c6b993d408","552c3caa1f9a093f1ace36923fdb10e999a02b61","f410a02773766057e8981eff5719f07dac7e74b9","add3d74e2d21b4a2ea849af90d7821cfff3516dd"],"title":"The Relative Performance of Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimators","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1308"}

A multinomial logit model is used as a base classifier in ensembles from random partitions of predictors. The multinomial logit model can be applied to each mutually exclusive subset of the feature space without variable selection. By combining multiple models the proposed method can handle a huge database without a constraint needed for analyzing high-dimensional data, and the random partition can improve the prediction accuracy by reducing the correlation among base classifiers. The proposed method is implemented using R, and the performance including overall prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each category is evaluated on two real data sets and simulation data sets. To investigate the quality of prediction in terms of sensitivity and specificity, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is also examined. The performance of the proposed model is compared to a single multinomial logit model and it shows a substantial improvement in overall prediction accuracy. The proposed method is also compared with other classification methods such as the random forest, support vector machines, and random multinomial logit model.","inCitations":["12aceae436c6acd0e80e6050e026917bf8f2f85b","78d1d895fd3dc8fb16de6eeed07bb0befe0f84a4","392a3b3752b43c196171a3b5d4bf0863c8b4fde6","458e1e88fd2ccfa1b771d1c0435cb59b714d18b3","afb0533600ae5213d2f25a4f61df00a9fa1d891f"],"title":"Multinomial logistic regression ensembles.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.756500"}

Such evidence typically is based on the test statistic of the largest magnitude, whose statistical significance is evaluated by permuting the sample units to simulate its null distribution. Efron (2007) has noted that correlation among the test statistics can induce substantial interstudy variation in the shapes of their histograms, which may cause misleading tail counts. Here, we show that permutation-based estimates of the overall significance level also can be misleading when the test statistics are correlated. We propose that such estimates be conditioned on a simple measure of the spread of the observed histogram, and we provide a method for obtaining conditional significance levels. We justify this conditioning using the conditionality principle described by Cox and Hinkley (1974). Application of the method to gene expression data illustrates the circumstances when conditional significance levels are needed.","inCitations":["24c5eca628031880b92c70b0582f729cb7a82f9c","dbd876812d6c67a14eab27579551d63520494e90","6c05e53043a79c2d81513c7f837f285d8139606b","612c885364f37690f3c6c2e06a220c395ed51f59","0c42f65699508bb2faebe485ea8512642d4e7714","7ba8e010a6a3b671872d5ed5fc28544d8e86f7e2","4146d18028a7dc7ee525e1828b311042f40e7543"],"title":"Significance levels for studies with correlated test statistics.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm047"}

It often uses electronic devices to obtain information on psychological state through administration of questionnaires at times selected from a probability-based sampling design. This information can be used to model the impact of momentary variation in psychological state on the lifetimes to events such as smoking lapse. Motivated by this, a probability-sampling framework is proposed for estimating the impact of time-varying covariates on the lifetimes to events. Presented as an alternative to joint modeling of the covariate process as well as event lifetimes, this framework calls for sampling covariates at the event lifetimes and at times selected according to a probability-based sampling design. A design-unbiased estimator for the cumulative hazard is substituted into the log likelihood, and the resulting objective function is maximized to obtain the proposed estimator. This estimator has two quantifiable sources of variation, that due to the survival model and that due to sampling the covariates. Data from a nicotine patch trial are used to illustrate the proposed approach.","inCitations":["6da39d0d4df877b8068b3d1ca02d9634baed2740","7191ad7625acb37e9a71402efbe475cb51390dd7","2806719e1bddcbb9ba31e46a6c024890788a3ad0","8c8be3a9dc97c444e763539902e23e8bd3b82a5d"],"title":"Survival Analysis with Time-Varying Covariates Measured at Random Times by Design.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2012.01064.x"}

We investigate this problem when multiple cell clones are observed longitudinally over time. The theory of age-dependent branching processes provides an appealing framework for the quantitative analysis of such data. Likelihood inference being difficult in this context, we propose an alternative composite likelihood approach, where the estimation function is defined from the marginal or conditional distributions of the number of cells of each observable cell type. These distributions have generally no closed-form expressions but they can be approximated using simulations. We construct a bias-corrected version of the estimating function, which also offers computational advantages. Two algorithms are discussed to compute parameter estimates. Large sample properties of the estimator are presented. The performance of the proposed method in finite samples is investigated in simulation studies. An application to the analysis of the generation of oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte progenitor cells cultured in vitro reveals the effect of neurothrophin-3 on these cells. Our work demonstrates also that the proposed approach outperforms the existing ones.","inCitations":["bf8463172a3d7b88d047c7a167fdf7381c8063d1","c747b85f532e8e1917324470390eec4ec5044dfd","2f74aaf703b1c6f6990108d615a133710c2d673d","b69bc4c9b3dea653297e63b5cf9d6488c4d8c4cb"],"title":"A composite likelihood approach to the analysis of longitudinal clonal data on multitype cellular systems under an age-dependent branching process.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq050"}

Similar past studies have been small in scale and have provided wearable GPS devices to subjects. These devices typically collect mobility traces continuously without significant gaps in the data, and consequently the problem of data missingness has been safely ignored. Leveraging subjects' own smartphones makes it possible to scale up and extend the duration of these types of studies, but at the same time introduces a substantial challenge: to preserve a smartphone's battery, GPS can be active only for a small portion of the time, frequently less than $10\\%$, leading to a tremendous missing data problem. We introduce a principled statistical approach, based on weighted resampling of the observed data, to impute the missing mobility traces, which we then summarize using different mobility measures. We compare the strengths of our approach to linear interpolation (LI), a popular approach for dealing with missing data, both analytically and through simulation of missingness for empirical data. We conclude that our imputation approach better mirrors human mobility both theoretically and over a sample of GPS mobility traces from 182 individuals in the Geolife data set, where, relative to LI, imputation resulted in a 10-fold reduction in the error averaged across all mobility features.","inCitations":["efdc983419116e9b5b838c91aa00f90a8a5008f2","07b6033f56638b6a96aabde2aca06dcbec61d91e","d1892eaed0ec08f807577047b9ae766235b61ebc","acd07815a623973781119bbadf5896d63a9d53a8","cce98e92446548536c2e16e7be75e488177cd60e","09504e09ce1e176e7d8b47daa0e67fcae6d0f420","bca100edca37391488eb2ee1fd42e1c325b43f47"],"title":"Inferring mobility measures from GPS traces with missing data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy059"}

Sample size calculation depends on the variance of the statistic of interest, which is the difference between receiver operating characteristic summary measures of 2 medical diagnostic tests. To obtain an appropriate value for the variance, one often has to assume an arbitrary parametric model and the associated parameter values for the 2 groups of subjects under 2 tests to be compared. It becomes more tedious to do so when the same subject undergoes 2 different tests because the correlation is then involved in modeling the test outcomes. The calculated variance based on incorrectly specified parametric models may be smaller than the true one, which will subsequently result in smaller maximum sample sizes, leaving the study underpowered. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric adaptive method for comparative diagnostic trials to update the sample sizes using interim data, while allowing early stopping during interim analyses. We show that the proposed method maintains the nominal power and type I error rate through theoretical proofs and simulation studies.","inCitations":["d6a2f3955cb5a70c2f66aa1b33f629b6a308182d","f51b5cf45958620f3f24068e9e80415a5504295a","520f56d1c9260ce5b76dfda5259b593d9044c1e0","948a12db688e884414251664b0559e61d0e61b04"],"title":"Sample size recalculation in sequential diagnostic trials.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp044"}

There is, however, a lack of available procedures in commonly used statistical packages. In the present study, a generalization of the aligned rank test for the two-way interaction is proposed for the analysis of the typical sources of variation in a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. It can be implemented in the usual statistical packages. Its statistical properties are tested by using simulation methods with two sample sizes (n = 30 and n = 10) and three distributions (normal, exponential and double exponential). Results indicate substantial increases in power for non-normal distributions in comparison with the usual parametric tests. Similar levels of Type I error for both parametric and aligned rank ANOVA were obtained with non-normal distributions and large sample sizes. Degrees-of-freedom adjustments for Type I error control in small samples are proposed. The procedure is applied to a case study with 30 participants per group where it detects gender differences in linguistic abilities in blind children not shown previously by other methods.","inCitations":["284f6c41a281e7aef999950fec7065c0db7724b4","3bb3b8c27ad9c61c1f6b63f7ca4f67a7e0167703","444a500cf37399e35df03be98b6023fb67d28c5a","0e5a383b8ca1e8c7bbcce842bd7cabf8856c2806","f9df7dcd74a8f67b07c82e682b8cc888e70676c6","a1fbeff6154c7b549ab7299443a159c368454938"],"title":"Non-parametric three-way mixed ANOVA with aligned rank tests.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12031"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2012,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In Clinical trials involving multiple comparisons of interest, the importance of controlling the trial Type I error is well-understood and well-documented. Moreover, when these comparisons are themselves correlated, methodologies exist for accounting for the correlation in the trial design, when calculating the trial significance levels. However, less well-documented is the fact that there are some circumstances where multiple comparisons affect the Type II error rather than the Type I error, and failure to account for this, can result in a reduction in the overall trial power. In this paper, we describe sample size calculations for clinical trials involving multiple correlated comparisons, where all the comparisons must be statistically significant for the trial to provide evidence of effect, and show how such calculations have to account for multiplicity in the Type II error. For the situation of two comparisons, we provide a result which assumes a bivariate Normal distribution. For the general case of two or more comparisons we provide a solution using inflation factors to increase the sample size relative to the case of a single outcome. We begin with a simple case of two comparisons assuming a bivariate Normal distribution, show how to factor in correlation between comparisons and then generalise our findings to situations with two or more comparisons. These methods are easy to apply, and we demonstrate how accounting for the multiplicity in the Type II error leads, at most, to modest increases in the sample size.","inCitations":["446945bbfffc2397d71b4674a9c5d4ccb3c11d4a","89c84096110e3bbbe88cd829238a348b8c139902","b620b6e2b431b5a494c5f27326c8e81c7787b7d8","2dc1d1afd133f4a0004d41bf67f4e0f2867568e9","6ea392364945fbd1bd006b14738f7bd35dc1c38f","c8d3b03fc644a027db6cfd9b57773dd1803101bb","5b7b9535bc674cb9a75d523bd89f1691dd24578a","fd3b413e23fa3aca511afeea010305ddcbfa06f2","2b7b0617303c9db7c87efaf801d32cec09a2ce72","9b81b893874c42cdd1f94bc74bba07630af990c1"],"title":"Sample sizes for trials involving multiple correlated must-win comparisons.","doi":"10.1002/pst.515"}

Virtually all standard statistical summaries of predictability and discrimination can be derived from it (Gail and Pfeiffer 2005). The goal of this paper is to develop methods for making inference about risk prediction markers using summary measures derived from the risk distribution. We describe some new clinically motivated summary measures and give new interpretations to some existing statistical measures. Methods for estimating these summary measures are described along with distribution theory that facilitates construction of confidence intervals from data. We show how markers and, more generally, how risk prediction models, can be compared using clinically relevant measures of predictability. The methods are illustrated by application to markers of lung function and nutritional status for predicting subsequent onset of major pulmonary infection in children suffering from cystic fibrosis. Simulation studies show that methods for inference are valid for use in practice.","inCitations":["e7412758b2ea54732a98d08f2d9a48097692eb09","d0b1e0704bb0858434619f12abfca4b09aca289c","ae3da88a2c9574bf8199dcb9d84726994b70a63d","f2663e8bb6209b592fa89a326c585eddb3432464","c37d30f7162e7fec10a9bc3fd36277151c177c71","a0f46fbcf4aef69eb8d13f641ca6a7378b5cccf9","28afecb517bc4f1d263d4a0553519a0c008d7686","da328318c510f6b8384d7f08c1f78532c4a23d04","19a3235c6cec4c00ca62991c5f51c68e11b66fdd","12cabe8d15ff000125512f1c3a88f0ffa660a1fd","6e897a8ce77e681610039f9467128a8e375f35bb","f4663a2abef2072a96417a6937ba8d243133a16b","43623c98784574b75632c71b39bba05bc567cf0f","9a5f28e2465e227f16ce564609ae23efa905de64","ead8112bdb40b9df0f30160cc307fc52a1d0e5e0","496f405c9533e6594d581cf6798c5747777fe74f","3e2c205915eab5004f581833ed12681a2fbe683d","0fdf832ef96f797370fbb6e31773b977d435e995","d9a441511fe2bf3bcc8af918f221d8bfdb876771","85bbad7d2826844bd0557456313ed63c3b23600b","b4c65ac6786cdbff2cb5e3112305eef493e08324","425fdeba502b2b97a9ccca79425847814c3c8841","5e89f9e7f0dc3a763e1bfd25ee5ed389c7ffadce","6c69f999ba8e8a0734bf30d4fc793ab989111dbd","08f51f93ab9f92e821111d33c871d4cdc0e11c17","479eb8d3248a2d69eded1174ca4b62e748d58198","f2cfbc8d98fa666c9779bd74b25373f6225d383f","30dee1f5fca6bbbaf127bb3dbdca4144776b10f3","aa731ef748995ce3cba67ca2402ae15811c533fb","b921cd3e99739412091acf65ca54c0f7e07d0273","fdadc663eb74f5bf5ddee00889e50f7833a5e2a2","1640ee3ba7dce4036f158edfc26727355cb1dda0","62293af30f6250d09b6f160ae4411912d15eb8ae","37078b946a23f77d9f6685c64143dcdcfd6bba97","304c41a7e0a9cdce92c3fb65b2a8153de099b10e","f17b328a5efa76a2c084a9aeffcd1b12cc5fc0fb","75123ed6976eb286f73919fc9cbcaf9d43805752","918d90ab7cc883f664648558913670034fa89b9f","71dcb641dc68cb5b8ea44e349110385cbf2b24b2"],"title":"Measures to Summarize and Compare the Predictive Capacity of Markers","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1188"}

The conventional statistical method for such a comparison is a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, which provides a P-value for testing the hypothesis that the distributions of both treatment groups are identical, but does not provide a simple and straightforward estimate of treatment effect. For that, Hodges and Lehmann proposed estimating the shift parameter between two populations and its confidence interval (CI). However, such a shift parameter does not have a straightforward interpretation, and its CI contains zero in some cases when Mann-Whitney test produces a significant result. To overcome the aforementioned problems, we introduce the use of the win ratio for analysing such data. Patients in the new and control treatment are formed into all possible pairs. For each pair, the new treatment patient is labelled a 'winner' or a 'loser' if it is known who had the more favourable outcome. The win ratio is the total number of winners divided by the total numbers of losers. A 95% CI for the win ratio can be obtained using the bootstrap method. Statistical properties of the win ratio statistic are investigated using two real trial data sets and six simulation studies. Results show that the win ratio method has about the same power as the Mann-Whitney method. We recommend the use of the win ratio method for estimating the treatment effect (and CI) and the Mann-Whitney method for calculating the P-value for comparing continuous non-Normal outcomes when the amount of tied pairs is small.

When an investigator is designing a study to compare the outcomes of an intervention, an essential step is the calculation of sample sizes that will allow a reasonable chance (power) of detecting a pre-determined difference (effect size) in the outcome variable, at a given level of statistical significance. Frequently studies will recruit fewer patients than the initial pre-study sample size calculation suggested. Investigators are faced with the fact that their study may be inadequately powered to detect the pre-specified treatment effect and the statistical analysis of the collected outcome data may or may not report a statistically significant result. If the data produces a \"non-statistically significant result\" then investigators are frequently tempted to ask the question \"Given the actual final study size, what is the power of the study, now, to detect a treatment effect or difference?\" The aim of this article is to debate whether or not it is desirable to answer this question and to undertake a power calculation, after the data have been collected and analysed.","inCitations":["9c6ea18adecbec9e9f6120f7598dfd1e5f74160e","73105ef79eac39d05a146dc8974b9741f2531095","89b6ceaadf53b7ff16c46641be5fb0d59e621089","573f7ac4242894fae26370afde7212d21aca9390","375ef27bf8d5a26cb7eadffb342ec17bb4a980b4","bf977e763f5590600541f26b2c144ef48bb84293","e782a0a6d43d1ba18f29c2990600ba918229a732","3ea076b65a9054562628fb1f2b0bac44f1a6c081","67f5042991899dd355c912c200a707abe46eee1c","f063dd8659f868dd71d5f283d2aad924a7134636","aa7c73482ef402fa36a404d03272514ccc7a07d1","2d76db850f311db79bc0ca9feef2d149506d6b64","8e4da76c0f9398e55e33849b4b1e940e5d4e207b","5079f381dd6d00209a8b9aba24e4ebb0c49a2b2a","53a3a65889bdc0a3e8a264ee6c5a9caea4c05fc0","da15b1484259cbbe2fcdc1f74e2d30579730daf3","6debdca9a3a65e7f904e7758436d26253723f64a","8d11fa3b4fdee3935380b312f6fc53da3078d54f","91e3caa8cfef43eb4a7505da7200a4042f978e77","ca79b4b5fe709c6705f6eb75d555c4f226a82563","a67897a338b9af35173be19e7aebacc2f5ede083","80757267ecf42cb3b951c7c9e7f1d53e18415202","6ea392364945fbd1bd006b14738f7bd35dc1c38f","b4fdc7b949645799be4bb748a2bee4ee4979210b","3d929ef5b405f7f70803ec236d97e59f7912c33a","b425f2382c35274aba37a7de336f328672e5d8c5","f82273c8d234dcc9ff0e8b50beda879558ef199b","2da981d0e722b03a3de0c0109913e58dfdc438ff","945668f5b1a3389696a4d3a2924c18810ead35e2","3497b9b9e8bb0a2fdb846c57bcae6b3aa7d0c1df","a15ee51749c3c349bcb552d017da9db523d880cf","7400c617a6d7aaff6bf11be4b48110540de6d7bd","f36990a740b4801ebf2c02c7f62a398fdde22f7b","76d4e7ff153205e20da16cedc8972cc23b24a47f","dd170055c1509c2cb6f75afdbad78143f66f36b6","c35eabb53ec55d073bbb970f1726a675a0830ea7","a685cb6d5e2e417a96943ee5ef38e49fdcc6d506"],"title":"Consultants' forum: should post hoc sample size calculations be done?","doi":"10.1002/pst.334"}

In particular, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) includes data from several diverse genomic technologies on the same cancerous tumor samples. In this paper we introduce Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE), a general decomposition of variation for the integrated analysis of such datasets. The decomposition consists of three terms: a low-rank approximation capturing joint variation across data types, low-rank approximations for structured variation individual to each data type, and residual noise. JIVE quantifies the amount of joint variation between data types, reduces the dimensionality of the data, and provides new directions for the visual exploration of joint and individual structure. The proposed method represents an extension of Principal Component Analysis and has clear advantages over popular two-block methods such as Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares. A JIVE analysis of gene expression and miRNA data on Glioblastoma Multiforme tumor samples reveals gene-miRNA associations and provides better characterization of tumor types.","inCitations":["a1bc0528973f53dab6b52ea276bb15b5c6af2e81","f92ab323b24a32b149ca5a9fe2c29b157d77ba03","4c168f00b4e979ca5a70d29eb2cd3b667c12cc24","50f19616e02174e076efe69a27f87ab094ae75e6","1dbe3483cf65d337f73316d90a5f9c4ce5c304dc","6020b69bc6834dc905d26c91be165c29de8347be","bb80d65f3b64c7c466bcba7df02051d3e90732f7","8ac695915fbf74dbfd0a684e7ecafd6848d7fc54","7f30a36a3faab044c095814d0ce17ea2b6638213","89a29e0c1f374ff266840288571db286d763c14b","49df88b8b1cf5fb12193045c43cba82adfae50a7","bc50c4165013202f0a76213f1ba91bfc551b1585","5c9ca16cb2337fd5948c7af28c29c156981250e8","9e1955f569252f2701f9f84997e18cd4bf43abb1","cba4fb40688c43d45f45f91d1800f37675e24ad0","8005ff193f47ebb6df3144c7a3c30b63b2056ad7","19666b9eefcbf764df7c1f5b6938031bcf777191","ca161e7f5cb49740a5841361003b2d8a875d45ab","d0456100e2dec4adc544bb11e8ab56534dc2fe3e","bb85bd0dbf209864b3bcfda158fdf9000a375962","9727cbbb95a4960a695e19a7a8f8381d9d933951","7a17888cb7b96c5abf46602bd2eb489069cfba62","c2904cec5dd8f7f4aeaaae089c974f97e4a3d1f7","8d556ef63d43775d88284339728080ceebc169de","23795554f2dd56d3ffb304aec428b56eba01194e","8774ad202b6ecb08da11f81f269de89f06b8db94","a9317328119302ac0c705181a9cb28a8675afddb","95b832c945484446d005613760cc0c5bf7e51c16","48d157370899d4c9b1f43c51b4a61ee7f476dd26","80759b83d8f74aaf528639766fc75371d063dee0","258223f066787978bfae3a21724167faa93ca927","37635860ef389f6e13c3fee178a81134cf3a76bf","5496cc9b02459fbb87d785e68c3f766b5f6c5869","fc6103fa8000d5455c758e4b045aa3cae9880e6b","89d0fa44780392e2512a1a3f48ed71d010a8de72","13842dde517aad270a5e14ac7304059073874214","e3ba727f47365044a7120e5535e7ec0f1cd7ac5c","2aff62f1a1f5d6ca34feff3ebf8aa48376bf79f3","fb372a0560f6d72a4b02f06f5b3149321f437cfe","7eb3b93d7fd17f8a049c25d43a331db6dfd207d5","8b86981689695c92f1e47590a9736899bb380e71","c1c7892d9b315b1ea81af3aad2d3bd0c6fdb8866","d62b13a030b9fbc9f033fcb9e6248d6ed395b9f3","a6927967cc987ad5f0678be0218b94bfed737453","4dd6f04c6b1a21e152fcc70ea817671d70060f7d","bacec2bca97cfe6265d7cfc75fafcb34b47aa36d","e6ff8949048ca2ea2a17211c728131403b49bac1","d6fed0803ca4961d853b2c14b3bce1d23d7a9701","3340baaeb7bd656547ee331d128f83663fbe1ec3","4cdcb02a55640cca316f60d9eba9aa9fca5716a2","4905323aaf61952e07f62c18fa662c7da895e40e","af102c07d0749c0ee6849d8e8a743bd2ce498500","43845cf0b02e52bbe57ad7876c029e5165fee26a","096e5785b7a7265ccc7cea64790ffd9ab1d50798","65c0c6f73697a57b9f473386b0f6414b1bbbf180","c0206de6f103232a98eb57203bd3821f43b1f190","e4fb33c42d8dd6b1202d79a947c21440cdf28637","33b2f25f27a11b76a7ab3ad3342acee0d0bdfb36","bd9d5cf54744fa9c3aa15ea3b4441cdf76347411","9e6552b421fca8acddf00489cc523197018e1162","d58f02794f12cd8a274266f36239e172cb0ea4ed","eda066fed23fdb472978f845c124252e4fdf03a7","cd488f98a32514990b49b54f422a0257892c31a0","1df9134d61f16271cdd4537c446b2546d0c72a61","6dfd30f432d4f778cb9b8da3a6b12000e8672558","fa21b5bfb54d5773a0ab79a7c000f3c78928c5f1","7953e9ad29893cf8320134a4567e5382f1545a3d","8d71aaf8611fb62d5624d221e1899a9d69e62c5f","cd6d7cde5bb28e5f43f8e0f2b6d793bc7f952de4","f1d7db9aa55a0164712df61eb36e036cd98f0b0b","afcd19e8e56db90cf31c6bd7055bd95425447001","7767288ff4e0ac90abaad4a38a3086917b9a7757","96b575e85e4bb5ce1e6831e3a2ac6722123d4fbe","000777e06f4ba43dca6ff2cec750b30d1927b164","561b6892fcb41f9399072a362381e89baa26c53b","8ad6da1c4a699af5694d6c6c8e6af1cf5d3855ab","f22bcde65fe3529549b21191e865bb0e19b31445","9fb3193bb84ed26e9c6290e5468474b1d4beae31","516600be5e1ffea32ab1c21f0553d8d01295d69b","cf457fa84df0254ac8041078eae629b44bd76bce","9e5507c635376a894bcc7f22563b899da1306b93","68d61d5673a1ecbe3e40a49797a9bdfd0b418fcd","223e5f812dbbb97b9949ff6cc8d58aa01d531021","04f1e69af1af9bf6c284d6f902f27fc692255ea2","16a0792b03d475b33c082e02b6e9b5620adad4c1","c96e04c7a85be6b80594134da97fd3e69c25176d","da5c44b8b27508b46ab4968ee0bd9392cfd2a0e9","ad5f0fa8ddc9fb2a0d95303c2014993a647d0e6d","2268ea2d0391108d367b0b053d3ec670881d7c9a","0126e4bf63f8ef3d2e57addc29bb2adcc1d262ab","cbc4095f823fc6693c8832ceab05b3b635485903","67f6f92ed73cce139b103fc1a2c4599a9638bf67","85b15b25460efc1141af2e1ae8d106ab6bb9d32b","cc3151f7992f7125e81ae687b90379465f88b744","07f39d48132d467cce68fe253aa75bbfff68427d","5bd15ede14885575b3c9d718139821d65aba36f5","a02195792273e558f6522ee5d76f90c4dccf4325","8826aee72c6d18fc99d4a1b5b074128730f3e1bf","e124d9685dc9c78882b8ec33b96a5f43fa8f3df0","846149c81df8c6195cc29ef70f3983d2d4ba48b7","6a869548a4a943ab4d5662525d6dbfe57bd56f2d","d7f2c3edcf3544c595074255b05fef3c8e029153","abda95719e89d0bc20ebafc96ba57b924c04356b","0dda6eed5215c3dca6e239eb97fef1bd0863a8e5","73e90eb0ceb15441e761a2335e2cdffe3054c0af","22b406212bde1db9278fd1cea39f5f8ac1c128d5","1794c9b7ced485a8755db5b378653b773a00e52e","204dcf95be7ca3e483b5ffd81e5006e2202f960a","e460ce35072b349a32c244b2053f273a7573a55f","78d5a7ca5d637f96d6d6dfa717c06a56b0b59992","05243aeed0b8c724354691980488c844e6029652","abd3b35e1d5143840a6277c8c70b16672f07b038","cbfe1b9ddb7734c3b88f44da970806ff97b9b121","25c4cfc306c5cdc853e4c241e2a2877dffc521aa","609acca61131a603462fbbabaa20018c54e14487","95c5184834870f3ea25563b820ab31c

We examine the effect of medical expenditure risk on the willingness of Medicare beneficiaries to hold risky assets. Using a discrete factor maximum likelihood method to address the endogeneity of insurance choices, we find that having a moderately protective Medigap or employer supplemental policy increases risky asset holding by 7.1 percentage points relative to those without supplemental coverage, while participation in a highly protective Medicare HMO increases risky asset holding by 13.0 percentage points. Our results highlight an important link between the availability of health insurance and financial behavior.","inCitations":["c6b2be0f99d494ea806a98415f91af9f12d36a19","3014ecaed676546a045f1bdee573133b63eeb2e9","2e08f5568c55433ebe7135642835b846b92078be","f3c9d2a911c447c52e6816841b3fc8f518236469","058efc0bd8842b6cc432889c312d8a24ab365e13","bf492e1596466f5352b96e18d17decfc945c88b8","a18ab5ba5959e4ffd0818c03ebe5eba98612f9cf","a54839de68eef81630a5a4d498faa2da7c036b73","fa1e6033bf3d06d21bab28c81f2acce5a965ebe7","fff96000f494ad254b39ea4b957628b284491999","d6c0ec38e3fcf7b809b341a7d52dbdb519851213","d92a0553270dcd6f242a86eb4a862d77059b22c1","c1937c28a399367f0e51f51f7768f83d8fd8f871","1978f44f3c117580721a5122224b3e9a6b2f37b0","08f1072d1ba6854ac4f0e62864e1f55a3d0a881a","4ee1e002cd75ed33d6e6d0c4b44e427373314b51","d8b9ebae0e2303050877319f529f7e94501aaf0d","a130f8c68e4ecebbab6a4a00be2e2ccb9885df8e","e298d676a7f52638e212c2b2fd0ca490775bf56b","def74e6cfc59fa7e31c6d16bf4d4ce4c913ab81e","d048d9a1ad5efa984c86d2dc54b70465b7e92faf","1c1ed2fb107733cc73e398a7f8d9c4370a5d4fd7","565677b1ec98f2a7eb741c756c09c9122d62cff1","35f88818839e592b9b3bb4c1f4d568c1e2453c11","6d4b7142210c2ffcc43e3e879c5bf7223327e3c0","0fb56de34a1dadb2697bd4ccf1ec5dcf4a1e2014","3bd68a21013a3543c5c0f86baa6dbebd896e4212","8179beec1022babdfad559ba86af21fd7b035828","beddcc1dd683d67491c80ca231e661c962f5d307","597c69a56e3cd8b4bdcd3e9c29a0804fd71ce725"],"title":"Medical Expenditure Risk and Household Portfolio Choice.","doi":"10.1002/jae.2278"}
