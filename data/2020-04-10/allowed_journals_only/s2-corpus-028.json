Standard methods such as k-means, Gaussian mixture models, and hierarchical clustering, however, are beset by local minima, which are sometimes drastically suboptimal. Recently introduced convex relaxations of k-means and hierarchical clustering shrink cluster centroids toward one another and ensure a unique global minimizer. In this work we present two splitting methods for solving the convex clustering problem. The first is an instance of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); the second is an instance of the alternating minimization algorithm (AMA). In contrast to previously considered algorithms, our ADMM and AMA formulations provide simple and unified frameworks for solving the convex clustering problem under the previously studied norms and open the door to potentially novel norms. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data examples. While the differences between the two algorithms appear to be minor on the surface, complexity analysis and numerical experiments show AMA to be significantly more efficient.

This manuscript explores novel ways to combine information on terminal and recurrent events in constructing two-sample tests. Existing approaches follow either a time-to-first event analysis approach or a recurrent event modeling approach. Nonparametric recurrent event analyses are often restricted by independence assumptions on gap times between events. Although time-to-first event analyses are not subject to this restriction, they discard information that occurs beyond the initial event and are much less powerful for detecting treatment differences. We develop two new approaches for determining treatment effects, motivated by less restrictive assumptions of time-to-first event analyses that combine information from multiple follow-up intervals. The first testing procedure pools (correlated) short-term τ -restricted outcomes from prespecified intervals starting at times t(k), k = 1, . . . , b, and compares estimated τ -restricted mean survival across treatment groups from this combined dataset. The second procedure calculates conditional τ-restricted means from those at risk at times t(k), k = 1, . . . , b, and compares the area under a function of these by treatment. Variances calculations, taking into account correlation of short-term outcomes within individuals, linearize random components of the test statistics following Woodruff (1971. A simple method for approximating the variance of a complicated estimate. Journal of the American Statistical Association 66, 411-414) and more recently Williams (1995. Product-limit survival functions with correlated survival times. Lifetime Data Analysis 1, 171-186). Simulations compare the finite sample performance of our tests to the robust proportional rates model proposed by Lin and others (2000. Semiparametric regression for the mean and rate functions of recurrent events. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology) 62(4), 711-730) and the Ghosh and Lin (2000. Non-parametric analysis of recurrent events and death. Biometrics 56(2), 554-562) combined test for recurrent events and death. For different treatment effect patterns the proposed methods perform favorably when compared with existing methods. These new analysis approaches also produce correct type I error rates with correlated gap times between events. New methods are applied to data from a trial of azithromycin in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","inCitations":["cb0d8d988b6900e7031d5dcc94badc2a1c1728f7"],"title":"Nonparametric tests of treatment effect based on combined endpoints for mortality and recurrent events.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu013"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2013,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of multivariate analysis","paperAbstract":"Recent years have seen the developments of several methods for sparse principal component analysis due to its importance in the analysis of high dimensional data. Despite the demonstration of their usefulness in practical applications, they are limited in terms of lack of orthogonality in the loadings (coefficients) of different principal components, the existence of correlation in the principal components, the expensive computation needed, and the lack of theoretical results such as consistency in high-dimensional situations. In this paper, we propose a new sparse principal component analysis method by introducing a new norm to replace the usual norm in traditional eigenvalue problems, and propose an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problems. With this method, we can efficiently obtain uncorrelated principal components or orthogonal loadings, and achieve the goal of explaining a high percentage of variations with sparse linear combinations. Due to the strict convexity of the new norm, we can prove the convergence of the iterative method and provide the detailed characterization of the limits. We also prove that the obtained principal component is consistent for a single component model in high dimensional situations. As illustration, we apply this method to real gene expression data with competitive results.","inCitations":["9b18a040b068b100401284979a0b1ce7a817ab5f","a59d59e7dcf33f51b4cef8c04bb46e70da778647","57016de5067fbc76be2b73e50cb2e405d75b8a7b","ce463b1744cce8561acb745426970b67ea807c90","d74fec957777da43a972a5389ed58b8861727e73","89bcfe3baaa1ec1c5c028a32b436b0949495cc02","bda4e2293a5573a798ef53c6013e6d325eba4900","29d240f5da39dc7321ab23bcde7c6fc8903af16f","e5ed363ea16b7612d5380277882a4cb7b5d0d7e0","c0e9324a8eef51503bba8156559f8b4a74488b08","f495d067926e2deed54cc82a799c40f918644c95","ab44cd7511f8797b1494f203c94214daa0e804a3","9f242f2032d6779675565e7b0668820f5810406d","0be8049f6c04528f35ea98b11bbc5b0815caceea","2560a97af4a20b3f7f2f7d06e1e3f402e5144297","1d100217627c21936d702f99bc92021b17d362b8","da9fb423bc2069312b35e60f3ef9275a0c9a649c","88b253749f84701428990b73384baa388883fe62","d2898994f367b30dd5cae199d17805421d7ed2bb","0f7533e7bf9ce40df2df26a969d910cbf51839b6","a507853dc063d08c7d0809500d3f0773de3fc0f0","efc5bbdce5f4603012bdb44c4b47d61fe440c43d","3117350849f7b1651d758862541bfeebf356cab7","9a54adaff26007f2db067fc06238df09ffa755fa"],"title":"Sparse principal component analysis by choice of norm","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2012.07.004"}

For a prospective study with many covariates and a binary outcome (success or failure), relative risk regression may be of interest. If we model the log of the success probability as a linear function of covariates, the regression coefficients are log-relative risks. However, using such a log-linear model with a Bernoulli likelihood can lead to convergence problems in the Newton-Raphson algorithm. This is likely to occur when the success probabilities are close to one. A constrained likelihood method proposed by Wacholder (1986, American Journal of Epidemiology 123, 174-184), also has convergence problems. We propose a quasi-likelihood method of moments technique in which we naively assume the Bernoulli outcome is Poisson, with the mean (success probability) following a log-linear model. We use the Poisson maximum likelihood equations to estimate the regression coefficients without constraints.

They show how genotyping errors can lead to a significantly higher false-positive rate, growing with sample size, compared with the nominal significance levels. The strength of this effect depends very strongly on the population distribution of the genotype, with a pronounced effect in the case of rare alleles, and a great robustness against error in the case of large minor allele frequency.

It is imperative that pharmaceutical products be stable for two or more years. Long-term stability studies are required to support such shelf life claim at registration. However, during drug development to facilitate formulation and dosage form selection, an accelerated stability study with stressed storage condition is preferred to quickly obtain a good prediction of shelf life under ambient storage conditions. Such a prediction typically uses Arrhenius equation that describes relationship between degradation rate and temperature (and humidity). Existing methods usually rely on the assumption of normality of the errors. In addition, shelf life projection is usually based on confidence band of a regression line. However, the coverage probability of a method is often overlooked or under-reported. In this paper, we introduce two nonparametric bootstrap procedures for shelf life estimation based on accelerated stability testing, and compare them with a one-stage nonlinear Arrhenius prediction model. Our simulation results demonstrate that one-stage nonlinear Arrhenius method has significant lower coverage than nominal levels. Our bootstrap method gave better coverage and led to a shelf life prediction closer to that based on long-term stability data.","inCitations":["68b329ad92308022107e24b1b67f734b7bf270dc","ceefdd4b633d0dc997bd194aeaa0da99b2640baa"],"title":"One- and two-stage Arrhenius models for pharmaceutical shelf life prediction.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.972743"}

Internal pilot designs use a fraction of the data to re-estimate the error variance and modify the final sample size. Too small or too large a sample size caused by an incorrect planning variance can be avoided. However, the usual hypothesis test may need adjustment to control the Type I error rate. A bounding test achieves control of Type I error rate while providing most of the advantages of the unadjusted test. Unfortunately, the presence of both a doubly truncated and an untruncated chi-square random variable complicates the theory and computations. An expression for the density of the sum of the two chi-squares gives a simple form for the test statistic density. Examples illustrate that the new results make the bounding test practical by providing very stable, convergent, and much more accurate computations. Furthermore, the new computational methods are effectively never slower and usually much faster. All results apply to any univariate linear model with fixed predictors and Gaussian errors, with the t-test a special case.","inCitations":["a475a57211c5bd2d96867946bb77ee14c62489ab","99a6df30d6ff1bcbf4a57d98b494d1caaa6402e6","43f3529d674cdd693f0013101cfe7329c8d0d86d","e8269f2071766ba8e90037c38f258e65379a26ae","f8816d7ff8a4b51a8e7fdede6ad67dc4a2cd10d9"],"title":"Practical Methods for Bounding Type I Error Rate with an Internal Pilot Design.","doi":"10.1080/03610920601143634"}

For diseases with low prevalence, group testing (or pooled testing) can be used to classify individuals as diseased or not while providing considerable cost savings when compared to testing specimens individually. The pooling literature is replete with group testing case identification algorithms including Dorfman testing, higher-stage hierarchical procedures, and array testing. Although these algorithms are usually evaluated on the basis of the expected number of tests and classification accuracy, most evaluations in the literature do not account for the continuous nature of the testing responses and thus invoke potentially restrictive assumptions to characterize an algorithm's performance. Commonly used case identification algorithms in group testing are considered and are evaluated by taking a different approach. Instead of treating testing responses as binary random variables (i.e., diseased/not), evaluations are made by exploiting an assay's underlying continuous biomarker distributions for positive and negative individuals. In doing so, a general framework to describe the operating characteristics of group testing case identification algorithms is provided when these distributions are known. The methodology is illustrated using two HIV testing examples taken from the pooling literature.","inCitations":["0ca265819955e8aa75d3f65515d82fdba0593acf"],"title":"Group testing case identification with biomarker information","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2018.01.005"}

Quantile regression evaluates diverse covariate effects on the conditional distribution of the response with quantile-specific regression coefficients. In this paper, we develop an empirical likelihood inference procedure for longitudinal data that accommodates both the within-subject correlations and informative dropouts under missing at random mechanisms. We borrow the matrix expansion idea of the quadratic inference function and incorporate the within-subject correlations under an informative working correlation structure. The proposed procedure does not assume the exact knowledge of the true correlation structure nor does it estimate the parameters of the correlation structure. Theoretical results show that the resulting estimator is asymptotically normal and more efficient than one attained under a working independence correlation structure. We expand the proposed approach to account for informative dropouts under missing at random mechanisms. The methodology is illustrated by empirical studies and a real-life example of HIV data analysis.","inCitations":["57b210066e7057b2163c741a2f9b94c68ca60b32","e7552c887355ec67ec3474d48e3c0fae56b9f778"],"title":"Efficient quantile marginal regression for longitudinal data with dropouts.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw007"}

Regulatory authorities have paid special attention to investigating the drug-induced delay of cardiac repolarization. Studies aimed at evaluating QT prolongation have become a routine part of safety packages across the pharmaceutical industry. However, the assessment of QT interval prolongation on the surface electrocardiogram is complicated by the fact that many factors influence the duration of the QT interval, among which heart rate plays a predominant role. Some widely used corrections of the QT interval for varying heart rate are known to be inadequate. Many alternatives have been proposed in the literature. Using information obtained from Eli Lilly thorough QT studies, we examine the performance of several approaches to the analysis of QT changes, including subject-specific (individual) QT corrections and model-based QT analysis methods. The simulation results indicate that the mixed-effects modeling approach proposed in this paper is more powerful than the other methods, all of which are commonly used in QT studies.","inCitations":["b440d5bed8455128138d5575cac8fb0f168f2265","3c5bb4b94722182aed8656e38d2727f781d63a7b","22dc31e427dff34ff849ebaa10dfdb3f5e5487e6","378425018b2fa2b9d570096e6cb76f33c5b895d5","a53fd257da8cca7e76dabff01e6301d2b4245a3e"],"title":"Statistical analysis methods for QT/QTc prolongation.","doi":"10.1080/10543400801995494"}

The problem is that the usual exact CI is the inversion of the test that rejects if either of the one-sided Fisher's exact tests rejects at half the nominal significance level. Further, the confidence set that is the inversion of the usual two-sided Fisher's exact test may not be an interval, so following Blaker (2000, Confidence curves and improved exact confidence intervals for discrete distributions. Canadian Journal of Statistics 28, 783-798), we define the \"matching\" interval as the smallest interval that contains the confidence set. We explore these 2 versions of Fisher's exact test as well as an exact test suggested by Blaker (2000) and provide the R package exact2x2 which automatically assigns the appropriate matching interval to each of the 3 exact tests.","inCitations":["a27f34efdc44343728cdeb12347ffdecd86ed4e7","0cfbd799dde9aedd35ace107455d6b0bee8fa640","87dcf090525614eda2dd7081cf76671d6d80a958","781099ab43ffd21de5a8fdb1e0385fb0872f2617","0e754876ab897538a5aa29bbe67cb8c8cf01449a","1001f26467779cd2d6a3dac4fc3725f29bf22840","5b0f5dbd6e798de9682e85f48b39d5d426fa32ae","d8ed7e0f37831f043ced6d495a688f497fb8cd70","a76b92c1911b0baca3e99ef30a657ee648512786","3652424837fb7314ad45e3f7c5fe8e16c846004a","b796ecc98d08a8ec371db8bcf7078bea75031c24","bf3fcad39b8f4de4a600c7e169547f2bbe2ded76","1b46a8dac9e55b24815a4731183ecbd1caa44a40","7cb325e26126cf2e99f2786865883bbc913e1897","1f55dff26fe489df8dbb928ce5b3e02200c20ecb","4cac7549a04452dd4c48979534d05055e2856a8f","1953534b60e11579d2db5c671b8f51f376674954","e8e98557dcf95523d09b5156b3a1efcbf4bdb6bd","7ccd6854aeb22a449640a361fa782678dc28ae08","14d8a61696644efba595769294fd25b0fa65e715","ad842376428fd82f506b44ad497e85a1b66403f6","d82abae7c4eb8ecc03c0460f9c95b8a1b1b2fffe","41310f57b465ca33ed1a8a9c47c0f2ecd126bb86","89780c4cab5a587949d7561e35dc15e619621ad0","c90ef5d62dacd735d92015de0b94a3c503bfda17","ade007bb3ce3444b990d7c4c5b34be08966181ee","213c46b91054bab89c04188d57a881e3bda20ba1","5d74086a3a49c787a26779e7ad5e3f924ac2ef61","f88223ea12235d84c75b3428a194fd62998c935c","c01632bd8027b2bec2145db64389decbc10e557b","47eb352e3552b5fabdd0d1e3760fabeeb7b77dc8","dedaed71e22188450354fd25b45eb05521b307fe","3d35c35b7edab8a8c15876534fa584bd755a1e54","99e4bc1f9bf07c5aab1abe485f11f2af3992718c","1becc1a558d06a09c4287034e24df75d84ec1877","bf41e9320c642e71e839c2e34662d085670ceee2","f027a0280bd39d92513d0ce6a2b64b7546743000","4ce9bb8a05862af8543f956e516b59baa5f2e1a6","327decad200afaa73b1cbf2314b4c6baca628995","7bdca315fa69d016fb490d0631d6f3a0b93c459d","37a0cd6c98f0406b45880a56187d044bf978cce8","3373e5f8b71bed14aa27ff3ca786907e2bf19565","e52195cf3c5c705129ef90a37f4cd23370ac4805","6ea51efe2425e89cd7ee513731217007442269d3","31c6b68be7a2182ce822452c78d78ee430a781b6","2116ee1dede9b0ed8c0766c1291cde76892e515d","3f5b2a559f477a6df05a028dbf1ffb92e4862bca","6bc5a6d70ecd3691b34de43dd936c1cfed787bc5","c94ca61bdbcee0094b27ea893e772bfe7d80163c","8a03b6ac631947dc0d4d443a8e90403e1c350e22"],"title":"Confidence intervals that match Fisher's exact or Blaker's exact tests.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp050"}

Indeed, factors like difficult logistics or centralized treatment administration promote both complications, their joint appearance is not unusual. Frangakis, Rubin and Zhou (FRZ) present a Bayesian analysis of the effect of AD-discussion in a cluster randomized trial. They limit themselves to analysing just two of the four trial arms and reduce the dimension of received discussion to a binary indicator. Thus arise very simple patterns of exposure, allowing for the careful scrutiny of assumptions which the authors generally advocate with latent data. Taking their advice to heart, we reflect on some of these assumptions first. Next we think through the choice of effect measure and how to generalize it to more common data types. Finally we worry about sensitivity and present an alternative analysis for this data. First, we wonder about modelling a common effect of AD-discussion for all physicians (bQi’s involve no interaction with Zi ). It seems natural that who (and therefore how one) discusses AD makes a difference. Incorporating a random structural effect in the presented model is quite possible though. Harder is it to imagine how one might allow for another likely feature of the data: an impact which the treatment of cluster members has on each other’s treatment and outcome, for instance through contacts in the waiting room. Similar questions and answers arise in drug trials. On the other hand, one hopes that assignment effects in well blinded randomized trials are negligible. To interpret the effect measures estimated here, one must start by considering latent principle compliance strata, an unusual categorization in the practical evaluation of effects of exposure. Let us consider how this would generalize to a more detailed picture of the data, where discussion intensities are measured on a continuous scale with a success rate that depends on the received ‘dose’ of promotion. FRZ estimate the effect of treatment assignment in subpopulations determined by p-variate potential exposures following possible randomization to each of p different arms in the trial. In the simple case of ‘all or nothing’ compliance on two arms (with modelled effects of baseline covariates), one can estimate the marginal distribution over these latent subpopulations as well as some aspects of their outcome distribution. For continuous exposure levels (intensity of discussion) on the p = 2 or 4 arms an awful lot of modelling would be required beyond what has been presented here. With as many principal compliance strata as there are values in part of a product space [a, b] p , there is very little information to identify the ∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed","inCitations":["3e62aefc06952e880d21346dd1e2ab3562197f51"],"title":"Discussion of 'Clustered encouragement designs with individual noncompliance: Bayesian inference with randomization, and application to advance directive forms' by Frangakis, Rubin and Zhou.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.2.169"}

The inherent ambiguity in the concept of probability and the rules of conversational logic are used to justify subjects' apparent fallacies. Moreover even in the framework of mathematical probability some of Tversky and Kahneman's subjects' behaviour is defended. The relevance of mathematical probability to everyday decisions is seen as being open to question. Conceptualizing a problem sensibly is held to be more important than having beliefs which are demonstrably consistent with a quantitative probabilistic model. The conceptualization should have regard to the sense in which probability is being used, how different possibilities should be categorized and the reliability of the presented information.","inCitations":["b6e5679a09d899d447fe59abc36ac4eb910a4662","b44aeabab956afe4f585e78ceab4d33550e4eb98","121df07699e0f723f1fae05ff233b3bc4b3a0724","0f66f494046d2169cc2420656e2bb88b788dfbbf","84bad4c08307f78878005075bd07bbf52348c9ef","391f8def295f26042d1186969df9d0b4889586ae","803b178b9d8b96594bd2f1e7a0050ac90301fe38","41377cc821d532875b369bdacf316d982f19fa85","9fbe056e89ee9517c50e72d74d46b7d1ee5744f4","4613652d0cb50d7f38adb67afa41fbe70644e6e8","c22b277d1c6142ed10977e754411c7d13bfd4eda","d2f53391ff73fac78d3d3c9278a4eee25a2b985f","e09bca5afbff4590262c4481c4dcedd66bb56579","d2255f06ae853c5ce3f7da5e86bb9f59c88b50b3","e8262a55184dc0a1e8fce3477a90f2195e044e76","993f10d9560e91065698599d7a5ef875c394346f","fe75729a90408281eb2bb8a7e3bf33f60942f766","e991303f696bb181357c1425f9266d914655f9cd"],"title":"Credible conceptions and implausible probabilities.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1986.tb00842.x"}

Then, the longitudinal measures and dropout processes can be modeled simultaneously, each conditional on the complete previous history of both repeated measures and states. In this context, Poisson regression is used to fit various proportional hazards models, some of which are new, to the dropout process using the longitudinal measurements responses as time-varying covariates.
