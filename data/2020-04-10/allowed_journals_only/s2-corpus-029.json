Lin's coefficient evaluates the accuracy and precision between two measures, and is based on the expected value of the squared distance function. We generalize Lin's coefficient, apply alternative distance functions, and produce more robust versions of the concordance correlation coefficient. In this paper, we develop the asymptotic theory for this class of estimators, investigate small-sample properties via computer simulation, and demonstrate their use with two real data examples.","inCitations":["95f50423e4659aca07292d13b177214ac3da27ef","bc8a9a729a48dfe914390ccd384ee850d0f5e283","b3470a0b9d4f0eeae6906c25691c56dd97cedd87","2643f69c576d6d8db6cfc82e33713878a0eb8d30","f51fcd24ccae76e6bb0b247a092725e69fadb84e","313dd66aad0d3b6bd433729d84eab03ea031ea50","333abc43fabd2180effffc6fc1806646afecbf52","bbb3d0e5d053160b07a4d064b12975063626028d","83f3e43e9996fc20b96d0bf0375f335c66ae9282","ea994c3d9950ad47afe2c4d80c4de90d5afdd62a","7cff39fdc53ea260669657edf65d339461cb1d30","941afa776fc825a32e313a2ccb03ae113455910f","e10242d5261b05eb5960db8f329c3be2a057a92f","7efc96bdc2b8f04c36f8f9a26a80e61051432335","f05d6ebca3704f9177f430075dd62da344c57d92","d20f5c355b1778b84fa1590c8059ef20e83d0207","2f04bd92a49a20c1596a9f4efec9d359fa639e34","53314e2edf158ac66ae76fe3b92e5ce6a039ea3b","8334979f6bf8350aff6dcc824c38483800bf71d3","f380b111afd482c753f787e4e0e2d696a0c9ba23","70b7088308f6fca32915a87f42534d2ddc111de6","70d22907b77c49f6f9adfbb5a0f882e0a8fbf832","4841be620133b9a25471ab55ee2aa993a7b820cf","e06c92467ebaaaac398fc279deac4cbbee9a6ba9","38f48180e8dcff7f4362be0334b14d3d2e27ebf1","6e020bd226d0e9d3ee7e4edd3108852885e286d7"],"title":"Robust estimators of the concordance correlation coefficient.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100107651"}

This is also the case when clustering patient samples, and several integrative cluster procedures have been proposed. Common for these methodologies is the restriction to a joint cluster structure, equal in all data layers. We instead present a clustering extension of the Joint and Individual Variance Explained algorithm (JIVE), Joint and Individual Clustering (JIC), enabling the construction of both joint and data type-specific clusters simultaneously. The procedure builds on the connection between k-means clustering and principal component analysis, and hence, the number of clusters can be determined by the number of relevant principal components. The proposed procedure is compared with iCluster, a method restricted to only joint clusters, and simulations show that JIC is clearly advantageous when both individual and joint clusters are present. The procedure is illustrated using gene expression and miRNA levels measured in breast cancer tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The analysis suggests a division into three joint clusters common for both data types and two expression-specific clusters.","inCitations":["0f63b4532de1cf8a240a6d7218293f575f6e2ac8","9fb3193bb84ed26e9c6290e5468474b1d4beae31","509b9138c81c84f61af52d0d6624f81fa15c5a20","66ba35063c7e340400f825b158ccfb83368ae423","1df9134d61f16271cdd4537c446b2546d0c72a61","4dd6f04c6b1a21e152fcc70ea817671d70060f7d","9e1955f569252f2701f9f84997e18cd4bf43abb1","b67468305dc8d2ea4cd044d7861c5ce498d85998","58b0567009dd85815aac5c8edc2a555d6413ec8b","e0e37ce0b55916989dc19a7f70f478e533d7d58f","561b6892fcb41f9399072a362381e89baa26c53b","3e39bdb0eeaa30ed934f6359ed550be6e2e127b4","73e90eb0ceb15441e761a2335e2cdffe3054c0af","729d4e57fcf9c224341210d484ba359727beeea1"],"title":"Integrative clustering of high-dimensional data with joint and individual clusters.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw005"}

The distribution of batch means over time projects to a distribution of batch shelf lives on the x-axis. Assuming multivariate normality, shelf life is the ratio of correlated Gaussian variables. Using Hinkley ( 1969 ), we describe the relationship between quantiles of the distributions of batch shelf lives and batch means. Exploiting this relationship, a linear mixed model is used to estimate a target quantile of batch shelf lives to address the ICH objective.","inCitations":["1355acd132f6e50a214c4e1e31277e357097e377","a29a75598e1963cb94a86f7210980d8a0707f9c1"],"title":"On the distribution of batch shelf lives.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.790039"}

We use a linear mixed model, with a Box-Cox transformation of fetal weight values, and restricted cubic splines, in order to flexibly but parsimoniously model median fetal weight. We systematically compare our model to other proposed approaches. All proposed methods are shown to yield similar median estimates, as evidenced by overlapping pointwise confidence bands, except after 40 completed weeks, where our method seems to produce estimates more consistent with observed data. Sex-based stratification affects the estimates of the random effects variance-covariance structure, without significantly changing sex-specific fitted median values. We illustrate the benefits of including sex-gestational age interaction terms in the model over stratification. The comparison leads to the conclusion that the selection of a model for fetal weight for gestational age can be based on the specific goals and configuration of a given study without affecting the precision or value of median estimates for most gestational ages of interest.","inCitations":["801f7cc3931793a424e0f3da9879474b9d15fe6d","c5fe92c9180986bea79569444a652dce04c7905a","5563e46f8e72481356833e08e04cba880a8aa2de"],"title":"Modeling Fetal Weight for Gestational Age: A Comparison of a Flexible Multi-level Spline-based Model with Other Approaches","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1305"}

Geographical differences in dispensing rates of antibiotics are frequently analysed using statistical methods addressing the central tendency of the data. Yet, examining extreme quantiles may be of equal or greater interest if the problem relates to the extremes of consumption rates, as is the case for antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to investigate how geographic location (latitude) and municipality population size affect antibiotic consumption in Norway. We analysed all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions (n > 14 000 000) in Norway between 2004 and 2010 using quantile regression. Data were stratified by year, and we aggregated individual data to municipality, county, or latitudinal range. We specified the quantile regression models using directed acyclic graphs and selected the model based on Akaike information criteria. Yearly outpatient antibiotic consumption in Norway varied up to 10-fold at municipality level. We found geographical variation to depend on the number of inhabitants in a municipality and on latitude. These variables interacted, so that consumption declined with increasing latitude when municipality population sizes were small, but the effect of latitude diminished as the number of inhabitants increased. Aggregation to different levels of spatial resolution did not significantly affect our results. In Norway, outpatient antibiotic dispensing rates decreases with latitude at a rate contingent on municipality population size. Quantile regression analysis provides a flexible and powerful tool to address problems related to high, or low, dispensing rates.","inCitations":["5dbe3f337e9104155f5e79d6903adf1be9b4a04f"],"title":"Antibiotics to outpatients in Norway-Assessing effect of latitude and municipality population size using quantile regression in a cross-sectional study.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1831"}

A widely accepted design strategy in the study of how G-E relate to disease risks is the population-based case-control study (PBCCS). For simple random samples, semiparametric methods for testing G-E have been developed by Chatterjee and Carroll in 2005. The use of complex sampling in PBCCS that involve differential probabilities of sample selection of cases and controls and possibly cluster sampling is becoming more common. Two complexities, weighting for selection probabilities and intracluster correlation of observations, are induced by the complex sampling. We develop pseudo-semiparametric maximum likelihood estimators (pseudo-SPMLE) that apply to PBCCS with complex sampling. We study the finite sample performance of the pseudo-SPMLE using simulations and illustrate the pseudo-SPMLE with a US case-control study of kidney cancer.","inCitations":["f382a08ed6c23e7b77d4fb153ea23bc2192030eb","aa114c1318337c254eb55097ca5997c2a8de19ea"],"title":"Pseudo semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation exploiting gene environment independence for population-based case-control studies with complex samples.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs008"}

The theoretical linearity assumption between the logarithm of the proportion of nonresponding wells (s) and the cell concentration (N) (or dilution level) in LDA, based on the single-hit Poisson model, is often violated with observed data resulting in biased estimates of RCF. In this article, the Poisson assumption is modified by applying a mixture of Poisson and gamma distributions, resulting in a negative binomial assumption, which presents a better fit between s and N. In LDA for HZ prevention studies, binary responses (responder or non-responder wells) are measured repeatedly at different cell concentrations and over time. To account for the correlation between responses to varying dilution levels from individuals, and the correlation between repeated assays of individuals over time simultaneously, a binomial three-level nonlinear mixed-effects model is proposed. For parameter estimation, a maximum likelihood method is applied via adaptive Gaussian quadrature. There is a lack of non-Gaussian multilevel nonlinear mixed-effects software, which can execute such a complicated fit. In this article, an algorithm for the three-level nonlinear mixed-effects model, which can be inserted into the code in the SAS procedure NLMIXED, is suggested.","inCitations":["1879c88873b8c89aa377656e9487b8e8b3eba3cf"],"title":"Responder cell frequency estimation and binomial three-level nonlinear mixed effects model in limiting dilution assays.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200040855"}

Clustering occurs in many fields such as medical studies. For the problem, a number of methods have been proposed, but most of them apply only to clustered right-censored data. In reality, the failure time data is often interval-censored. That is, the failure times of interest are known only to lie in certain intervals. We propose an estimating equation-based approach for regression analysis of clustered interval-censored failure time data generated from the additive hazards model. A major advantage of the proposed method is that it does not involve the estimation of any baseline hazard function. Both asymptotic and finite sample properties of the proposed estimates of regression parameters are established and the method is illustrated by the data arising from a lymphatic filariasis study.","inCitations":["dbf06e6579a868decc7d2e90125c0400ab09df62","26c05f35cce78d0de25b3e12ef4d3909bbab9396","a74b9ff692e3967a5a581fbaca7b01dad3a997b9","419e52f8a8790d448b3c12f99db85dcdcf3d031a"],"title":"Regression analysis of clustered interval-censored failure time data with the additive hazards model.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2012.720256"}

An interesting recent approach takes the point of view that quantum effects arise solely from the interaction of finitely many classical \"worlds.\" The wave function is then recovered (as a secondary object) from observations of particles in these worlds, without knowing the world from which any particular observation originates. Hall, Deckert and Wiseman [Physical Review X 4 (2014) 041013] have introduced an explicit many-interacting-worlds harmonic oscillator model to provide support for this approach. In this note we provide a proof of their claim that the particle configuration is asymptotically Gaussian, thus matching the stationary ground-state solution of Schrödinger's equation when the number of worlds goes to infinity. We also construct a Markov chain based on resampling from the particle configuration and show that it converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, matching the time-dependent solution as well.","inCitations":["199c3597ce65335bf2c58464b9697dd341007585","66b8af9a67cf618a8b5de7604af1016267bf6e49","09b026a0eef869c093e70e8c8edf58965e0a3096","b7f23b77fb51f83d97c3f5c89de2dc5db466fe52","c3e40ac5fe116b307dfe6b07db38424e0f0c55f7"],"title":"Convergence of empirical distributions in an interpretation of quantum mechanics.","doi":"10.1214/15-AAP1154"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"In complex survey sampling, a fraction of a finite population is sampled. Often, the survey is conducted so that each subject in the population has a different probability of being selected into the sample. Further, many complex surveys involve stratification and clustering. For generalizability of the sample to the finite population, these features of the design are usually incorporated in the analysis. While the Wilcoxon rank sum test is commonly used to compare an ordinal variable in bivariate analyses, no simple extension of the Wilcoxon rank sum test has been proposed for complex survey data. With multinomial sampling of independent subjects, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistic equals the score test statistic for the group effect from a proportional odds cumulative logistic regression model for an ordinal outcome. Using this regression framework, for complex survey data, we formulate a similar proportional odds cumulative logistic regression model for the ordinal variable, and use an estimating equations score statistic for no group effect as an extension of the Wilcoxon test. The proposed method is applied to a complex survey designed to produce national estimates of the health care use, expenditures, sources of payment, and insurance coverage.","inCitations":["1108945f363d8d54e8720cf943f55f39352456aa","cab877b2b8820db4a8b74b08125f5c856db2ff19","d13112e4e04db138f5e4a10b3c1fa3f58239d576","26f92c8fc85850901d7742fb1a49f2eff47da804","8b0a1a635c53682392cdcde2cd22ab8569782a05","afe189931fdd7fc732cff6af1dc1c643b0070c81","fca30ae5d47f8d3420b1bebba62e7fdca6386946","27d9a0ca418b227dde58567a1c8c395b64daca61","0d587e91d688800f5a58d64783ff599bf36dc143","cc9b798667ff36dbad8c820d80c72559c53a9c18","0a0ed699d77b5eb671a412e3f1a14584b8b67978","078e1ffdc601ca4ffaaedaa7393b8b2f1c8e1491","1dff1984e4f65862046fcac16c620a9e3d1bfd56","1631c48799131c26c6577c57cce55e933da2999b","1379907d2f3199f14d0a460189699d31c445975a","2621447e227cde8540aed477636b100a66eb198e","1c446ffe70636ad0c66f9af11569fd7768b54f01","966690bf1ee49b1f04493425e5747561b8b67b0b","a680700c5abf9efca7bf2d615b40604d4cd8f902","641330c1cde8228c041ce22674d367abb8c25b3b","1217f90b521070220ad0b6b4cb2afb4d7be88b0c","1dc9f77490336ccf5678aa6c171de1677931960d","ae508493a709f5dbbd22edd3ecacea083a3d1c42"],"title":"An extension of the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test for complex sample survey data.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2011.01028.x"}

Although the regularized estimation procedure produces a more stable point estimate, it remains challenging to provide an interval estimator or an analytic variance estimator for the associated point estimate. Based on the sandwich formula, the current variance estimator provides a simple approximation, but its finite sample performance is not entirely satisfactory. Besides, the sandwich formula can only provide variance estimates for the non-zero coefficients. In this article, we present a generic description for the perturbation method and then introduce a computation algorithm using the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our method can better approximate the limiting distribution of the adaptive LASSO estimator and produces more accurate inference compared with the sandwich formula. The simulation results also indicate the possibility of extending the applications to the adaptive elastic-net penalty. We further demonstrate our method using data from a phase III clinical trial in prostate cancer.","inCitations":["51f64a7a0e8794e9a3428543c3f12641c87a6849","9ef99c0bf1fe8b296be4128bf63798b9b6fce3a8"],"title":"A Simple Method for Deriving the Confidence Regions for the Penalized Cox's Model via the Minimand Perturbation.","doi":"10.1080/03610926.2015.1085568"}

This approach extends what has been described for generalized linear models and nonlinear population pharmacokinetic models that involve only binary covariates to more complex nonlinear population pharmacokinetic models. The structural nonlinear model is linearized around the random effects to obtain the marginal model and the hypothesis testing involving model parameters is based on Wald's test. This approach provides an efficient and fast method for calculating sample size for hypothesis testing in population pharmacokinetic models. The approach can also handle different design problems such as unequal allocation of subjects to groups and unbalanced sampling times between and within groups.

Current penalized selection methods that are used to identify biomarker panels for classification in high-dimensional data, however, often result in highly complex panels that need careful pruning for practical use. In the framework of regularization methods, a penalty that is a weighted sum of the L1 and L0 norm has been proposed to account for the complexity of the resulting model. In practice, the limitation of this penalty is that the objective function is non-convex, non-smooth, the optimization is computationally intensive and the application to high-dimensional settings is challenging. In this paper, we propose a stepwise forward variable selection method which combines the L0 with L1 or L2 norms. The penalized likelihood criterion that is used in the stepwise selection procedure results in more parsimonious models, keeping only the most relevant features. Simulation results and a real application show that our approach exhibits a comparable performance with common selection methods with respect to the prediction performance while minimizing the number of variables in the selected model resulting in a more parsimonious model as desired.","inCitations":["8f9f3c99f742c878f28a3170b08c9dcbc5266ef6"],"title":"Model selection based on combined penalties for biomarker identification.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1378662"}

(2007) compared survival probabilities at a fixed time point by studying a number of tests based on some transformations of the Kaplan-Meier estimators of the survival function. However, to compare the survival probabilities at a fixed time point for paired right-censored data or clustered right-censored data, their approach would need to be modified. In this paper, we extend the statistics to accommodate the possible within-paired correlation and within-clustered correlation, respectively. We use simulation studies to present comparative results.

There are formulae and tables for estimating sample sizes required to detect the main effects of treatment and the treatment by time interactions for those models. A formula is proposed to estimate the sample size required to detect an interaction between two binary variables in a factorial design with repeated measures of a continuous outcome. The formula is based, in part, on the fact that the variance of an interaction is fourfold that of the main effect. A simulation study examines the statistical power associated with the resulting sample sizes in a mixed-effects linear regression model with a random intercept. The simulation varies the magnitude (Δ) of the standardized main effects and interactions, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ρ ), and the number (k) of repeated measures within-subject. The results of the simulation study verify that the sample size required to detect a 2 × 2 interaction in a mixed-effects linear regression model is fourfold that to detect a main effect of the same magnitude.","inCitations":["c121d8d35ec167b2e33a82b4e2057a63bc64e510","4652a403335c7f7a0dd681b690853d80e5c45733","15bb697397a36047ed5ddaac6d5e926f9f3578dc","94813ed378f5614d39f77e4cb9f1ce7ba3454e83","d58b254683411a1da4d2ba1722e615df879bf11e","0d04db9b8ca45d569bf61c9fa72f9e3e6c6ada01","1ad7cadf029b72d830739706021070f2ea58cc5e","142647698c686aa08ef1e468b55726803444771e","23f1b9343c4e124e5476e47a55f4a97b8f53858b","e2e79f2866a883ff604f493bf6fefea3a4f6dd2e","b2cfab74b289d07b165a3a8896b3a1a792c4444a","3573f1a7afef99f712b99360e88a981bd50f7088","9cdae0567d11619811482cecfd27f4e61c974d89","560161445a12381b3680725c21959705dda74630","d62798f8e5671b7e0c2fc73db363c009dfab2122","8883fda3be29881b261a7d241cdefe2473eaa1b9","57cfb395e53dfd9dcd4a4dcf44e9c4641217445a","2457986b92fe714312ab80dfa72e6629b86fa0c8","2d00a2e4b39c6daec453f98ae7aa2184349c00ad","f2bf856dfdb5f5e3913b9fc130eb9a97def4fbfa","00703ad5a0f2f9eadb3179c2235b538f461e1543","2294a5a2d901d08546bead15fca841c208c315af","1b0944d65b1673d0ff714b994da989e927fcf079","4815d7b9b972542a7bd017f4285ec49e16f93c01","12889acdec67ec57790eeb236bea861086d9b584","c1e411520c8cee1849763740cadb1656bffee797","b82b8efaabe1e7302125540eaee02392c33fd458","fbe3696bac0954d3f36142e172e3a466ff9a2df4","160c2b05efdd5ef70c218aeb759677a4471eaa84","12e5f85472c7aeec80ba9c55d49e644213c15673","e0dce275cb8d54f45c8063287eb719ee2d0b71a4","8d62f571ae231a8618d817b20d651c4729b3c83e","1e536691a0d50729f7d06e0c3ccc858545d3cf5a"],"title":"Sample sizes required to detect interactions between two binary fixed-effects in a mixed-effects linear regression model","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.06.010"}

The commonly used classical methods including model-dependent and model-independent approaches are reviewed. Most methods encountered the difficulties of no well-defined equivalence limits and the correlation between consecutive time points. Several methods have been proposed to account for these difficulties, e.g., the method of repeated measures (1) and the multivariate analysis approach (2). These methods, however, are sensitive to the selection of time points and complex covariance error structure. In this paper, we propose equivalence limits for similarity based on the amount of dissolved active ingredient as specified in the United States Pharmacopeia and National Formulary (USP/NF). Accordingly, we proposed a time series approach, which accounts for correlation between dissolution results at different time points. The proposed model is shown to be useful in assessment of similarity between dissolution profiles of two drug products. An example concerning dissolution testing of two lots of a drug product is used to illustrate the proposed equivalence limits and statistical methodology.","inCitations":["2c597516a683d406c0aa58b080b0d8cb042d7eb9","07826dcad0be7b5df233d94240da54b5a404e712","bf8b7a9c58518ca5f2773f491868817480a0f048","72a5c30313d3241443737010ebb9ba42dc0dc5a2","137d03045a4f611e0f0a2e2bd0b3d7232c33b2cf","914e22c2d83a99337c2aa7dc21f02db1716ace6b","88fe66bcc1773849dbfeed29edbf8b50cf5a9b8a","f7cefb7bdc24aa2854a1a7cf81a0d196e5fd28fc","9ba600ac0b019c3f331dccf87b409bd81f978019","ed6d258750df8544a2767e2c17ba9c0e489276cf","7d1b7a3655d0c609a7878f844ee988832ff5c96c","e4ae0506df18710004ea5bbde5a0fa99e251417a","488c022bb78e55b734ad6628fc59eb34ed484e1a","a2311f1ec66b832f711e357ebcf82d68bd0115e1","8cc99999ef01cfbd406ca606a6ff1479da730ac9","f9976f5d0d88b5abf232d04ffa95aa8a48923dac","05f928031442acb6c10db9b44d84a5fb9dac07c4","a560c91bb795f21dc9a21e4116e30511e8a6ac45","0fef1ec5b963b35e9927af3b0f90139d657c0923","a7a6a2c9b6db35dc5c9c99c99b96e0d75fe15317","428c887affe1c126d842e3f07ae2b5d501803f8a","101e262b038b2721a9d617a5014f05bedb0b223d","7dee25c46ac894b1b2b600f2114c179fecdedd7b"],"title":"Statistical comparison between dissolution profiles of drug products.","doi":"10.1080/10543409708835184"}

The evolution is often characterized by a 2-phase degradation process, that is, a normal phase followed by a pathological degradation phase preceding the disease diagnosis. We propose a joint multistate model with latent state for the joint modeling of repeated measures of a quantitative marker, time-to-illness and time-to-death. Using data from the PAQUID cohort on cognitive aging, we jointly studied cognitive decline, dementia risk, and death risk. We estimated the mean evolution of cognitive scores given age at dementia for subjects alive and demented, the mean evolution of cognitive scores for subjects alive and nondemented, in addition to age at acceleration of cognitive decline and duration of the pre-dementia phase.","inCitations":["c397bcb35dafeb520033c9eb827572be08c88082","eb23cf85e45e1d3dd6e0c8a7fb6d161e5dcf17c5","50d75c5fe8ccce013ecb91f4840648221c997c0c","06f7ba0ec46415243fd5087cb56757008fa00914","feab433fc3209afd55c49663b18ac1b5e641be60","ccc546c5d345eacc27e1f9614da0a77b01e8d7c9","d2e1d23e1a99a11d8bcc61383e3175421e63034e","5ea3df6e12ece9b3af281be06f36291ff08829ec","a80e106f284d2d0a4856bd0584e816ec89e21862","eed6ea2ede665cc65bf20693ef6ba0614ac7b33b","e38f89db7066bc0ea4a9d2c3eff73d7f6effdc5b","b6e99fbd273fd570411180fed1c35384cfce2ba6","49f615b062c94cd30668b20332fa5cc7bf4a31c8","c358dc2b14e0e233a23aaf8c3c0904c5a0cf7594","f446fadc6c749c6111338f16b58ca1c3e95dbded","408a3ac99103228683d5e653a4a5be680190ab50"],"title":"Joint model with latent state for longitudinal and multistate data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr003"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Meta-analysis combining multiple transcriptomic studies increases statistical power and accuracy in detecting differentially expressed genes. As the next-generation sequencing experiments become mature and affordable, increasing number of RNA-seq datasets are available in the public domain. The count-data based technology provides better experimental accuracy, reproducibility and ability to detect low-expressed genes. A naive approach to combine multiple RNA-seq studies is to apply differential analysis tools such as edgeR and DESeq to each study and then combine the summary statistics of p-values or effect sizes by conventional meta-analysis methods. Such a two-stage approach loses statistical power, especially for genes with short length or low expression abundance. In this paper, we propose a full Bayesian hierarchical model (namely, BayesMetaSeq) for RNA-seq meta-analysis by modelling count data, integrating information across genes and across studies, and modelling potentially heterogeneous differential signals across studies via latent variables. A Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) prior is further applied on the latent variables to provide categorization of detected biomarkers according to their differential expression patterns across studies, facilitating improved interpretation and biological hypothesis generation. Simulations and a real application on multi-brain-region HIV-1 transgenic rats demonstrate improved sensitivity, accuracy and biological findings of the proposed method.","inCitations":["872a8d32b42c1e2acbbf659ecb6e6283094f9d48","0899202aa8d5e706af4cd6d74f6e944949b0d9bc","44ed27d75ee3e1d047c9fa0c5ee9d9344f975518"],"title":"Biomarker detection and categorization in ribonucleic acid sequencing meta-analysis using Bayesian hierarchical models.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12199"}
