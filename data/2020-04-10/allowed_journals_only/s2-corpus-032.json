Concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) is one of the most popular scaled indices reported in evaluation of agreement. Robust methods for CCC estimation currently present an important statistical challenge. Here, we propose a novel Bayesian method of robust estimation of CCC based on multivariate Student's t-distribution and compare it with its alternatives. Furthermore, we extend the method to practically relevant settings, enabling incorporation of confounding covariates and replications. The superiority of the new approach is demonstrated using simulation as well as real datasets from biomarker application in electroencephalography (EEG). This biomarker is relevant in neuroscience for development of treatments for insomnia.","inCitations":["7ba28b22bf34d83d7a66182011d8594915c1d6b6","ddfc9e436a219112a832f7ed9183ce4cf72dfc9c","f5a3a1127c31db276ee1648e28c60de9465c61c9","bbb3d0e5d053160b07a4d064b12975063626028d"],"title":"A robust bayesian estimate of the concordance correlation coefficient.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.920342"}

Although clinical responses are usually rare in phase I cancer trials, molecularly targeted therapy may make clinical responses more likely. In addition, biological responses may be common. Thus responses may be frequent enough to help decide how aggressive a phase I escalation should be. The model assumes that response and toxicity events happen depending on respective dose thresholds for the individual, assuming that the thresholds jointly follow a bivariate log-normal distribution or a mixture. The design utilizes prior information about the population threshold distribution as well as accumulated data. The next dose is assigned to maximize a patient-oriented expected utility integrated over the current posterior distribution. The design is evaluated through simulation with population parameters equaling estimates from early Gleevec trials. This exercise provides evidence for the value of the use of the proposed design for future clinical trials.","inCitations":["6fbbd94f127b6a316afa2e43442dce64b02f9448","e52b774d3cb7ffcb5dbbb7d8fd12e4a5e0724092","28c64f6b165c349ecead6c57c08d14556cf6842d"],"title":"Adaptive Bayesian design for phase I dose-finding trials using a joint model of response and toxicity.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903280613"}

The FDA, however, does not indicate that two generic copies of the same innovative drug can be used interchangeably, even though they have been shown to be bioequivalent to the same innovative drug product. As more and more generic drug products become available in the market place, it is a concern whether these approved generic drug products have the same quality and safety/efficacy and hence can be used interchangeably. To address the issue of drug interchangeability, several criteria such as individual bioequivalence criterion, a criterion based on the variability due to subject-by-drug interaction, and a scaled criterion for drug interchangeability (SCDI) have been proposed in the literature. In this article, the performances of these criteria, including a newly proposed reversed average bioequivalence criterion, are studied under a 2x4 replicated crossover design in terms of the percentage of passing at the best and worst possible scenarios of similarity. The goal of this paper is to investigate the interchangeability in terms of switchability between a generic (test) drug product and an originator (reference) drug product.","inCitations":["0274691f678f4bd3810e415bf68524248d76bd0b","355a10ad50ea30684e467390bc2bb4157c861dbb"],"title":"Assessing bioequivalence and drug interchangeability.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1265537"}

Often, especially in observational studies, longitudinal trends are studied after correction for many potentially important baseline differences between subjects. We show that, in the context of linear mixed models, inference for longitudinal trends is in general biased if a wrong model for the baseline characteristics is used. However, we will argue that this bias is small in most practical situations and completely vanishes in the special case of a growth curve model for complete balanced data. In the latter case, inference for longitudinal trends is completely independent of additional baseline covariates that might have been omitted from the model.","inCitations":["9f471819abcf97f8179b369ad8c3959c2bdbba27","ee3dafc58399c8b52c79b4fd10efaaea8e6188f8","324b5e85eef70d016c3845fc3ae9638e7eb51b41","707fb561f60ebf6f9228852f51df812440abecc5","a3065ca20a753b79a64ffc2bebc1a5f2a5bc5b39","4414c36d504e1fbc581892d7b1d636584053b40f","f9cf3f29ae8086ad5f1be464b563ad49bb37f4b8"],"title":"The effect of miss-specified baseline characteristics on inference for longitudinal trends in linear mixed models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm004"}

For example, the same rating scale may be used to assess the symptom severity of the same patients by multiple physicians, or the same outcome may be measured repeatedly over time in the same patients. Reliability can be estimated in various ways, for example, using the classical Pearson correlation or the intra-class correlation in clustered data. However, contemporary data often have a complex structure that goes well beyond the restrictive assumptions that are needed with the more conventional methods to estimate reliability. In the current paper, we propose a general and flexible modeling approach that allows for the derivation of reliability estimates, standard errors, and confidence intervals - appropriately taking hierarchies and covariates in the data into account. Our methodology is developed for continuous outcomes together with covariates of an arbitrary type. The methodology is illustrated in a case study, and a Web Appendix is provided which details the computations using the R package CorrMixed and the SAS software.

This permits simple explicit expressions for the expectation of the score statistic, which we use to compare the power of different strategies.

Thus, unless there is strong and consistent evidence for a departure from log-normality, the parametric statistical analysis of common noncompartmental pharmacokinetic variables should be carried out after a priori log transformation.","inCitations":["d503d52109f11b8f05b34b4605ee87c817d8573c","d12d980ab30453ce19910cd69d743ea9592f3ca8","5732c706fcbc36d2a6705144dd52f5a3f9e9975b","4d56a9764749356a0c650c46049dcea7c30c86cd","7aebb75ca1656b3e497de161770b4a26b1d41188","9f2a2d95bd95c78a93f9e7907b2256c48d2c6749","4bd9c7dce28c67af6455068c3077231afd161d99","0ab028f5ba665016aa08fa934bbbce680e7af8e6","cfe87d91ec337a801235b18de28b47d18428107a","360467945e02ba2b4c784267f2c5693ef4649676","8137bf6d3a10030762b1324bc3e8e4a375db5d7e","8a4bf9cef2c0368f7fb3223d78ee17157c6e3796","2e0037a5e527c58880654110e81ff3073a75a382","872e10d615c8b5f22c05b174de2a92f60845c7b5","bb2881c436353e11c4283fb90c7e4de0d1f723c7","a22fa17eaebbd00a92deff36e33c8f56b8f9cb5d","414240104517d9b0cc9d02576d8d10dc2d00e746","a802e3ee37ff42e5585e847c21e32678a71f4a22","466228424a13c97294083bef4be6473c33d7d095","2dbcd1843aac76167eea1ba88de5ceba3a7ca4e4","5a2486c260792f6472351b14733aa2cf6794a138","422e55250b9b79e4dd49a0465cf9b6ee7f193159","4e382b083f21c02cf7ca6d3d62e0fd252a493988","32007647fc1f2906f7ca8bd5093741e6ddb7c1ac","1652fcb7f3165bec7075d4ef71a1cf3518d7e580","4224ead4bc50796993c9528ec7e2aa625b87617e","cfdbd03b2948306ecf8b38a9a1d4889b514f89c4","c9930d79bde58f4674cffef95665a48d297693d4","3051975d3ae5ef8b582015f9fb917352a3992381","1017864aa1af2cdf81de0aa9fd9703bed7b79929","fd93f1e0094b79908d563330d6663cb0286a6f13","764376793281a9ced324e9499ad528618a896f34","52d4e98cd1f546512173f5d90d4b5e6eb442b4fc","539f7ffe93d2543e0e23233142dfde8c1d7e935e","d49f9ec8be916bb04b12e5a30924cd7ae62bb843","113a9891449d8521930ce316a10b363749cd8477","f176b8a94797f9408c5e33dcc016ed2219e62915","c317170eef4d179776e01e8013cdf008d34885e7","497abdd44b9e0d519d78c6f1b07e9461fe560de2","e8fc42d6c6bd02c5bf240d7b8b38790c994d3cd6","de4b3026af543a6a3e703485c3d504d130d188ac","3294b9c83ae44877c3ca42d4fea9ded4e894004a","21045a0dade1559dff02cf4b4c1a83673554f01b","c43e6ad39204de19328ebd4d8631226b23a9ae44","740618e2fa58412276a1c76c1e8e86920376f5e8","0f321e94f23df5528278908e2dd695e4b8c7a8b5","62ca62c76f66820e88dee3326526ec2628f925fe","bbf9473d54c734f450fe97f6bc1b765a26cd4486","fd85d28f659b03426b2f22922f4fe3df3c989249","8a70fbdf7cc9f5f548f29e3e511e17a7a7f09949","8ad28db45d29fe4ef7c31870f2f56179859b07a6","5280a5b3a1799f3c0d646356003f5ef8b7e3df08","5852c26cae57850327bad38d28ebe26088f40d68","b3325f9be0df6ac33e1036e2c409d7ee29ab0c69","7b65268c0540d1fdf6370cc77ff1583dcc006426","e3161ffb08b9be5e3bad2b1a5e934b559b429d8e","267eae1b59285a4d1ccb297d024a3eb616064b25","13fb1476f6c236527e1a61b4fdb1ba03dc95599d","0689fee0c8c8c92faa2336b14342c4f4a85fabaa"],"title":"Common noncompartmental pharmacokinetic variables: are they normally or log-normally distributed?","doi":"10.1080/10543409708835177"}

For classifying a patient into the non-diseased or diseased group, an optimal cut-point of a continuous biomarker is desirable. Youden's index (J), defined as the maximum vertical distance between the ROC curve and the diagonal line, serves as another global measure of overall diagnostic accuracy and can be used in choosing an optimal cut-point. The proposed approach is to make use of a generalized approach to estimate the confidence intervals of the Youden index and its corresponding optimal cut-point. Simulation results are provided for comparing the coverage probabilities of the confidence intervals based on the proposed method with those based on the large sample method and the parametric bootstrap method.

The basic approach involved obtaining multiple contrasts for different problem-related contrast definitions. For all approaches, definitions of relevance margins for superiority or noninferiority are needed. Because consensus on margins only exists for selected therapeutic areas and the definition of absolute thresholds may be difficult, simultaneous confidence intervals for ratio to placebo were also used. All approaches are demonstrated in an example-based manner using the R-packages multcomp (difference), for hypotheses based on difference, and mratios (ratio), for hypotheses based on ratios.","inCitations":["42f96e3dd386d2e34d3c694ab13015f124a09222","a766bd9dc0bbe4f80de8e0291e8b4a49b4604d6e","779d5d9136b86fad9055810a221ccc9bc3373ed7","a62f630592f04967a6c9960722a83c9d0e8182ea","25a63948cdeac2ac78fda3f4cec2231aa85c3cba","a0b55f21428cc546b76d65fa605d1df6ac12a06e"],"title":"Multiple comparisons and multiple contrasts in randomized dose-response trials--confidence interval oriented approaches.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600860576"}

In longitudinal settings, time-varying or post-intervention effect modifiers are also of interest. In this work, we investigate the robust and efficient estimation of the Counterfactual-History-Adjusted Marginal Structural Model (van der Laan MJ, Petersen M. Statistical learning of origin-specific statically optimal individualized treatment rules. Int J Biostat. 2007;3), which models the conditional intervention-specific mean outcome given a counterfactual modifier history in an ideal experiment. We establish the semiparametric efficiency theory for these models, and present a substitution-based, semiparametric efficient and doubly robust estimator using the targeted maximum likelihood estimation methodology (TMLE, e.g. van der Laan MJ, Rubin DB. Targeted maximum likelihood learning. Int J Biostat. 2006;2, van der Laan MJ, Rose S. Targeted learning: causal inference for observational and experimental data, 1st ed. Springer Series in Statistics. Springer, 2011). To facilitate implementation in applications where the effect modifier is high dimensional, our third contribution is a projected influence function (and the corresponding projected TMLE estimator), which retains most of the robustness of its efficient peer and can be easily implemented in applications where the use of the efficient influence function becomes taxing. We compare the projected TMLE estimator with an Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighted estimator (e.g. Robins JM. Marginal structural models. In: Proceedings of the American Statistical Association. Section on Bayesian Statistical Science, 1-10. 1997a, Hernan MA, Brumback B, Robins JM. Marginal structural models to estimate the causal effect of zidovudine on the survival of HIV-positive men. Epidemiology. 2000;11:561–570), and a non-targeted G-computation estimator (Robins JM. A new approach to causal inference in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods - application to control of the healthy worker survivor effect. Math Modell. 1986;7:1393–1512.). The comparative performance of these estimators is assessed in a simulation study. The use of the projected TMLE estimator is illustrated in a secondary data analysis for the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial where effect modifiers are subject to missing at random.","inCitations":["279602641366cca85275ea6ae9ccdb98f6aadab2","8dee1bf96dfdc46e5ae8b887b2dbabff82de73f6","3646070b1fb650456afd52a5cb780a882b7fb78a"],"title":"Marginal Structural Models with Counterfactual Effect Modifiers","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2018-0039"}

The biological focus is on improving understanding of transcriptional responses of tumors to changes in the pH level of the cellular microenvironment. The statistical focus is on connecting experimentally defined biomarkers of such responses to clinical outcome in observational studies of breast cancer patients. Our analysis exemplifies a general strategy for accomplishing this kind of integration across contexts. The statistical methodologies employed here draw heavily on Bayesian sparse factor models for identifying, modularizing and correlating with clinical outcome these signatures of aggregate changes in gene expression. By projecting patterns of biological response linked to specific experimental interventions into observational studies where such responses may be evidenced via variation in gene expression across samples, we are able to define biomarkers of clinically relevant physiological states and outcomes that are rooted in the biology of the original experiment. Through this approach we identify microenvironment-related prognostic factors capable of predicting long term survival in two independent breast cancer datasets. These results suggest possible directions for future laboratory studies, as well as indicate the potential for therapeutic advances though targeted disruption of specific pathway components.","inCitations":["2ed7738c2e167cc4c015a20baa1316f600b63e77","3776bb95ffb32ad5e67cf720f2e23fad6fb01270","bee0a5503453b83fed88385aacdec08b207d10aa","b48268b667bf10ce4556a0a53d81dca77dff6613","5efcb26ddfe60ff010f947d430baae0ce06b8aeb","fb0caf5e5e2dc15cea1c61cda302209e7a0b9841","3d30fdaed9ddb6cd8d6212db3a76e550e4a8e367","8ed2429e66b0f01e147a2dba6955fa53edc77159"],"title":"An Integrative Analysis of Cancer Gene Expression Studies Using Bayesian Latent Factor Modeling.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS261"}

We propose extending the standard definitions of the predictive values to accommodate prognostic factors that are measured on a continuous scale and suggest a corresponding graphical method to summarize predictive accuracy. Drawing on the work of Leisenring et al. we make use of a marginal regression framework and discuss methods for estimating these predictive value functions and their differences within this framework. The methods presented in this paper have the potential to be useful in a number of areas including the design of clinical trials and health policy analysis.","inCitations":["3a195ee4041d6ab2cd43b08e5604d0afe6e481fd","9e9d198f066c193efd599790154d4ef794808246","1cde5d12b8744ac5f29fe849e547379602582b85","854e5a8a1d924e33947e803c5f9fb3431ad2eba1","73ba4f9875116815ee14a68421e852809d7ae2db","3f21c4aa6b0579fd237ea59935969a02de191678","df5257733164042aea61860c2ab38c4e2b945cd3","a76e26aabd3b7442d674a83e2bfac4fe898414b7","918d90ab7cc883f664648558913670034fa89b9f","1400609bd54acf17ebf1e4c1287dfbe7d149eefa","3825a9aa1d8afe27de348a280932abad3ad4727b","9a5f28e2465e227f16ce564609ae23efa905de64","4e104140aded689f4bcd30d9046f621aafea7211","575eeba99063323410629cc68d5af391db0b955c","b4122df06e5e9085d758f6cd564339d6e9856325","8a50ab64b0c3d10abb5b2b55f9c641cf527307ff","d763d34b8c8b87fe3050ce574385f275685c7523","d43b4ddc2edd9749a99e7591508cd8515ddcd999","835893fb7900a57babab4c0e2ddd838b885d9973","d6a2f3955cb5a70c2f66aa1b33f629b6a308182d","cdcbd6185099749ddc49279d31c1e1fa2519a9f9","7d2550cb2cb27023b99539dd65445ee421d30165","d64827fee0164fb931613826244571523b687232","0af137ea3d2262a292791730e8241f4715dac0f3","948a12db688e884414251664b0559e61d0e61b04","7460b690cfcedd357556e1f9531a5184c086cff1","f5b49d26e54ef3d5331deab7c0e0db87d10d7eab","bea55f0082266356be6fb0a2f3d63d2d1bee2440"],"title":"Quantifying and comparing the predictive accuracy of continuous prognostic factors for binary outcomes.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.1.113"}

For drug products, specifications usually consist of test methods and acceptance criteria for assay, impurities, pH, dissolution, moisture, and microbial limits, depending on the dosage forms. They are usually proposed by the manufacturers and subject to the regulatory approval for use. When the acceptance criteria in product specifications cannot be pre-defined based on prior knowledge, the conventional approach is to use data from a limited number of clinical batches during the clinical development phases. Often in time, such acceptance criterion is set as an interval bounded by the sample mean plus and minus two to four standard deviations. This interval may be revised with the accumulated data collected from released batches after drug approval. In this article, we describe and discuss the statistical issues of commonly used approaches in setting or revising specifications (usually tighten the limits), including reference interval, (Min, Max) method, tolerance interval, and confidence limit of percentiles. We also compare their performance in terms of the interval width and the intended coverage. Based on our study results and review experiences, we make some recommendations on how to select the appropriate statistical methods in setting product specifications to better ensure the product quality.","inCitations":["a6b1eacb48dc02daad50dfd568d2f4a11b8a34ac","940d51fd4f7cfc65adab8dc260df8fcfd9e1a009","fbcdcaf85f8c9bfb9327e5cfabea902e5c3c9521","04b50a8d6290a5c4c0eff069516ec9cf947521ff"],"title":"Statistical considerations in setting product specifications.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.972511"}

The relative bioavailability in terms of the rate and extent of drug absorption is considered predictive of clinical outcomes. In 1984, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was authorized to approve generic drug products under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act based on evidence of average bioequivalence in drug absorption through the conduct of bioavailability and bioequivalence studies. This article provides an overview (from an American point of view) of definition of bioavailability and bioequivalence, Fundamental Bioequivalence Assumption, regulatory requirements, and process for bioequivalence assessment of generic drug products. Basic considerations including criteria, study design, power analysis for sample size determination, and the conduct of bioequivalence trial, and statistical methods are provided. Practical issues such as one size-fits-all criterion, drug interchangeability and scaled average criteria for assessment of highly variable drug products are also discussed.","inCitations":["f426907bfcc18ac0e3b30d4f8e53806dac4c14c8","335959f380585ab2f06a39338ed0a9cf9495484f","d3e0c099e142fa2570d2aa884cec7001c630a59c","2b50d8dc7b6ba990a81c69f2d08b19c17b013442","4e15c4692ef952f4c9e4e1aa468d236144307d43","432c26de27fa72ad46a307e9977d91bb5c8cafbf","6d838d1dfc805e5eb3c38b49bf522f3fbcf36fd8","e34d25b52cbcb3cb257782bc604c8a98f3ef7071","f1d6c3ef2efd082d425e0bf75332030e128021ec","5531cad2bd42c9ca8004e09c8c3407812e1ff6e3","0b7bbbe02b3ec27d8300439202dbfe11e31e52a2","427e6767470e33f31412568513eec5282bcb1d79","272c652928c9a60b8b4931f697c565bd4f252a23","8d9d7a687da6ab1219beb6cd241822464a2c613f","2174453ad254451a906d6338c40c23f2e4b5a1f5","87eb1915fe251c01e1a704f04c1ce748f809d963","1b7159b90395a482f633adee868c15aa8139c4d7","a3a01e47fb3042d466ff1c694801215b357c36b2","6957b2d26c96a4e124053979b58200eca766e3e0","6a615cc7b57603e154c8e9d1eacfa947f8bd0e66"],"title":"Bioavailability and Bioequivalence in Drug Development.","doi":"10.1002/wics.1310"}

All of the computations for the first-order approximations can be easily done using Markov chain Monte Carlo samples from the posterior distribution based on the full data.

We describe a classical regression framework for conducting mediation analyses in which estimates of causal mediation effects and their variance are obtained from the fit of a single regression model. The vector of changes in exposure pathway coefficients, which we named the essential mediation components (EMCs), is used to estimate standard causal mediation effects. Because these effects are often simple functions of the EMCs, an analytical expression for their model-based variance follows directly. Given this formula, it is instructive to revisit the performance of routinely used variance approximations (e.g., delta method and resampling methods). Requiring the fit of only one model reduces the computation time required for complex mediation analyses and permits the use of a rich suite of regression tools that are not easily implemented on a system of three equations, as would be required in the Baron-Kenny framework. Using data from the BRAIN-ICU study, we provide examples to illustrate the advantages of this framework and compare it with the existing approaches.","inCitations":["31fc607040dec29876d87db289de17663a1ebfc8"],"title":"A classical regression framework for mediation analysis: fitting one model to estimate mediation effects","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx054"}

If the goal is estimation of the parameters of a marginal complete-data model for the outcome, biased inference will result from fitting the model of interest with only uncensored subjects. For example, investigators are interested in estimating a prognostic model for clinical events in HIV-positive patients, under the counterfactual scenario in which everyone remained on ART (when in reality, only a subset had). Inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) is a popular method that relies on correct estimation of the probability of censoring to produce consistent estimation, but is an inefficient estimator in its standard form. We introduce sequentially augmented regression (SAR), an adaptation of the Bang and Robins (2005. Doubly robust estimation in missing data and causal inference models. Biometrics 61, 962-972.) method to estimate a complete-data prediction model, adjusting for longitudinal missing at random censoring. In addition, we propose a closely related non-parametric approach using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE; van der Laan and Rubin, 2006. Targeted maximum likelihood learning. The International Journal of Biostatistics 2 (1), Article 11). We compare IPCW, SAR, and TMLE (implemented parametrically and with Super Learner) through simulation and the above-mentioned case study.","inCitations":["371e53ed0c775d757b0552367c36f0d1c1a96755","55e833475a41b5097016a3d1a627be430dade78d","ae080f86fed62acc0f68dec92e9d33ac442005de","56c27592ccbbdea7d3670c37ccb890841ca60dff"],"title":"Double robust and efficient estimation of a prognostic model for events in the presence of dependent censoring.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv028"}

Renyi's measure is referred to as the information divergence of order γ (γ ≠ 1) between two distributions. In the limiting case γ → 1, Renyi's measure becomes Kullback-Leibler divergence. In our case, the distributions correspond to the baseline and one possibly due to a covariate effect. Our proposed statistics are simple transformations of the parameter vector in the Cox proportional hazards model, and are compared with the Wald, likelihood ratio and Score tests that are widely used in practice. Finally, the methods are illustrated using two real-life data sets.","inCitations":["d39196386f0e0b0253813c37d2219935378ace39","35db47acbb8e550edfa2197cde32d596c45ec303","304436c521b227836d2198856c50c67513419e03"],"title":"Testing for Covariate Effect in the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model.","doi":"10.1080/03610920802536958"}

Statistical analysis of neurophysiological recordings, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), facilitates the understanding and diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Standard statistical methods, however, do not account for topological features embedded in EEG signals. In the current study, we propose a persistent homology (PH) procedure to analyze single-trial EEG signals. The procedure denoises signals with a weighted Fourier series (WFS), and tests for topological difference between the denoised signals with a permutation test based on their PH features persistence landscapes (PL). Simulation studies show that the test effectively identifies topological difference and invariance between two signals. In an application to a single-trial multichannel seizure EEG dataset, our proposed PH procedure was able to identify the left temporal region to consistently show topological invariance, suggesting that the PH features of the Fourier decomposition during seizure is similar to the process before seizure. This finding is important because it could not be identified from a mere visual inspection of the EEG data and was in fact missed by earlier analyses of the same dataset.","inCitations":["90379ae7a43f5d0355ecf79690e1494ac9dba819","d545ea566edbc4929df21908a3b3ebdc3e549a80","dec849a7e644fe184151fd266ee6fdde2b4d917f","caf10da7e032a35ccc827cb3b7ab6ca2b11d1555","c62ea1bdd5b763516db7954009c194b918679e29","54bf0a67ca801a516c9137f4cc0f69df3485b01d","007b56375aa24afdde0c2a600718255ef7aadcf1","825b7a31746c6ae03615aa646e90986137181a9f"],"title":"Topological Data Analysis of Single-Trial Electroencephalographic Signals.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1119"}

One probability model useful in generating an adaptive randomization scheme is an urn model. We will give a short overview of such adaptive models and compare four of them. We will be interested in how these four models minimize the number of treatment failures in a clinical trial with dichotomous response treatments. Comparison will be done via simulations for four treatments and exactly for three treatments for moderate sample sizes. We compare designs under the assumption that the results of treatments are known immediately, and we also allow some delay in response. Power is analyzed under various alternatives. Our results indicate that a birth and death urn with immigration is the best unless success probabilities are very small, in which case a randomized version of Polya's urn is preferred.","inCitations":["bd76f951a6c031d66da63923652ef705cf02ce1c","24d52eaf4f28fb428b88b09b28aab94ba2097c25","15bdf1ecba5390b3c55b00a53f7771bbe2161ebd","e07ea3dce3cee5f8ae76b9f87b9af665ffee71a0","8d21cab14d1b9c212845597c8364a300e1696703","0d842c5e68b3f84496a909b898a06dc7ed82143a","3fc3e9cb750b25933f7b8f5cfb1a2252f01e2063","f8de94ed5537217966d04d985703de7bcd4f81bb","88e0086a960d4066d9e2b6b2e82c5c4bd548534f"],"title":"A comparison of urn designs for randomized clinical trials of K > 2 treatments.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101016"}

A modified longitudinal model was developed that sought to improve resolution in both domains by bringing together data from three sources to estimate daily levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at a geographic location. Monthly NO2 measurements at 316 sites were made available by the Study of Traffic, Air quality and Respiratory health (STAR). Four US Environmental Protection Agency monitoring stations have hourly measurements of NO2. Finally, the Connecticut Department of Transportation provides data on traffic density on major roadways, a primary contributor to NO2 pollution. Inclusion of a traffic variable improved performance of the model, and it provides a method for estimating exposure at points that do not have direct measurements of the outcome. This approach can be used to estimate daily variation in levels of NO2 over a region.","inCitations":["66b4bd8371e7a7cd6478ec9cfde15a9f4c7423d4","6cfb215c1f9afea2d43678944b81358ae655ba91","67355d805dd4de56b92c4f6301b578f6dae3328c"],"title":"Estimating Daily Nitrogen Dioxide Level: Exploring Traffic Effects.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS642"}
