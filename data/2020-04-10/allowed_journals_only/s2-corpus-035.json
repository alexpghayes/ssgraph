(1955, The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 26, 641-647) has long been known to give the maximum likelihood estimator of a series of ordered binomial parameters, based on an independent observation from each distribution (see Barlow et al., 1972, Statistical Inference under Order Restrictions, Wiley, New York). This result has immediate application to estimation of a survival distribution based on current survival status at a set of monitoring times. This paper considers an extended problem of maximum likelihood estimation of a series of 'ordered' multinomial parameters p(i)= (p(1i),p(2i),.,p(mi)) for 1 <or=i <ro=k, where ordered means that p(j1) <or=p(j2) <or=<or=p(jk) for each j with 1 <or=j <or=m-1. The data consist of k independent observations X(1),., X(k) where X(i) has a multinomial distribution with probability parameter p(i) and known index n(i)\\geq 1. By making use of variants of the pool adjacent violator algorithm, we obtain a simple algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimator of p(1),., p(k), and demonstrate its convergence. The results are applied to nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of the sub-distribution functions associated with a survival time random variable with competing risks when only current status data are available (Jewell et al. 2003, Biometrika, 90, 183-197).","inCitations":["b517446667a549e1b26e2a6c53b719e9f22a6d46","5b286aa1c170a4578e2897cb651d6b87f0f51d2d","5a2540389f189a1ac2b668d4e5171561e7704a2d","69346d476015177721b58c8852414fca8ca4a15a","cb9890ac69d7e531a3a830966a08ee26c1bee267","a7b01fc34aefc6e4c9beefaf897661b5bffc0689","7adbfb34159b29933f1cd338ec7710843cc9db7a","376e9b7e84c67859b8d30dd42b00344ccdc51a22","dbbad0b8fd2a230f6854ab8a469fb43918006f76","aaa2c047714ec0c8121b666140cfcadb3b5077ef","6e4c9066a17503636601bead2f782fb1024eae5d","f0abe569c74d3a2504ccd467871a8cd1068d97f7","9568b99315baebf164d8acc36d310c6a4c1443bd","7ec6fc00290fc476342acf7457798d71a529f886","eba4be33c2be120a3516112fc664c944649e0842","9e3762a886e5b7b9f723c4378092322fb89c7ab9","ddbdf0dda00a4304b61b419b11155921d723d2ba","10139a47a457b18623e0084db02f31ad9a9e9976","9cbd391a8c7b33cce6276eb98fdebe3f8058e26d","ce76a29dc272a01c4c160a2f00469ab23097b421","9110b2d42f7e8c9b44678dcf54091fc4faed7325"],"title":"Maximum likelihood estimation of ordered multinomial parameters.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.2.291"}

Instead, we argued that effective data analysis – Bayesian or otherwise – proceeds more messily through a jagged process of formulating research hypotheses, exploring their implications in light of data, and rejecting aspects of our models in light of systematic misfits compared to available data or other sources of information. We associate this last bit with Popper’s falsification or (weakly) with Kuhn’s scientific revolutions, but these connections with classical philosophy of science are not crucial. Our real point is that Bayesian data analysis, in the form that we understand and practise, requires the active involvement of the researcher in constructing and criticizingmodels, and that from this perspective the entire process of Bayesian prior-to-posterior inference can be seen as an elaborate way of understanding the implications of a model so that it can be effectively tested. Just as a chicken is said to be nothing but an egg’s way of making another egg, so posterior inference is a way that a model can evaluate itself. But this inference and evaluation process, in our view, has essentially nothing to do with calculations of the posterior probability of competingmodels. Aswe discuss in our paper, for technical, philosophical, and historical reasons we tend not to trust such marginal posterior probabilities. (See Figure 1 of our paper for the sort of reasoning that we do not like.)

The analysis of longitudinal dyadic data becomes complex when nonignorable dropouts occur. We propose a fully Bayesian selection-model-based approach to analyze longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts. We model repeated measures on subjects by a transition model and account for within-dyad correlations by random effects. In the model, we allow subject's outcome to depend on his/her own characteristics and measure history, as well as those of the other member in the dyad. We further account for the nonignorable missing data mechanism using a selection model in which the probability of dropout depends on the missing outcome. We propose a Gibbs sampler algorithm to fit the model. Simulation studies show that the proposed method effectively addresses the problem of nonignorable dropouts. We illustrate our methodology using a longitudinal breast cancer study.","inCitations":["6874f9119d8c1f889d6d11f7384b292a9e8d5131","2bdf1c1888ea806b277b3817cd83f10d7b92c334"],"title":"Bayesian Modeling Longitudinal Dyadic Data with Nonignorable Dropout, with Application to a Breast Cancer Study.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS515"}

Ideally therefore, dose-limiting events (DLEs) and responses indicative of efficacy should be considered in the dose-escalation procedure. Several methods have been suggested for incorporating both DLEs and efficacy responses in early phase dose-escalation trials. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a Bayesian adaptive approach based on one binary response (occurrence of a DLE) and one continuous response (a measure of potential efficacy) per subject. A logistic regression and a linear log-log relationship are used respectively to model the binary DLEs and the continuous efficacy responses. A gain function concerning both the DLEs and efficacy responses is used to determine the dose to administer to the next cohort of subjects. Stopping rules are proposed to enable efficient decision making. Simulation results shows that our approach performs better than taking account of DLE responses alone. To assess the robustness of the approach, scenarios where the efficacy responses of subjects are generated from an Emax model, but modelled by the linear log-log model are also considered. This evaluation shows that the simpler log-log model leads to robust recommendations even under this model showing that it is a useful approximation to the difficulty in estimating Emax model. Additionally, we find comparable performance to alternative approaches using efficacy and safety for dose-finding.","inCitations":["b026bd9069f7ebf447b215a46096196607b040a0","2b5dda8acaab4719edab07208c8748b66539e729","08ebf7a630f46d36c46993bf2bed70193c369556","f7455ea797f7e18f488986256e2ec1a619ae8b76","632d6084d75d274a70d310567c6da2802272baea","18b1e1048967b301c18de3734acb99169f1195e5","5273f0cb7c002fd09f4cf00ac3511c738ccf99c8"],"title":"Bayesian adaptive dose-escalation procedures for binary and continuous responses utilizing a gain function.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1706"}

They have the advantage of providing an easily interpretable measure of treatment efficacy such as a confidence interval for treatment difference. If there are doubts about the underlying distribution of the response variable, however, a nonparametric approach may be called for. The nonparametric approaches in such settings concentrate on hypothesis testing and are not typically used for providing easily interpretable measures of treatment efficacy. For comparing two treatments, we propose using a nonparametric measure based on the likelihood of observing a better response on one treatment than the other. The bootstrap method is used to construct a confidence interval for the treatment difference.","inCitations":["a81c9211ad9cd55937e7ef398b86f691b47ebdf3","3d9286e578f74ee989f1605ce6cc6c1a8229be88","730d564f8430a85371f94278a2129cdf92598d6b","9d5bada55c8dcabf6321477312c6f70e2b5ad164","9ab3a0cf17da911e39aa519e57c2ed13d1a478bf","23cd7b5dc4b32e29b68e480bbfe9b827cb05650d","8939e534388b7af7f975d7b46131c1ca9a9ba25a","cf647ec8665a81478aa8c4850ddd14693e6e2cd0","d3602920b649346f01bd4fe8d73882aac02d9e9d","beda3b7a57d40f8a15cfd4ac503d0ea832b9b6d4","78545b30204779d13cf21fe15de68f33d22f8538"],"title":"A nonparametric procedure associated with a clinically meaningful efficacy measure.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.3.293"}

In this article, we focus on two of them: First, based on Phase II data, the commercial sponsor decides to invest (or not) in Phase III. Second, based on the outcome of Phase III, the regulator determines whether the drug should be granted market access. Assuming a population of candidate drugs with a distribution of true efficacy, we optimize the two stakeholders' decisions and study the interdependence between them. The regulator is assumed to seek to optimize the total public health benefit resulting from the efficacy of the drug and a safety penalty. In optimizing the regulatory rules, in terms of minimal required sample size and the Type I error in Phase III, we have to consider how these rules will modify the commercial optimization made by the sponsor. The results indicate that different Type I errors should be used depending on the rarity of the disease.","inCitations":["bb48fe50ab7bc8e1ca128f395182eedf67181e0b","cb5e04b32f2f977795185182ea93a4143d733f99","96ddcf52b100e4b260f729723e276e69777b7234"],"title":"A decision theoretical modeling for Phase III investments and drug licensing.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1377729"}

These regression analyses are the foundation for predictions of cause‐specific cumulative incidence functions based on combining the estimated cause‐specific hazard functions. However, in predictions arising from disease registries, where only subjects with disease enter the database, disease‐related mortality may be more naturally modeled on the time since diagnosis time scale while death from other causes may be more naturally modeled on the age time scale. The single time scale methodology may be biased if an incorrect time scale is employed for one of the causes and an alternative methodology is not available. We propose inferences for the cumulative incidence function in which regression models for the cause‐specific hazard functions may be specified on different time scales. Using the disease registry data, the analysis of other cause mortality on the age scale requires left truncating the event time at the age of disease diagnosis, complicating the analysis. In addition, standard Martingale theory is not applicable when combining regression models on different time scales. We establish that the covariate conditional predictions are consistent and asymptotically normal using empirical process techniques and propose consistent variance estimators for constructing confidence intervals. Simulation studies show that the proposed two time scales method performs well, outperforming the single time‐scale predictions when the time scale is misspecified. The methods are illustrated with stage III colon cancer data obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of National Cancer Institute.","inCitations":["38c3f715fa55b2c628eef4056732bdb63205d352"],"title":"On the choice of time scales in competing risks predictions","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw024"}

This assumption not only affects the analysis part but also the sample size calculation. The presence of delayed effects causes a change in the hazard ratio while the trial is ongoing since at the beginning we do not observe any difference between treatment arms, and after some unknown time point, the differences between treatment arms will start to appear. Hence, the proportional hazards assumption no longer holds, and both sample size calculation and analysis methods to be used should be reconsidered. The weighted log-rank test allows a weighting for early, middle, and late differences through the Fleming and Harrington class of weights and is proven to be more efficient when the proportional hazards assumption does not hold. The Fleming and Harrington class of weights, along with the estimated delay, can be incorporated into the sample size calculation in order to maintain the desired power once the treatment arm differences start to appear. In this article, we explore the impact of delayed effects in group sequential and adaptive group sequential designs and make an empirical evaluation in terms of power and type-I error rate of the of the weighted log-rank test in a simulated scenario with fixed values of the Fleming and Harrington class of weights. We also give some practical recommendations regarding which methodology should be used in the presence of delayed effects depending on certain characteristics of the trial.","inCitations":["3f3af231cc65e52b390b7b22fa90f5f88860d2fa","94df5339fcf7c1f1b97af4470b895af178beb300"],"title":"Properties of the weighted log-rank test in the design of confirmatory studies with delayed effects.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1923"}

One of the challenges of achieving this goal is that we usually do not have a priori knowledge of the grouping information of patients with respect to treatment effect. To address this problem, we consider a heterogeneous regression model which allows the coefficients for treatment variables to be subject-dependent with unknown grouping information. We develop a concave fusion penalized method for estimating the grouping structure and the subgroup-specific treatment effects, and derive an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm for its implementation. We also study the theoretical properties of the proposed method and show that under suitable conditions there exists a local minimizer that equals the oracle least squares estimator based on a priori knowledge of the true grouping information with high probability. This provides theoretical support for making statistical inference about the subgroup-specific treatment effects using the proposed method. The proposed method is illustrated in simulation studies and illustrated with real data from an AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study.","inCitations":["3b464a3db9206d9a5bed7eddae6a9d7e40f2b600","2160570aac54c687f2aba21cc1f804916dae2a51","52a6bb8b359d0979dbacced338f90d3185788456"],"title":"Exploration of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects via Concave Fusion","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2018-0026"}

A popular approach for handling measurement error is simulation‐extrapolation (SIMEX). However, its use for estimating causal effects have been examined only in the context of an additive, non‐differential, and homoscedastic classical measurement error structure. In this article we extend the SIMEX methodology, in the context of a mean reverting measurement error structure, to a doubly robust estimator of the average treatment effect when a single covariate is measured with error but the outcome and treatment and treatment indicator are not. Throughout this article we assume that an independent validation sample is available. Simulation studies suggest that our method performs better than a naive approach that simply uses the covariate measured with error.","inCitations":["0b33b020b23eff9adef5ea437c271e7489e9297e"],"title":"A doubly robust estimator for the average treatment effect in the context of a mean‐reverting measurement error","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw046"}

We introduce a new method of estimating undirected conditional independence graphs based on the score matching loss, introduced by Hyvärinen (2005), and subsequently extended in Hyvärinen (2007). The regularized score matching method we propose applies to settings with continuous observations and allows for computationally efficient treatment of possibly non-Gaussian exponential family models. In the well-explored Gaussian setting, regularized score matching avoids issues of asymmetry that arise when applying the technique of neighborhood selection, and compared to existing methods that directly yield symmetric estimates, the score matching approach has the advantage that the considered loss is quadratic and gives piecewise linear solution paths under ℓ1 regularization. Under suitable irrepresentability conditions, we show that ℓ1-regularized score matching is consistent for graph estimation in sparse high-dimensional settings. Through numerical experiments and an application to RNAseq data, we confirm that regularized score matching achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Gaussian case and provides a valuable tool for computationally efficient estimation in non-Gaussian graphical models.","inCitations":["2df0af1689b66892133c677a56646a5385b9824d","ac5cb583cac622bb1325eeaa697f31e6073fe25b","20df179ac839b14f112c2337240bed675bb1b6f3","97eaa9f0de6c085821d8e302cb7f6488fad2cb93","31e2d3fff13d9504ff6231b11d7602d186f63e46","8872300cfec1467aa4e38836b4a7e45f4d276ad6","5f5ad02a966ca038d04c7dd22eb2c9eba0e700dd","4b358245e89fb7678340641f1b5760f9940e32f7","a13f15b97d1d35812c4347696fe764eb8631dd70","f9f6ea35103d95cc7b002fd5b277c7cb4c5e26d6","31d754434eb03126b689bac2456c10fecbf7baf8","844796645da12765a40ba0f20142623641e0012b","1bccb1575756a4bde2556a9fbe34f809b0653036","83a3eb77628f725dcf7f13963d79c103b05276fb","83c8f55b622d82d2ed0bfd82bfd3262ee56aef4e","a095e80ba89401289b4fe1c743d81b863baec71b","20a8f0417c346b7e04aaf2d6fd239f8c10c97805","277f964848e8cfafcfb82b871bba2b68855f293b","0bf5bdde4db433f20cc168b0dceb1456c07ea121","0c06505aa991c5db9bea3c315bdd42999a41124a","f7b2ef01b89dfbbe53ac8bd5bc6be30f2e85ff68","c7d0d2fbb1deb103cd38742da981bc14e979d474","d1528bfa6bc35d1afc5c8a741c55df3b2a87b710","eecaa9800096922a0ca7cccaa29ea782c847ee14","ab0019fd3944ccaeea72a28e17501e9147647abe","6c4a275c7b554cddb4511d6c091ead089aeff26f"],"title":"Estimation of High-Dimensional Graphical Models Using Regularized Score Matching.","doi":"10.1214/16-EJS1126"}

In this article, we introduce the concept of a limit meta-analysis, which leads to shrunken, empirical Bayes estimates of study effects after allowing for small-study effects. This in turn leads to 3 model-based adjusted pooled treatment-effect estimators and associated confidence intervals. We show how visualizing our estimators using the radial plot indicates how they can be calculated using existing software. The concept of limit meta-analysis also gives rise to a new measure of heterogeneity, termed G(2), for heterogeneity that remains after small-study effects are accounted for. In a simulation study with binary data and small-study effects, we compared our proposed estimators with those currently used together with a recent proposal by Moreno and others. Our criteria were bias, mean squared error (MSE), variance, and coverage of 95% confidence intervals. Only the estimators arising from the limit meta-analysis produced approximately unbiased treatment-effect estimates in the presence of small-study effects, while the MSE was acceptably small, provided that the number of studies in the meta-analysis was not less than 10. These limit meta-analysis estimators were also relatively robust against heterogeneity and one of them had a relatively small coverage error.","inCitations":["b683da2cb97f5be1980f085306d607fe1079ad81","77df0e2480b726c005d9c2850f4a1d709abbe593","1f68657460c8e3f25aa8d179081cb40aaaabb9a9","09530632d5b3289f2ab660b8434f14e1bf39645b","907c4f1f39ad45316116c00e5aa89d1deb84c9e9","f8c56389f13fe0ca897c7579ca4722d155470cf8","41b9111dddd226b1f825e40a569d3c307aeeffde","0bf910f47a9a839ff6bab7c1d69e81745b03fee2","a8cfa22290db9394ad4359dfd8ccae28516fb2d5","e0e48f5bcc6fe80a7f68f5079803cda9c9a41a8e","481a3c97f81199560ca5a9fd37514f9b85f4afe3","0b0b5c8efacc650bfe08c3188901bac315b19335","fdd7a937d06f5b022c152d3f90e77b0d20a55893","fb818de3fdade837e9a19128e45f8ef502499698","c9cdcc1bb8217e46fe24b1aca5083ca673472a7c","cf63472d512dac248c76f2e28c3038587b9585db","dbdc43abbadb0a7ace41145ad474be5fa756854a","89c748f6c44a4e5805aafda5bb7cce2f7a5971fa","59f3adbd239bddfb56fc143d41ca05e1b2643c5f","56d539f19e7cafc903126f11c9f3d0d6f38aa33e","8bde5590b8b8ca4cd5e0361e6671f459830c2843","d62c367bca13933a1bb8ae125f077723272987d3","71e1d9d0ea7c5b3befaf749d07a3d6e7756b6cf5","85c6b8884e12e03c3672fcf4694c4b9db64bdaf0","a58b646c09eb0ba0aac1c49c9306db4ef95d5354","f6b9012399501154e9580c827fb91614c26cc146","de8a25fff7bfb0d76fd989654c70581b87bc2212","78d9cda4f92a9d52643f6b12202373841f2455db","dac9c5b6e0dda800b1b6b71307f2eaac890b6235","d3a70d7c2dc8fd033e01b545acfb525a8dda1da2","a35adf4a85e0d491040c855b7c7eb06f046bc853","0de4ecfc91c4153f1def29ff96a4c8424e2d5bad","cfc8040c841d5e7e25602161de48857d28c9b475","73f4a718a4bf54ddcf6860d140f4593003ccbae3","7aaf4e5f945208e6006d8ae01982caaa62ad3833","d4688ee8510d874fa8bc495dce7363d7796da1c2","94535b29e636821fe47eb72ac85adcbb66993ba2","5fa88a4974489ee744754d93fe8ef0e21bf16605","9f949384ef1e579a7c131fd095721e8352f1e2b2","ba02a5584a69293ffe044bd4d9dc3704bba61a77","660168dbe48731c1dae7dfd14a0525404d8e59e5","62a92a4165f9be553aa7cb92f85e0925bc147239","a1a5e781c8f4f95dcdb65fb144c6196410a61965","c4e1a4fc95c0ba9b79232f80adeb66f17c6d4c98","e985d3c92c5c1891e77c9bd7c164b38f159437c4","2060b8bfb6197ea56073887c7176a34fa648f5d7","3e0d0eb58efeee0fb53672e30bfaff8a7d01462c","5ec27820a0c9dd8eabb97816d1099d884980919e","8e6d48b789d36381dde41137d46652c4dc505b83","04512a9fbb32e5726837c99d7a792e1f11fbd9f4","a0fe7bbf8d70b3a10d6c3ba03d292fb8dbd40a6c","fe07f003e76c6b1b6b0626d74970675ec58f805b","e45956c2a59d1eb83d3e11aae40c420a56d69564","6d3e4950fb28cfb430b0e30eb5c785efa3258c80","aef8a92261dc08a64d4e1ae8682152864a3b90d0","b75479c7603ae23143465f66f355c94b7d506c06","c4d881289eb6752399b8432c797306185e0de525","0497ef202c781093fb10c56d9206d34cc86fb3e5","a091333134b6af9328d6cff3b3115dddc8930fbd","8ffd52fb3b6071352e923b034c4c32ae9f1e881d"],"title":"Treatment-effect estimates adjusted for small-study effects via a limit meta-analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq046"}

The rationality of this pattern of preference has been investigated beginning with Samuelson's colleague (SC) who gained notoriety in a well-known paper. SC's pattern of preference is commonly viewed as a behavioural anomaly. Researchers from branches of psychology and economics have analysed the choice and, despite much debate, there remains considerable confusion. An axiomatic analysis of SC's choice has been used to motivate experimental studies in several disciplines. This paper identifies the axiomatic violation as that of an assumed rather than a normative condition. Therefore, contrary to popular belief, SC's choice is consistent with expected utility theory.","inCitations":["18f841eea1f13df3ba9f96e89172675021aa6c1b","a4f9b1364693fbb16443d0a15399f55755a684e9","e70d5a1306693604b7313d29f90bc6ab4a07f88c","1827802e33e6915fa8f49b2014fc4128ff84e2da","f684a6500dfccd2cbdeff95853d07307b72b46b1","849e68da2d9c6f2e88af0ad2961c9b32a8cae729","b697d914f9a41cdc20ac4884c05b1f01af91dda1"],"title":"Decision making in the short and long run: repeated gambles and rationality.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X124143"}

Except in relatively simple problems, semiparametric efficient scores cannot be expressed in closed forms. Instead, the efficient scores are often expressed as solutions to integral equations. Neumann series was proposed in the form of successive approximation to the efficient scores in those situations. Statistical properties of the estimator based on the Neumann series approximation are difficult to obtain and as a result, have not been clearly studied. In this paper, we reformulate the successive approximation in a simple iterative form and study the statistical properties of the estimator based on the reformulation. We show that a doubly-robust locally-efficient estimator can be obtained following the algorithm in robustifying the likelihood score. The results can be applied to, among others, the parametric regression, the marginal regression, and the Cox regression when data are subject to missing values and the missing data are missing at random. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the approach and a real data example is analyzed to demonstrate the use of the approach.","inCitations":["ab1c3d376e5c0c50f7267669910689b7b7c4edd7"],"title":"Estimation and inference based on Neumann series approximation to locally efficient score in missing data problems.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9469.2009.00646.x"}

Examples can be assessing the reliability of multiple raters (or measurement methods), assessing the suitability for tumor evaluation of using a local laboratory or a central laboratory in a randomized clinical trial (RCT), validating surrogate endpoints in a study, determining that the important outcome measurements are interchangeable among the evaluators in an RCT. Any elegant study design cannot overcome the damage by unreliable measurement. Many methods have been developed to assess the agreement of two measurement methods. However, there is little attention to quantify how good the agreement of two measurement methods is. In this paper, similar to the type I error and the power in describing a hypothesis testing, we propose quantifying an agreement assessment using two rates: the discordance rate and the tolerance probability. This approach is demonstrated through examples.","inCitations":["2ca28e32b942332f02fbbba167a33fa333d2d73a"],"title":"Quantifying an Agreement Study","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2014-0030"}

These covariances are necessary to build confidence intervals (CI) for effect size measures in mediation studies. We first analytically derived the covariances between the parameter estimates in a single mediator model. Using the derived covariances, we computed the multivariate-delta standard errors, and built the 95% CIs for the effect size measures. A simulation study evaluated the accuracy of the standard errors as well as the Type I error, power, and coverage of the CIs using various parameter values and sample sizes. Finally, we presented a numerical example and a SAS MACRO that calculates the CIs for the effect size measures.","inCitations":["34448dbfc7c79e3ea4911bda3f6b0290d068c59c","5d1cbf19007be718b51d15183a2f691990d7755b","99765d8689aba0b877b64ff4730f94bde024aaad","630b69a1ce2eb393ffbd642255c51a4687c891eb","20bbcfa9c02fd19fee5900a23a0a36d173a06904","43fee9189c927b843b146625cdc9b2c56adf411f","117f36d7a3e3fc7fbfae27ae1215815ac7bd0e80","169182fecd4ca75a31ea700c9674f7daf0dfca18","5f41c4bdb4b1efe34e6b6646d1be3036c392d172","0469710f9d1788c78edc76184cb6fdff4b0a9a0f","a96e36e2f294d3bc955009ce556683b1834212a7","18a643f826c910721620d54f3b192741e298f90f","f8c86efd055b4330c59e273bef1a55029ec5d095","1efbec6075fee27d929445b2e4f3c36320fc9efd","b4318f6c80dc79ab03116238db1fc35b374484f1"],"title":"Covariances between regression coefficient estimates in a single mediator model.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X331024"}

It is important to estimate the parameters of interest as efficiently as possible. We present a new maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for nested case-control sampling in the context of Cox's proportional hazards model. The MLE is computed by the EM-algorithm, which is easy to implement in the proportional hazards setting. Standard errors are estimated by a numerical profile likelihood approach based on EM aided differentiation. The work was motivated by a nested case-control study that hypothesized that insulin-like growth factor I was associated with ischemic heart disease. The study was based on a population of 3784 Danes and 231 cases of ischemic heart disease where controls were matched on age and gender. We illustrate the use of the MLE for these data and show how the maximum likelihood framework can be used to obtain information additional to the relative risk estimates of covariates.","inCitations":["61f791da2488e9e24745fff79f58b1fad804c4e6","e1147507aecbc4851f37a175149543800d7c0743","8ea7ba113265d1c06903a1b6e2dfbb27e2b6f0d3","065235b7c933d91fc6118bb2540ea585e115c608","edfd1f9c4b97482f96ed5d78ca68af072e7fee56","138d36f4f59ad871862d9733eed20bf1d658cd7f","a0edc3d02ad2297ab307fe374d933a9863b35c52","6c82ff50c4a359219b7eff43835bf3720e1a26a0","c947df1d5f1fb04bd058a7b0af777240cc2275d0","4070ef3f7f5c7e0fbec61399658d13c6033fe837","14cfdc4f77b84610e5a1112a596033e318c2f845","b5c1a00dac5bd97e6a8b99ab5a44685db0041324","75ccea3d95853266dbb79362dfc55ac6bdbee0c3","2bae4665e1ca2e0c81b9521973e56c6d1824bdc4","ee9231f5918739a20752278380ce6ce041ea74c7","b8d08e7006a423460452455970141ae03eec6b84","927eff9ac89ea2d04a6e102b47c4cc0573f3966c","b0c9d1fbd55a979037a0028b46953318a832aa4c"],"title":"Maximum likelihood estimation for Cox's regression model under nested case-control sampling.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.2.193"}
