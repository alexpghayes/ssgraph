Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.","inCitations":["7d7cbbb12edced1af6809c373a18125294b76393","d65501f9f4128063acd5704c921be8c872bf2040","03fb1045cf177086336ba7a130a8c4021045fe73","d39076f18259bdfdaddb516669c7276bf3de9534","8bbd643d27b8cc0e0963950fd79fbddd7b8da594","1dfb38c44ff4bd4534b37c8f42f3e18c282e66e7","4e6a484caf4669ef27984717a7188e1dca358349","e898a76205635a3df17f4cf38eea10e92c29ef04","c9f79e8a77eb870d4334e1271399260a6a6b393d","222f6e62539c4b6373f2381f269b342a8f4d72cd","e705d104e58a8c306a19c51f528632fdcdec0059","37d81ee78013edb2e3c14a2eb96d9cf4ea09e473","d39a3e8289152c7fb5fa6ac78d5a706ff8205f22","327d191ccd9fbdaa5e2f28fb8a5e7653de3b257c","70a8d931a6b9d3b3425a1fe7d4847f4b6035b5dd","02f4bd054a31329646bc78282b459382dc5a4e23","f29d55fbb150ce1858bbfc7b881d7e877f0b1c01","f6cdfb2917b1b81fb06822b8a0a9071b479e82cd","2bb7946204092efbbe296b4ef89cf338705a06ff","02ba74c923318e6a6915d485c395b367ad50768a","8299c50fb571cc3fa5156cfde9c2e3a5b461be00","3184397168e304059da66429bde8480741059975","9d0b9dec866b1cc550d3341e3b204f11749ff55f","0057deed2c13afc288a6936f1c6aaeb4fea55dd4","6699ac768b7f738deb625181d903e7524a6bc66a","55fe1976d2f5fdc8d51e5f63c693959028ce345e","5439b483e72f65e6ce268ed807f059998e10000f","e860b683ce7319f41765aff530772cf51e5f61f8","e9a1c8a5572019e24a650f818412766baa8ade03","9add336834ceae27bab2edef6ea354117edea609","1dcb08b3ee0de98e7d443a2084c11549d20fca82","9f0d93c6734b2da7b8ce4e54d0a88b972c3c7ac0","bcc7b3c9661e852c9bd32c7021ce1ada6e4d1c72","39d632a344cfeb4ab86c3f2652dd39bf5be3fca2","a38c75e551e5d433849baa158babe84290ff10c0","590f0416ff1bf0fd53e67f7a53c6a85c4a82b77f","49d854bc69b5e8c4d65849c21f711c906d68b6ed","d6934aad47f5b80821bee663436ec1d960da8f8c","705f8af4d78e53eceb3444b2fb404aba48ad5f8e","14c55dc7e245dc4db2fe4d389a8f9ebc5f97c7d9","3ca390adebd93b56199b318f3d7b86368f9b0dc4","8245f83e9940a44eae1709c0353b6a41e08332a7","a89fedecab03ee4a6d0bcb18ef89c72fa2fb6758","b95985ac9e0d5f0f6e5e08da16f123d3c4034143","9020630f3fccb60a8e08d071c7f3caea848107a1","430669cd97704f8ecc9c5d55c0ae4b231f53e2df","98eb206ba577b7204d37ef819989d759975dfc6b","48257528d2d9422d2bf4afa02c203f1d803d7d17","675a15f5993eeece2a5dfbf2c6f0f6fc781cd768","daa27d03b3e18e3e455902ffc575b5a4f3196b87","1039a761e4d7a85af92e8b8eb2984df141d211af","430d49ea8f5d33a4e6e70d1b4e535e6d2eccf70d","429e2772645335e845a88b30c87deec11030b3ad","1ffae9b7aea36af8f8cfe785c79acfda4f8c963f","ad259d28b92f23983b8781fe261c1fa23dc09982","544fd050a2cba8e9f07a1c698be1aa4ca48a38b0","4de088f35f27ae6cfdb85189caf8b728548df77f","2d79ac9b517db3e95c96b6c880911821722c5242","56b629c7e764661eff959e8d7f9772c81f0cb679","bee85cbfba1f51caff708001a7b8068c045fe616","7960e690dcca7820e97ee7dc898e183d3c70980d","476e33f35056741255e2eb2b42e460be192d6769","226d40e43b37779fa76a2dfff989689ffced5504","4a5fe106d9274096feb33d95a9018b772201d0c5","42a5e740d6128ccd78d8b5e507269c567df094be","4ee1a36b0b3d95027407deef22620df0f2c2f109","2204fc4f8042b081a4c9a6c9ebaa9fe079cab4de","66c48a712fe0c43a497ffad1371b0fb08f0498e7","19d30d0281c7afdf524e255743c8e506c81a7e2d","9fc531db7b046957a9509ec42224c65f5e5915f4","5e61661cf16fbcde43711b9b46c49b9765d56a21","e867041b735c57652faef2be653123d3805f924b","e2b6d0c9eb200829322a5158971e7fd836b77571","9671768bd2f23d5c6810a1394612f9db529f2edc","33a84b987039e53073763220389de3e7abc73452","d4dc28823b01737aed5b5f9bd2f0a3029066a0fa","44c7fb1730e5349a8e3e1e37f71590851f5b1062","1923582d04f87c8277e1b55028d7229923bd845d","2d5dbba63303b9e68561f61925d2ab1f7aba5616","1acf2de69aadf3dea189cbfcef743cb99afc95ac","ca642af534bcd1bdb06a57672c282d4afd9c7d09","700b18706899fb833332d9f1f35df7a8dd49f186","0a93e32d00e289e5dcb3898d0f66286a89a59f44","70dae529a8efd0a8782a2b39040689e9eea0627b","c87c9c29d55fa6a89194eeac3d71b63fae45ef55","646e13d3a133b01747e62cb379e357d815150dac","3e25898f14ac7c8b33c50ac64bb5523b0f6b311c","bffc9536b9a6a9ee847c3b75413a71daef7e3228","e3216b3bcb674779fefd44b0f95bbdf3d31cdc22","4df7123c91358a70ae37d9e9980a5c8d0e0b6bfc","306b70fa7f83b9729763e9811ba50f62585418d0","a397216fab715025d23fff66970d03d1e9e147c2","923e4e467453ba917c5ff0773785c5a71a1a3ab9","947e14d6129b42addae6abf998318f27a7c04a7b","2bdae952d80d57b58e69fc8dafb721e2a340ac27","13c12860a791c95b86beae879f75bdbb7d0aa79e","772d4c7fa5249d493db6746fb7789764fbf4e36a","0867d2bcce4673c9e09e187998d4f075c07a0f99","790ba86bd6149b06c99fc64835695c5e6b84b3fa","9612834ebe21bb4f1ab3777d762466e4cf6af930","b4e8bd2aaad9e218197fee13fffc6cb9292e936c","02a889a69c1ebf03a4ef369747d3b96533fcaccd","e3547841d29da4e72567cfc7db757f9cbde7e533","83b5855ebc12031b3f1c031844c1cf10c93ae4b6","66d24e5b03431d0f016278f13267d3f27e04ddcc","e1c961b5881c07e2c756e74e2b7d19b87bff9cac","e761f3af9fae44fc7eb3c6ed33fc0afd30a3c096","b15d256bc9b11e170864fa88e17bddf0a39eb202","8e9ef79be0e022be46dc9c4826a7f7c9c6070faf","c2a6564b249da26d81e7a0736f77d524abd2e16e","fe7b3ced89e3330864aa73b91c7775a3877c0ffb","03854f22050b54d8b02514ebb179b077e462ad0d","e65fd6db2bf1cea3d83cabf66f564c7f1a5e21af","e7058f66b844de83a0d59a24ee6912122b2e6e2e","aeeaf559032d0d4de9a938fb81dcfdeb17e139e3","8c1fdb8fbb0d6249a1421c80e5

Radiographs are instrumental in assessing structure damage in RA. Radiographic analyses results have become essential in establishing a \"delay in structural progression\" claim in newly developed agents for the treatment of RA. It is well known that the radiographic progression data generally follow a nonnormal distribution that is loaded with excessive zeros. A special concern about the radiographic data analyses is the handling of the seemingly high rate of missing values due to dropout or unreadable images. There are no uniform ways to handle missing radiographic data, and such data usually show considerable sensitivity to the imputation method chosen under the complexity of the nonnormal data and the unique missing mechanism. In this research, we proposed both an innovative multiple-imputation algorithm and a novel method called the mean rank imputation method under the nonparametric framework for sensitivity analyses. A simulation study was designed using rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to extensively assess and compare the finite performance of these two new methods along with four other missing data handling methods previously used in the RA trials, namely, linear extrapolation, last observation carried-forward (LOCF), median quartile bin imputation, and median imputation under various settings. Our simulation results suggest that the multiple-imputation algorithm, providing an mITT analysis population, yields an inflated type I error and artificially good power. The proposed mean rank imputation method, following a true ITT principle, both is powerful and maintains type I error at the nominal level.","inCitations":["3b7485c9fb7070a7f59270a4bbcf4dca5fcb1c2d"],"title":"Missing radiographic data handling in randomized clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.834913"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2016,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"There are several challenging statistical problems identified in the regulatory review of large cardiovascular (CV) clinical outcome trials and central nervous system (CNS) trials. The problems can be common or distinct due to disease characteristics and the differences in trial design elements such as endpoints, trial duration, and trial size. In schizophrenia trials, heavy missing data is a big problem. In Alzheimer trials, the endpoints for assessing symptoms and the endpoints for assessing disease progression are essentially the same; it is difficult to construct a good trial design to evaluate a test drug for its ability to slow the disease progression. In CV trials, reliance on a composite endpoint with low event rate makes the trial size so large that it is infeasible to study multiple doses necessary to find the right dose for study patients. These are just a few typical problems. In the past decade, adaptive designs were increasingly used in these disease areas and some challenges occur with respect to that use. Based on our review experiences, group sequential designs (GSDs) have borne many successful stories in CV trials and are also increasingly used for developing treatments targeting CNS diseases. There is also a growing trend of using more advanced unblinded adaptive designs for producing efficacy evidence. Many statistical challenges with these kinds of adaptive designs have been identified through our experiences with the review of regulatory applications and are shared in this article.","inCitations":["b5b414e321f2a9d99b9191b6fd4f37bd8de2c785"],"title":"Statistical challenges in a regulatory review of cardiovascular and CNS clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1092025"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"An important problem within the social, behavioral, and health sciences is how to partition an exposure effect (e.g. treatment or risk factor) among specific pathway effects and to quantify the importance of each pathway. Mediation analysis based on the potential outcomes framework is an important tool to address this problem and we consider the estimation of mediation effects for the proportional hazards model in this paper. We give precise definitions of the total effect, natural indirect effect, and natural direct effect in terms of the survival probability, hazard function, and restricted mean survival time within the standard two-stage mediation framework. To estimate the mediation effects on different scales, we propose a mediation formula approach in which simple parametric models (fractional polynomials or restricted cubic splines) are utilized to approximate the baseline log cumulative hazard function. Simulation study results demonstrate low bias of the mediation effect estimators and close-to-nominal coverage probability of the confidence intervals for a wide range of complex hazard shapes. We apply this method to the Jackson Heart Study data and conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the impact on the mediation effects inference when the no unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding assumption is violated.","inCitations":["da7bda93ab312d1e31e9ef721a6b4dcf976e60b2","730b917245f2372e37c0be962797b27b70f54700","bc3e2a2a9b4e2c46476e1d2944818194b77f0981"],"title":"Causal Mediation Analysis for the Cox Proportional Hazards Model with a Smooth Baseline Hazard Estimator.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12188"}

Convolution can be used to associate two vectors (representing items to be remembered) into a memory trace vector in one operation. An approximation to either of the input vectors can then be retrieved, using the other vector as a probe. Recent convolution-based memory models have accounted for a wide range of data. Connectionist models may have greater potential for providing developmental accounts, but the architectures that have been most widely used to account for developmental phenomena cannot perform one-trial learning and this has limited their use as models of human memory. We show that a connectionist-like architecture can learn, using a gradient-descent algorithm, to perform single-trial learning in a similar manner to convolution. The solution that the network finds leads to less variable retrieval than does convolution. Furthermore, the network can learn to carry out the convolution operation itself. This provides a link between connectionist and convolution approaches, and a basis for models with many of the attractions of both connectionist and convolution approaches.","inCitations":["a4bb5276f5cc16ac43d7796ea5b7cdb19f7b95d6","675b0c5150c3c439ad1056e8486cb2604963a9b9","e6881f78d3154667968903e86158c4154167041c"],"title":"Modelling human memory: connectionism and convolution.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1996.tb01072.x"}

In datasets where many genes are expressed and many are not expressed (i.e., underexpressed), a bimodal distribution for the gene expression levels often results, where one mode of the distribution represents the expressed genes and the other mode represents the underexpressed genes. To model this bimodality, we propose a new class of mixture models that utilize a random threshold value for accommodating bimodality in the gene expression distribution. Theoretical properties of the proposed model are carefully examined. We use this new model to examine the problem of differential gene expression between two groups of subjects, develop prior distributions, and derive a new criterion for determining which genes are differentially expressed between the two groups. Prior elicitation is carried out using empirical Bayes methodology in order to estimate the threshold value as well as elicit the hyperparameters for the two component mixture model. The new gene selection criterion is demonstrated via several simulations to have excellent false positive rate and false negative rate properties. A gastric cancer dataset is used to motivate and illustrate the proposed methodology.","inCitations":["a6b4d002170562343e40dfb1d8114b6c7c35ee8b","ad069b947021440ec78343ee991bc1e3455406fd","9eb094c71f93e3591b127d1a22c9b60c440e039a","f66d9732b7c4ffe07a592f28db0eb8f45953c1f3"],"title":"A new class of mixture models for differential gene expression in DNA microarray data.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2007.06.007"}

We investigate both small-sample and large-sample properties of both two-sided and one-sided coverage, with an emphasis on asymptotic methods. In terms of aligning the smoothed coverage probability surface with the nominal confidence level, we find that the score-based methods on the whole have the best two-sided coverage, although they have slight deficiencies for confidence levels of 90% or lower. For an easily taught, hand-calculated method, the Brown-Li 'Jeffreys' method appears to perform reasonably well, and in most situations, it has better one-sided coverage than the widely recommended alternatives. In general, we find that the one-sided properties of many of the available methods are surprisingly poor. In fact, almost none of the existing asymptotic methods achieve equal coverage on both sides of the interval, even with large sample sizes, and consequently if used as a non-inferiority test, the type I error rate (which is equal to the one-sided non-coverage probability) can be inflated. The only exception is the Gart-Nam 'skewness-corrected' method, which we express using modified notation in order to include a bias correction for improved small-sample performance, and an optional continuity correction for those seeking more conservative coverage. Using a weighted average of two complementary methods, we also define a new hybrid method that almost matches the performance of the Gart-Nam interval.","inCitations":["a5934f3ff638aefae996772f8e3daf35d4105ad5","b8469bd4df32fefbf6e77929cf382dedde74d454","bd08ba95a08d13137e3744fbba3d96cecd77d5d7","9f66370110ef5bd959f1af77a6ae38c581a37437","f9872312bddb1603bb5bac810acee9773c6893cc"],"title":"Confidence intervals for the difference between independent binomial proportions: comparison using a graphical approach and moving averages.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1631"}

Careful attention to identifying this population of inference can lead to resolution of some issues commonly debated in the analysis of clinical trials.

The utility increment used to define near-optimality is nonincreasing with sample size. The adaptive randomization uses each dose's posterior probability of a set of good outcomes, defined by a lower utility cutoff. Saturated parametric models are assumed for the marginal dose-toxicity and dose-efficacy distributions, allowing the possible requirement of monotonicity in dose, and a copula is used to obtain a joint distribution.

Examples include medical expenditures, in which the zeros represent patients who do not use health services, while the continuous distribution describes the level of expenditures among users. Semicontinuous data are customarily analyzed using two-part mixture models. In the spatial analysis of semicontinuous data, two-part models are especially appealing because they provide a joint picture of how health services utilization and associated expenditures vary across geographic regions. However, when applying these models, careful attention must be paid to distributional choices, as model misspecification can lead to biased and imprecise inferences. This paper introduces a broad class of Bayesian two-part models for the spatial analysis of semicontinuous data. Specific models considered include two-part lognormal, log skew-elliptical, and Bayesian non-parametric models. Multivariate conditionally autoregressive priors are used to link model components and provide spatial smoothing across neighboring regions, resulting in a joint spatial modeling framework for health utilization and expenditures. We develop a fully conjugate Gibbs sampling scheme, leading to efficient posterior computation. We illustrate the approach using data from a recent study of emergency department expenditures.","inCitations":["2ff2a5035839e1019fdcef6596fb56ef63e9f328","45dd90576b48e9ad77aae4f59e4482cb72109aae","c5db44398d0e86670c61342549328e8fa79146b1","51e0afee613607bc23635b70b3607f2a66f7c74c","96b1f9f23bd9c57bcbfbca2ed322a1938f1bedf2"],"title":"Bayesian two-part spatial models for semicontinuous data with application to emergency department expenditures.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu062"}

Despite a thorough methodological treatment and the potential for substantial efficiency gains, the two-phase design has not been widely adopted. This may be due, in part, to a lack of general-purpose, readily-available software. The osDesign package for R provides a suite of functions for analyzing data from a two-phase and/or case-control design, as well as evaluating operating characteristics, including bias, efficiency and power. The evaluation is simulation-based, permitting flexible application of the package to a broad range of scientific settings.

It is frequently used as the primary endpoint in randomized clinical trials. There are two main disadvantages associated with the use of composite endpoints: a) in conventional analyses, all components are treated equally important; and b) in time-to-event analyses, the first event considered may not be the most important component. Recently Pocock et al. (2012) introduced the win ratio method to address these disadvantages. This method has two alternative approaches: the matched pair approach and the unmatched pair approach. In the unmatched pair approach, the confidence interval is constructed based on bootstrap resampling, and the hypothesis testing is based on the non-parametric method by Finkelstein and Schoenfeld (1999). Luo et al. (2015) developed a close-form variance estimator of the win ratio for the unmatched pair approach, based on a composite endpoint with two components and a specific algorithm determining winners, losers and ties. We extend the unmatched pair approach to provide a generalized analytical solution to both hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction for the win ratio, based on its logarithmic asymptotic distribution. This asymptotic distribution is derived via U-statistics following Wei and Johnson (1985). We perform simulations assessing the confidence intervals constructed based on our approach versus those per the bootstrap resampling and per Luo et al. We have also applied our approach to a liver transplant Phase III study. This application and the simulation studies show that the win ratio can be a better statistical measure than the odds ratio when the importance order among components matters; and the method per our approach and that by Luo et al., although derived based on large sample theory, are not limited to a large sample, but are also good for relatively small sample sizes. Different from Pocock et al. and Luo et al., our approach is a generalized analytical method, which is valid for any algorithm determining winners, losers and ties.

A gold standard (GS) test on the true disease status is required to estimate the VUS and PVUS. However, oftentimes it may be difficult, inappropriate, or impossible to have a GS because of misclassification error, risk to the subjects or ethical concerns. Therefore, in many medical research studies, the true disease status may remain unobservable. Under the normality assumption, a maximum likelihood (ML) based approach using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation is proposed. Three methods using the concepts of generalized pivot and parametric/nonparametric bootstrap for confidence interval estimation of the difference in paired VUSs and PVUSs without a GS are compared. The coverage probabilities of the investigated approaches are numerically studied. The proposed approaches are then applied to a real data set of 118 subjects from a cohort study in early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center to compare the overall diagnostic accuracy of early stage AD between two different pairs of neuropsychological tests.","inCitations":["1c7fe803c0879bf8ef79bb9097e3e1b20031ad5e","a7f8fe5947a1ae6573fa1b6e82374373921833ad"],"title":"Estimating confidence intervals for the difference in diagnostic accuracy with three ordinal diagnostic categories without a gold standard","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2013.07.007"}

Computational statistics","paperAbstract":"Geographic areas of different sizes and shapes of polygons that represent counts or rate data are often encountered in social, economic, health, and other information. Often political or census boundaries are used to define these areas because the information is available only for those geographies. Therefore, these types of boundaries are frequently used to define neighborhoods in spatial analyses using geographic information systems and related approaches such as multilevel models. When point data can be geocoded, it is possible to examine the impact of polygon shape on spatial statistical properties, such as clustering. We utilized point data (alcohol outlets) to examine the issue of polygon shape and size on visualization and statistical properties. The point data were allocated to regular lattices (hexagons and squares) and census areas for zip-code tabulation areas and tracts. The number of units in the lattices was set to be similar to the number of tract and zip-code areas. A spatial clustering statistic and visualization were used to assess the impact of polygon shape for zip- and tract-sized units. Results showed substantial similarities and notable differences across shape and size. The specific circumstances of a spatial analysis that aggregates points to polygons will determine the size and shape of the areal units to be used. The irregular polygons of census units may reflect underlying characteristics that could be missed by large regular lattices.

(2002b, Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics 54, 827-839, henceforth BMSRB) where a class of non-iterative estimators of the variance of the heterogeneity distribution for the standardized mortality ratio was discussed. Here, these estimators are further investigated by means of a simulation study. In addition, iterative estimators including the Clayton-Kaldor procedure as well as the pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PML) approach are added in the comparison. Among all candidates, the PML estimator often has the smallest mean square error, followed by the non-iterative estimator where the weights are proportional to the external expected counts. This confirms the theoretical result in BMSRB in which an asymptotic efficiency could be proved for this estimator (in the class of non-iterative estimators considered). Surprisingly, the Clayton-Kaldor iterative estimator (often recommended and used by practitioners) performed poorly with respect to the MSE. Given the widespread use of these estimators in disease mapping, medical surveillance, meta-analysis and other areas of public health, the results of this study might be of considerable interest.","inCitations":["ce7b6013625ad5c9baf4c66174683484944dd408","d5735e45a6f9916c9c9959d78e1d5b38d193330f","9d1e1e964f146dcc1f08fc0642c76bd44a1d6a21","c9a450bde8ed4f607961455e361d876118ba9ce3","80cd49b2b46184eb795ee349d02c52a32d8d7df8","163b6b6b4ffd9ca5f32a8338c75ed9a341ff06aa"],"title":"A comparison of non-iterative and iterative estimators of heterogeneity variance for the standardized mortality ratio.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.1.61"}

When used with the canonical link function, these GAMs provide semi-parametrically adjusted odds ratios and rate ratios. For adjustment of other effect measures, including rate differences, risk differences and relative risks, non-canonical link functions must be used together with a constrained parameter space. However, the algorithms used to fit these models typically rely on a form of the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm, which can be numerically unstable when a constrained non-canonical model is used. We describe an application of a combinatorial EM algorithm to fit identity link Poisson, identity link binomial and log link binomial GAMs in order to estimate semi-parametrically adjusted rate differences, risk differences and relative risks. Using smooth regression functions based on B-splines, the method provides stable convergence to the maximum likelihood estimates, and it ensures that the estimates always remain within the parameter space. It is also straightforward to apply a monotonicity constraint to the smooth regression functions. We illustrate the method using data from a clinical trial in heart attack patients.","inCitations":["6e4cdf1790f316c8b1fa9253814c2997a5d6ea4d","4a686a6c700d37428be10ee68ff517536588b622","af69ea9b7be61c280a881f1af185583fc3d3aa86","6146fcece22363368121361baddbe2aea1ff8f8e"],"title":"Flexible Regression Models for Rate Differences, Risk Differences and Relative Risks","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2014-0044"}

Within the Bayesian framework, a popular choice of prior has been Zellner's g-prior which is based on the inverse of empirical covariance matrix of the predictors. An extension of the Zellner's prior is proposed in this article which allow for a power parameter on the empirical covariance of the predictors. The power parameter helps control the degree to which correlated predictors are smoothed towards or away from one another. In addition, the empirical covariance of the predictors is used to obtain suitable priors over model space. In this manner, the power parameter also helps to determine whether models containing highly collinear predictors are preferred or avoided. The proposed power parameter can be chosen via an empirical Bayes method which leads to a data adaptive choice of prior. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to show how the power parameter is well determined from the degree of cross-correlation within predictors. The proposed modification compares favorably to the standard use of Zellner's prior and an intrinsic prior in these examples.","inCitations":["bb834dbd4c64508228da0eab0e08e359004886a4","2382b63f1d6f69c5c607debca97bf9a7def257cd","2760372d268d99a0831f3389784561668571fa60","69f7f5155e29a2994a79409e41987c526e789ecc","c73790d078ae2782731a92108f5b19bcde5a2c4c","3054cc7f82a78ad7621e011c9794fff4937ef28b","1f210f9c849819264828e0facc53837c51be6e3d","62f81f57b9a1e63a0c7561f95147e34180ac9097","f62c806b177696e005683693c4374c00ca1e9785","35a74d5c81df68b9923642551c740c6873117e52","4ac6e0075862c132b7ded9032209dd30009ecc2f","387a8fb7d07d6f0d1e8d9c7e67432659505e907e"],"title":"Bayesian variable selection using an adaptive powered correlation prior.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2008.12.004"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2002,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"We consider the problem of estimating the intensity functions for a continuous time 'illness-death' model with intermittently observed data. In such a case, it may happen that a subject becomes diseased between two visits and dies without being observed. Consequently, there is an uncertainty about the precise number of transitions. Estimating the intensity of transition from health to illness by survival analysis (treating death as censoring) is biased downwards. Furthermore, the dates of transitions between states are not known exactly. We propose to estimate the intensity functions by maximizing a penalized likelihood. The method yields smooth estimates without parametric assumptions. This is illustrated using data from a large cohort study on cerebral ageing. The age-specific incidence of dementia is estimated using an illness-death approach and a survival approach.","inCitations":["50d75c5fe8ccce013ecb91f4840648221c997c0c","977f5ed1de5f69de182c9b21e3de826a42a9ee18","16288b2d0f70d8359dab7fa7ae0b3bbf208a5d4c","f7496f1749bbdc73e11bb3e4e3f0d4de26e6d5fa","b9124bcc3976f97aff3cd3d07634598b385c6762","5b7df4eb3144b6a1ca2be6e7a42c42621c8de79b","e2ea2cf68afdd047134cd00cad10fa8f6574b5a5","a89a662fc178559afcf8763bd9408c35d7534cef","881e2de0cd51722fe8bc575d0334f72507a135a1","35f8f6b2a910681d11e9474068f9840f9ec67a81","4b3ca5b50f0a81bf946401425f98d95d15d45a45","c753220aca4ab535b098cbc6f58da8a7346a5665","c604d05772e4eabbbb509fef5924c50da5099cf0","fed7414c2747856f94592caab6c417a3bda0a6d2","2f81d13ff51bceb48d49f9a90d9cb0f4b9c29a5d","86306ced5eac5e5c14225ab728891d55df9bb0c1","8495b96be1c3b9edcd9c4848df94b5ac8ba252a1","9fbdb86890958925daf43edf8d8d4c519ec4b7f5","485663a3052376061fab263f037439a5f5839eb9","557c5e7c5a1000284dcc87b472508cc69a377e50","f8e2c0aeb23e61b15d96f4d35dc7618724f9aa14","07795258def301e03bb3e21db819181aa905b623","b730c5a6ad10ebb0f475f7c874011798bb9eb31a","9d5f5f37b70d4fbc9da6687cb1729756e7542e0e","04cff2c63893c547dbafe17d283b87ec89e010ce","04021ec73ddf78f3e9489fc5971f9ece1b9aefec","ea7f07e84e551714f520de4df57bc307b4c93596","da810a5b0e110ced5b7098980d84be18b0417c6d","37557c0e264d50227ef5fa2f8c4eac53f7b1d61a","c99b823138a32720313d16323968a17f32172a03","eed6ea2ede665cc65bf20693ef6ba0614ac7b33b","e38f89db7066bc0ea4a9d2c3eff73d7f6effdc5b","7ca794cf593914376fae503ed71e3b062d1f9cfa","41af1b9e5d1f0a26355ff2d9c01109b6172be638","a690fd3de3ac5c75f863fed8e934307a8eed4d37","a80e106f284d2d0a4856bd0584e816ec89e21862","c9d6951ab0f29b40c50b4beb5777ffbb798cc30d","c34e0ad8704d00edce1fb08d19d16af7d19d7ac2","5ee5ed39a1412ac619a58845c0ebad9953b6d01a","9c7ac18aa55bc82d0848256dd743216318da444f","ee44c6dca6fcedf553c3beef23c0af82bf925b20","9987fa1138797b91b5806357c2e58ac38fbee4b4","1fb23c937c9dc3d554ac8bd93a3a5d786c591e25","856dd90e0f2e15a515f6be15b98f807d3465d80f","5256c264d42f4e3cbecc0975c9b7b5f0cde0618e","05414e1bc7144e782bc49850ac0959e0ae71f4e7","4d6bb36010825487475f7333a0fa36fa148dee3c","73c7051a175ae59fa00de7ec1062eeb713d7536d","f4f8cfd5dc8e284b2be0970c4151fa97b304667f","9b381b739bfc5d6317b202694b5989335df93177","e21c2918e6cac0615a1a59aaa772fea96134cf55","73cee8801222d5e5cb40d312b72fcff3c7260d38","a0f0fbe522e646f6136b3d31b2ab689f9513e2a2","7c8402c2aab97cea1797cd2b88409771c6c3b504","f0919b3e3307dd484c13d102f8f88490db11f6a5","872aba31dcf7f6942ddcbcb740d5afc41c85af0f","92a7e87ea1a78a5887bf5164afd21218ee4c8a05","239a7ec65c6a42f210f6407f3801999b9758352d","d7873fe0dcdb34de8df90dcc135cadad154ffda2","57f46079a46e93023dca339443ce7034a45e2d82","085f31ed0547817a3fabdf920be222a4b1284be4","56f9c8767934ca379fdd95049980a0ba849ac150","c9093b7026e815d60c6d378c0725d923d7f71ea5","4705e7ea76ff0c00cc5661b45151ac4d73210108","ef315407f8ce32e70e3b1a27af2059bccd404520","af87a0f1fd4a002b27ac3263812669be54d35433","1c56f11d29332655475fb628bec363a1c5029410","f4fae58c74e8df1ac76139f507ed2a2bfa19de4a","439cb81323da7239cb793aac079b935a82518bc7","07e6b08afc8e11394333863098177c82555a46e3","ab26c08fe564cced6b5149f8d58fe9602666826a","8d0f687eec5b1065f424c2980829c1040e5467f1","20be6c4057c287748963b7176ef47f1d36ab74e6","89910215b108fdd4facba50cef8c5307dbbb7792","ec3f6c181148f0b3c8e05e627fc4b1e728656db4","7de879318d0b2de07557d0ad49a248d98f5c109e","9087aaa9669478fe24b3d1f6a6d6bebf06954cfd","62ca0f2633263e54715923c941c0d883eb665a8a","9723e67679821dde4d713e539681a27950796d3e","ae80700bc3f3701218fdc8eff74c07331e2b8ff7","3e63b7a1e877b66311551226bdb95acb5ef65a45","a3eb330ce95870b84af91ef1a336ccaa77e03879","b013705778f95da558933c636ffda0146770d4ec","b431860233a4809669cd218cdc04f89e2e2905f0","e52cd5ede497d150db7c36ec33749f176fa797e1","d813309d7266472527f773dc2c6b2a52b0067d22","502078a63d284f3a7452ac1c13670df36eb01c42","ed7f6d0639230acf0ef8f485b7bc87daa2c77d03","d826189578e70bc58e3687a4493ca483602e427c","143b9ad2659b39777c73a9046f57dc3159119cb9","4032666a2d1244f3515a375231ab5ad6ecc6735b","ae7a95693665db7ea14c5fd1dd7c4b83f172dda1","411a1af3c09f5be64ed16e787e9407d809779c43"],"title":"A penalized likelihood approach for an illness-death model with interval-censored data: application to age-specific incidence of dementia.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.3.433"}

We provide a tutorial illustrating an approach to estimation of and inference about direct, indirect, and total effects in statistical mediation analysis with a multicategorical independent variable. The approach is mathematically equivalent to analysis of (co)variance and reproduces the observed and adjusted group means while also generating effects having simple interpretations.

This method generalizes the idea of the \"nearest shrunken centroids\" (NSC) (Tibshirani and others, 2003) into the classical discriminant analysis. The SCRDA method is specially designed for classification problems in high dimension low sample size situations, for example, microarray data. Through both simulated data and real life data, it is shown that this method performs very well in multivariate classification problems, often outperforms the PAM method (using the NSC algorithm) and can be as competitive as the support vector machines classifiers.
