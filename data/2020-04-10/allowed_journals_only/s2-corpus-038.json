Additionally, our framework includes linear and nonlinear effects of functional and scalar covariates that may vary smoothly over the index of the functional response. It accommodates densely or sparsely observed functional responses and predictors which may be observed with additional error and includes both spline-based and functional principal component-based terms. Estimation and inference in this framework is based on standard additive mixed models, allowing us to take advantage of established methods and robust, flexible algorithms. We provide easy-to-use open source software in the pffr() function for the R-package refund. Simulations show that the proposed method recovers relevant effects reliably, handles small sample sizes well and also scales to larger data sets. Applications with spatially and longitudinally observed functional data demonstrate the flexibility in modeling and interpretability of results of our approach.","inCitations":["1f72f4369155a6f4216eff909b8a17fa7ee676b9","b3a2670dc08d3d26fb3616a78526d03d62293957","8d5660da80719ca8d2bc73489d4feb6a4fe63d16","8db154f1f024904d8eeaa4d618b6b1dd5d31a99d","f70615e3a8f095896f92a358a1cd2325d1851706","924308e7cf5c11aa1e5482e237d198fa131dccf1","e0e5f26a1a9d85c4a98af98a2cad115c3cb44351","300f05aa8ba4458ee5bf8e6ca627e5f600f903fd","26104384576ededf96087bd6e4af7cda8caac9f8","459a53dcc4dad1d28c7313df349674f41ed2a0b3","2f79f8c8b1766f5f2f2b28ad34678d9591a25f5d","7d4d391b22933f993136f2151a4dbaadf878e18a","3ce29850e6536b6de1b8635866690b8c8d229368","95bc1bdeff3a441adeb43d89f0278e0999bfa439","a1003e16be3ed862d051f8385571bcb75dce5468","0267126647f0f212ac45c71ad09029c0be2df481","5c8fb81b1ad7ca0d54b58006c89b82ed7584fbeb","669520c5157e7fbe650a91b8476dcb902dc88ee2","90354c804e4e709ee0992765cecf1fac0ae23d27","f424aa629ed83486b56531188ff6eb92ed6c8ad5","593fd48ccf9a70e2142bb39d3147959c149bdc18","9c976ae915a6eb200804051e31d1d2bf32860ef1","e185fc8379511f88df1d16aee2c2f3cd62167c92","2b287095d3256737a1ec3631ae9c65fc9aa32d11","e61a8c49d6e1acc3602d4aa771ff9cbf4e9a8e08","71d7df3cdd74e9c2a303790dd72a2072c8b73296","87a116e8f1046988fb48696709f2cd28ed222a7d","287806c883a167e23e7b3a1430b752a2d5dc5d88","758ee11263f034a0b02f897b75dcd7a671e8d54c","a4563e73eaafc4a1e46456599abac370101d225b","5f19b48eb4e039be7473e6ac11dde968b12cdf78","b66a77fb608f7685879d485bba3022e047272f3e","d747f5a6829a6dff96f04d7e22b94c02b8737e07","62d7fe3b6d045bfa9cc117b890cb44fef5073bda","77a7e028c624e68d7f8d83de0bb5222a9db27956","8e47a70d21d8b3cd59a50a6fb8d25483ba5bbe5a","6bc01ab828c27b42f6e2bed7c54f514cdf16ed3f","957e1b0aee3586f28d36543222a9b4ca97de6df8","7f892f2cbcf98446b7db204137aec817a55e1486","790b917cf06f832c519be77bda822ed2c406122e","2c6e7ae8eec427a794f98c789ed679c5e0733e3e","ba963e491cada9a8dc663970e552f888be303e34","bcf131f7351014d5462adf2de4e5308dc8d7dd4c","2163c538b18e3fee559fcd782a04ba8942cb178d","7eb06c0297704ee74d2d2df94ee4c94fa0d755d0","9d2aa689305a0fb4230af70c7e05fdcb030aa182","81b9bbd6bff1ca924367b110e075c9a54a0a4510","88a44ed7e583e084f3c097d04913f9e5d0d35d85","62199598054bcc322d2bdf9966fa0e485e51e7ff","1f211db351ad7528d9aafc93767f30e8cc185571","24f649f534f4d9afe1cb06c080577f53ff5d7d0a","569ae7e7f4733ad3f5f93c26da443ab766138975","75f5b32d39f7f0a93cce9fa37d736bdf990135eb","9d3ff91eefa43ff2781def539da1acc0e9495a26","47e2289f590bffe563b6d35115eb7181857db0ad","7ac8c8a6c634915dd30676ada42423e5a43d2967","8bf620765e77c98424983de5d5b74b90d99e28fd","78558f3c82a74d6e54dd603422cb52a8853a34b1","089f7ba8d16d8ad597a21453afdf923cc93fac8b","d55d848238cc9a2356eb302e1b9140f1c0fe04e4","bb11b71f6bcba2cada99ce6b8f8c2f7c6971e1d4","81e8276adbcbfd861dfe634812319cb139fc266e","32c303575935b2a995dcc52aee866d6e11d61c6b","f6f74d14155e063dfd58314a17e0f77544befade","fc226820b90fbf833ac021fcf664ff4b31177871","35912c52cf06a03ace0f6a9febb9fcd6d6a02bd2","4c62275567c654e7ef6d4922245fef38d74499da","fcd4369e1d841f55d44ebe7a0c4a6f0294630afd","cf7c025b5ca3c0e936828d783667d4f862364b0e","4996a46b26c79bc3711bce2a136309e514a8c973","73d335998be684a3cf7ed1db1ee058591ba2d1a4","f2852bf162aab9e651aaa81f4efbb9f7b6bc3485","0904279ddce1fe60702b33203630a665f9724633","b8ae8074cab4f93475151eea6b25fb54f91cdf6f","1c3af3df8e68c9c1fc14ebe89b0be661613bd665","c89ad2e02f3b65a397b1ca1bf95480e6ab277f29","f7acf274c393d58dd76b789dbf2c3d0830368a3a","0e07e609307e1599a04545cb76c46cc154c39ba1","f0bf381873906b589a23093d0060548885ed2707","f12572b636d60a1a03c2e18fcad041f90ae9aaea","16f945942f4e586fa131c241243a3381c10a47f5","fa6812477d411791624ce7f817b6a1e582c69ac5","f1562a78dce9336ab12be7d3bc0799d07cc038ff","c207c44106e74d0fd59072f17c19a8ab26589810","8df28c9b5b1b880117e8576f9ec5d5349f339281"],"title":"Functional Additive Mixed Models.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2014.901914"}

Two alternative approaches to modeling longitudinal data with incomplete measurements have frequently been proposed in the literature, selection models and pattern-mixture models. In this paper we focus on, by way of sensitivity analysis, extrapolating incomplete patterns using identifying restrictions. Perhaps the best known ones are so-called complete case missing value restrictions (CCMV), where for a given pattern, the conditional distribution of the missing data, given the observed data, is equated to its counterpart in the completers. Available case missing value (ACMV) restrictions equate this conditional density to the one calculated from the subgroup of all patterns for which all required components have been observed. Neighboring case missing value restrictions (NCMV) equate this conditional density to the one calculated from the the pattern with one additional measurement obtained. In this paper, these three identifying restriction strategies are used to multiply impute missing data in a study in metastatic prostate cancer. Multiple imputation is employed to reduce the uncertainty of single imputation. It is shown how hypothesis testing and sensitivity analyses are carried out in this setting.","inCitations":["a585ca8c1761df656a35e862e14f33c7e1dcc38e","49cc394637c0df88a1bfc149bae0d0e919156b15","b6b1afcd00449400d1200344383b997fc0112570","dc7e2990011bde9aeb2e49a8e581064c6abb48e9","2d2fdfa72ff4ae592a599dcdbe1c52953a510eab","8372b528ccf4fab2a9c7db01307753f5cac0f3bb","7bd03df1de8dc83a2a5cb26926134af70cc70437","275de55e9b881e1665dee56c4c76093caff2fbdf","b0cedea67a58bf94d339bceda5963dd48ca61c98","749f03a67cf523f8b13eb91d0d3c7962f6019da8","2ddce4cd3a9ffd4bd5c56d232ca96aae652ea322"],"title":"Sensitivity analysis for pattern mixture models.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120028510"}

We construct a graph representing thousands of protein functional relationships by integrating knowledge from public databases and review articles. We use the notion of distance in a graph to define pathway neighborhoods. The pathways perturbed in an experiment are then identified as the subgraph induced by the genes, referred to as activity centers, having significant density of transcriptional activity in their functional neighborhoods. We illustrate the predictive power of this approach by performing and analyzing an experiment of TP53 overexpression in NCI-H125 cells. The detected activity centers are in agreement with the known TP53 activation effects and our independent experimental results. We also apply the method to a serum starvation experiment using HEY cells and investigate the predicted activity of the transcription factor MYC. Finally, we discuss interesting properties of the activity center approach and its possible applications beyond the comparison of two experiments.","inCitations":["310d4b373f0ba06ceab6f90b6d84066a9b97581e","eee59aa7714c11834eb594616fb5e10ff775388f","99c5fe22c8029b571c7ec1db17b0a53955cbce0e","0dde2b1011cbec1b85ba8956c1f64c0d8af72657","6b66736d3d901275ad55f5a411314d47e200bb41","721391d420ac35ad67cc8a44b1835ac331a49202","5d7daa84b3b6d137f68e34ef731602c5655f2b19","5d7e1c990da126ecdd713ea8b2307f2b1b0fa9f2","48a4e4bc15679533e4f8d97674fbcef29c3a4606","3b47ad08c2d42a45abe3d10ef96912397804db2d"],"title":"Detection of activity centers in cellular pathways using transcript profiling.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200025678"}

When testing interval hypotheses the null hypothesis $P$-values tend to be stochastically larger than standard uniform if the true parameter is in the interior of the null hypothesis. The new procedure starts with a set of $P$-values and discards those with values above a certain pre-selected threshold, while the rest are corrected (scaled-up) by the value of the threshold. Subsequently, a chosen family-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate MTP is applied to the set of corrected $P$-values only.

By combining this correction with bias correction on the log scale, we demonstrate that one achieves complete removal of second-order bias in odds ratio estimators in important special cases. We show how this approach extends to address bias in odds or risk ratio estimators in many common regression settings. We also propose a class of estimators that provide reduced mean bias and squared error, while allowing the investigator to control the risk of underestimating the true ratio parameter. We present simulation studies in which the proposed estimators are shown to exhibit considerable reduction in bias, variance, and mean squared error compared to MLEs.

These methods, however, are restricted to performing single-group analysis. The aim of the present work is to establish a penalized likelihood (PL) method for multi-group SEM. Our proposed method decomposes each group model parameter into a common reference component and a group-specific increment component. By penalizing the increment components, the heterogeneity of parameter values across the population can be explored since the null group-specific effects are expected to diminish. We developed an expectation-conditional maximization algorithm to optimize the PL criteria. A numerical experiment and a real data example are presented to demonstrate the potential utility of the proposed method.","inCitations":["9cb7a5ccf08426cc2bb2c576ad2d477221f3142c"],"title":"A penalized likelihood method for multi-group structural equation modelling.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12130"}

This model can be used to compare groups of time series in terms of the patterns of stochastic variation and to estimate the covariate effects. We focus our development on locally stationary time series and propose the covariate-indexed locally stationary setting, which include stationary processes as special cases. We use smoothing spline ANOVA models for the time-frequency coefficients. A two-stage procedure is introduced for estimation.

One common analysis applied to scRNA‐seq data involves detecting differentially expressed (DE) genes between cells in different biological groups. However, many experiments are designed such that the cells to be compared are processed in separate plates or chips, meaning that the groupings are confounded with systematic plate effects. This confounding aspect is frequently ignored in DE analyses of scRNA‐seq data. In this article, we demonstrate that failing to consider plate effects in the statistical model results in loss of type I error control. A solution is proposed whereby counts are summed from all cells in each plate and the count sums for all plates are used in the DE analysis. This restores type I error control in the presence of plate effects without compromising detection power in simulated data. Summation is also robust to varying numbers and library sizes of cells on each plate. Similar results are observed in DE analyses of real data where the use of count sums instead of single‐cell counts improves specificity and the ranking of relevant genes. This suggests that summation can assist in maintaining statistical rigour in DE analyses of scRNA‐seq data with plate effects.","inCitations":["0a40b005e23cbe50e36b8db78148923cc8935cf8","c7e09f27cd8d9cc88812a074f86694c042e330ab","01e48f5b4673a502277b0650f744185275fc30db","7c5ff2ace4fa4d08a3252205873dc90174645a42","86ad0695623e8964d06d97dd88b8958b566751de","25f4fa4c8e9c4c1e7fafa3e16bae43f4b9980579","ae95eedc0a4281a6f99b7f0e3cd712ad6bfaae43","0057deed2c13afc288a6936f1c6aaeb4fea55dd4","b2e4afcea95a65cf4769472654dfdb0d418bf4de","ba0452a487f67e7c233967f4c5b56d1c786631b0","99d71994dfa8e31b9708f4b168eaa128cdc610aa","08be7b1cca8e851e432a132087e78d22aee5e717","7aea2d69dcc70da89c79bf6e94549b91f58965d0","13c933e5bd0beb167c2be15e2c2478f5f22f57e0","75b3520ff79d60e71d2a5b693fa7283fd176f5af","dab01003b597446eec535eadea3a213c4232909f","13005147965349cd6de72fe5b3d78013d1bd8427","a632b14583343c35f917890334f0e76718f6f19c","63a7fa0f7be63bc0409f1b119d01901430262c6c","7393588c8218784ab7c612207533bc77d04f49cf","4679ae0a35441ad659b2caa8a83f6e9d37f3d980","bc0acb192ddc74f269dd09b40a8c0154a3a8acb0","755b48a3a9743b394c0d2f6034ce004873835eb0","64f98eeb17d21f0a1cbb1196c0b35c470527f08e","b8ce412d8818a1eae73933fc5f6daf4925d4ac72","87585df3e01ed2a2a5a66ece909313887f6b02da"],"title":"Overcoming confounding plate effects in differential expression analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw055"}

Compared to traditional tissue-level bulk RNA-seq data, single cell sequencing yields valuable insights about gene expression profiles for different cell types, which is potentially critical for understanding many complex human diseases. However, developing quantitative tools for such data remains challenging because of high levels of technical noise, especially the \"dropout\" events. A \"dropout\" happens when the RNA for a gene fails to be amplified prior to sequencing, producing a \"false\" zero in the observed data. In this paper, we propose a Unified RNA-Sequencing Model (URSM) for both single cell and bulk RNA-seq data, formulated as a hierarchical model. URSM borrows the strength from both data sources and carefully models the dropouts in single cell data, leading to a more accurate estimation of cell type specific gene expression profile. In addition, URSM naturally provides inference on the dropout entries in single cell data that need to be imputed for downstream analyses, as well as the mixing proportions of different cell types in bulk samples. We adopt an empirical Bayes' approach, where parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm and approximate inference is obtained by Gibbs sampling. Simulation results illustrate that URSM outperforms existing approaches both in correcting for dropouts in single cell data, as well as in deconvolving bulk samples. We also demonstrate an application to gene expression data on fetal brains, where our model successfully imputes the dropout genes and reveals cell type specific expression patterns.","inCitations":["c7140379ab3c2fead124710173f7ddb4744acab2","4bfaf182fe962e668c473a66edb0ebc0ad37a481","0cc5bfe8bb02e3ac4b00e3744a733163320de16d","d5c9240f72b6dd8965e282aee16af26ef29294b4","4cb6e0d3e3110fd6e93b82ce169f0c4447fef699","e9a2c22414ff04fc5fa2e17e2ccfa2224d552ad3","4be8378ed2dcfee8c505230d0805caf0ca27b809","e0c9bb8edd3a2a46b0771b51568627e231772a15","a2c2403d208f36d32363b11329250fd390d952d5","4b2c214a660dfe9e4b7df65670a981f9da650e1b","156e61436aaa79c371ccf91b96a057afa2236377","626959070641556b463369c21cc2d72e9a20888e","34c62363672395c732c89123382b185a4c943178","8b3efa1c1149c4ad830cbffd862c06c4d0b9e89c","13005147965349cd6de72fe5b3d78013d1bd8427","b46ecfda7d6a395827ae4a8e83c506f19906c877"],"title":"A Unified Statistical Framework for Single Cell and Bulk Rna Sequencing Data.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1110"}

It is shown by simulation that substantial gains in power can be attained if there is a subgroup by treatment interaction.","inCitations":["b12201f5d03d3630a02b0ce656d9a4b666d5739c","2acc2be12d6447d1c3df6430fc93c46d81593a16","136608b41f97c4b29408d46e7ccf3be189eeecb8","d78e2c7a365d79e7b27e035b1fd82c2601c1cbd3","9ed358460366370058c3dbbf5d257c25d7137535","43f3098c5acf1dc411450224ac0e5c4489a48d20","b1de71a6e86c1b727e43110eeda1caeef487c140","2d978be4ab99b4924083de721f9e81ee71c212e2","a1d2695eaf063513ace25c7c3096155ecf126912","79c39981749c817cccdafb841b8fc72d76b3ffe5","9b2a1097244f1f8e48c2db4e063c69bffbb652ca","6be61362217e586fef25eb6e40b68d4b8c73521e","9410df4d627406ae750f539913ad28ebc2e75dd3","7208a0c4ab5e65c1ffa168dca813fdba28378968"],"title":"Population enrichment designs: case study of a large multinational trial.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.554129"}

The selection phase may involve a choice between competing treatments or different dose levels of a drug, between different target populations, between different endpoints, or between a superiority and a non-inferiority hypothesis. Clearly there can be benefits in elapsed time and economy in organizational effort if both phases can be designed up front as one experiment, with little downtime between phases. Adaptive designs have been proposed as a way to handle these selection/testing problems. They offer flexibility and allow final inferences to depend on data from both phases, while maintaining control of overall false positive rates. We review and critique the methods, give worked examples and discuss the efficiency of adaptive designs relative to more conventional procedures. Where gains are possible using the adaptive approach, a variety of logistical, operational, data handling and other practical difficulties remain to be overcome if adaptive, seamless designs are to be effectively implemented.","inCitations":["c8c6bb4e0bd06c2a0341a199312bf2358fb4257b","62a574e28e231097e58677c33316d55173ff7f9e","a96d794c159b66907b7e12d590d417c9c8dedd01","4cdc50cab6e50b688e9930274904334a356553a1","ec1ae9447600999fe3778cae2eda8a7daabab6d4","a17b27a04f5305c0e01d4ecc25f61ddd29c3f372","d6a92b0ef49612445b3887225e08140de2ea186d","b1afc0437435bab5b3ef9025dbc044468368f748","e89950113c5f4681fc07ffb71961958c5aa6587e","f0a90c2e6c1ffff5b3924a621cc2e74973cef70e","5645b9dcbb83fce9b2c66b30fd5e44d8bc6279c4","6090cd633287d03244acf8d2e33184a26d8ce50f","3475c38d0c8be17c5ba606ce96dab88016bf10e9","f7d726451029f8717100cd6119f9ad328b4cd173","1bd38ff15657d58eeaf5f390625f426fa52599ac","7839f3dfcd2b694f3e2a58e8397b11d6b2ca56e7","066b36429d6d2a63303cc92185d93a20e463adc9","258332c136fcda9e80c72a973aa1dff87401f568","f149fda4f643c787dc8c0fa58ff4051f55bc1e22","0fafb102d1aa98ba51d10df69f17a1f6c5c602c6","41b40c56f69b571e481571c042396cf687ba775c","f9e56361c5805d5f4d349f0f0557f11e061a33c5","053087da8d0801164102b4bdc39c8e4d81d99a48","79c39981749c817cccdafb841b8fc72d76b3ffe5","a107a4fffa5c5c0ebd70a3d676097f291887fc5a","ef1fd8a4558e335888a991eb30509d52ec5a9fbe","d1633d91c23134fcfaf07bb537e63d374e1e2382","18cec532f61a57783ed08efcc57a4da87a406c35","76a909b5b7f440c1db47c9fa41a23b34fab80c19","144ec205004a866afa612ad26020bbd43f3afb4d","d7ac7e551c522f1848d5b905fe5b8fa4b9719586","9ee0f54acf2f4a7844dd75c72dada48d88be5718","7208a0c4ab5e65c1ffa168dca813fdba28378968","1b1c9851e3e4e97e1c156e36f015e1f07e288fc9","a2a1ca1f48afe8fde3d165e767205ce8a35b5a02","f97430875ea3ba8e2cb1f1a0cf17f2c5f1acb28e","17fd6bb17c6ad0715e9fbc1ac63fac86400bc0a2","842d709614b892f3cfb21179e3592a1b7918f45c","4ed2e6071affbea09687274e32358013fc8a2532"],"title":"Adaptive seamless designs: selection and prospective testing of hypotheses.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701645215"}

We address the problem of sample size determination between two independent groups for unequal and/or unknown variances when both the power and the differential cost are taken into consideration. We apply the well-known Welch approximate test to derive various sample size allocation ratios by minimizing the total cost or, equivalently, maximizing the statistical power. Two types of hypotheses including superiority/non-inferiority and equivalence of two means are each considered in the process of sample size planning. A simulation study is carried out and the proposed method is validated in terms of Type I error rate and statistical power. As a result, the simulation study reveals that the proposed sample size formulas are very satisfactory under various variances and sample size allocation ratios. Finally, a flowchart, tables, and figures of several sample size allocations are presented for practical reference.","inCitations":["ba01c6ec9dfd3380a66771f8c3638eac3eba6c80","89c84096110e3bbbe88cd829238a348b8c139902","1750192688b7dcc30ec74ae454c9ae455f7468ee","755d7ef37518b8038933c8409ee0080a35505706","bf9fb112a906314f4c1e60edb593d819b274b05a","71464586657391fb45d7afecddcb9441992f90f5"],"title":"Sample size planning with the cost constraint for testing superiority and equivalence of two independent groups.","doi":"10.1348/000711010X512408"}

Due to potential approximation bias, particularly for the estimation of rare events such as some adverse drug reactions, the conventional method is considered inferior to the exact methods based on binomial distributions. In this paper, we compare two existing exact approaches-beta binomial (B-B) and normal-binomial (N-B)-through an extensive simulation study with focus on the case of rare events that are commonly encountered in medical research. In addition, we implement the empirical (\"sandwich\") estimator of variance into the two models to improve the robustness of the statistical inferences. To our knowledge, it is the first such application of sandwich estimator of variance to meta-analysis of proportions. The simulation study shows that the B-B approach tends to have substantially smaller bias and mean squared error than N-B for rare events with occurrences under five percent, while N-B outperforms B-B for relatively common events. Use of the sandwich estimator of variance improves the precision of estimation for both models. We illustrate the two approaches by applying them to two published meta-analysis from the fields of orthopedic surgery and prevention of adverse drug reactions.","inCitations":["7fb1ace80ffa65427babea4f446617fca4115277","421f915900099da41f4c56d16de697522515a5ca","a96bb2197df494c262401753363a9602902044d9","0ed5a90a2a40f96bea6e20328e4607b7f6df90a4"],"title":"Meta-analysis of Proportions of Rare Events-A Comparison of Exact Likelihood Methods with Robust Variance Estimation","doi":"10.1080/03610918.2014.911901"}
