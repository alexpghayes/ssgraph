Our problem is posed as the estimation of the support of a distribution in three dimensions from a sample from that distribution, possibly measured with error. We propose a novel tube-fitting algorithm to construct such estimators. Further, we conduct a simulation study to aid in the choice of a key parameter of the algorithm, and we test our algorithm with validation study tailored to the motivating data sets.

After forming within-subject sums and differences, the usual tests, including those for carry-over effects and direct treatment effects, can be constructed using a multivariate analysis of variance. When the assumptions relevant to traditional analysis are in question, multivariate nonparametric tests based on ranks provide a realistic alternative. However, multivariate response gives rise to a wider class of hypotheses than is seen in crossover designs with univariate response. We discuss these hypotheses and formulate nonparametric tests for associated analyses.","inCitations":["285bc06f3d74cf8ca495b0bc3a1151e84212563a","d00597f1d16512fa625a279fe9e9924b513a4cbf"],"title":"Multivariate nonparametric analysis for the two-period crossover design with application in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543409308835045"}

However, in a variety of applications, some values of a covariate may be left-censored due to inadequate instrument sensitivity to quantify the biospecimen. When data are left-censored, the true values are missing but are known to be smaller than the detection limit. The most commonly used ad-hoc method to deal with nondetect values is to substitute the nondetect values by the detection limit. Such ad-hoc analysis of survival data with an explanatory variable subject to left-censoring may provide biased and inefficient estimators of hazard ratios and survivor functions.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe consider a parametric proportional hazards model to analyze time-to-event data. We propose a likelihood method for the estimation and inference of model parameters. In this likelihood approach, instead of replacing the nondetect values by the detection limit, we adopt a numerical integration technique to evaluate the observed data likelihood in the presence of a left-censored covariate. Monte Carlo simulations were used to demonstrate various properties of the proposed regression estimators including the consistency and efficiency.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe simulation study shows that the proposed likelihood approach provides approximately unbiased estimators of the model parameters. The proposed method also provides estimators that are more efficient than those obtained under the ad-hoc method. Also, unlike the ad-hoc estimators, the coverage probabilities of the proposed estimators are at their nominal level. Analysis of a large cohort study, genetic and inflammatory marker of sepsis study, shows discernibly different results based on the proposed method.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNaive use of detection limit in a parametric survival model may provide biased and inefficient estimators of hazard ratios and survivor functions. The proposed likelihood approach provides approximately unbiased and efficient estimators of hazard ratios and survivor functions.","inCitations":["8c6c8684a812f985aa6a1e6e0451ab0a97bb4b23","c2b16ff34219d2b6c602a492e8a6ce162b61f81a","7f47a88e77e3ac24fb9f37aee2cbd5bd145c3e9b","e9b5430a0a48501f68f77095c5ca35a5d56f4bbb","4fae2ae04a46b9da040aaa3c79ec55a410249440","962d229bea0322fa84e92b0cc1efa0682c277b8c","6a24df6b39ca40bcf87f8f2fe7738b900a3b0828","8a239ee031eac6f70c7af508173340a0e54b0da4","60e71bed6fff5f782b84434c61f61f72f4a37cad","65fdb5ba8f76f9595ed9fce7bdda6c9a55c69a50"],"title":"A Parametric Survival Model When a Covariate is Subject to Left-Censoring.","doi":"10.4172/2155-6180.S3-002"}

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), an alternative to data imputation methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration, is proposed for making inference in epidemiological models. It is a likelihood-free method that relies exclusively on numerical simulations. ABC consists in computing a distance between simulated and observed summary statistics and weighting the simulations according to this distance. We propose an original extension of ABC to path-valued summary statistics, corresponding to the cumulated number of detections as a function of time. For a standard compartmental model with Suceptible, Infectious and Recovered individuals (SIR), we show that the posterior distributions obtained with ABC and MCMC are similar. In a refined SIR model well suited to the HIV contact-tracing data in Cuba, we perform a comparison between ABC with full and binned detection times. For the Cuban data, we evaluate the efficiency of the detection system and predict the evolution of the HIV-AIDS disease. In particular, the percentage of undetected infectious individuals is found to be of the order of 40%.","inCitations":["a5c010a59b22b241bf857c67b5daea59af09f28e","7ddfa97c0c4112751d48909a15034473b46fab1f","8499532361ea4ceb06d0b4b10f2e11732aa9874e","3f794afdb7e4416bef94b21b4b9e1f6205c1ab9b","288a89dcd17bd8f6cafdbc2565553933fba3d296","4a82573ecae5865995a266b471fdb4bd81c6a0c5","bea0b94b4601bb961c43c701db09de7606a8d9aa","10c0d0c4823cf9b9a91b8f3c7307d1450b508de9","357186a16a74a77b7432f2397328e891c3f9e652","74fe324e59c4b99733071f95366cf2695a95c103","1e158aef1e9d2d819c29a229d3e67e2443713900","20147ab3d829183d621282d329bae2c45a283888","518fb9c36e772b703d625221b004a504dd0a8e36","7bfee2729a83b6cf00099480c8149223220cfdd4","128628997c4fdcd4b0e98863ff6f4c9dd1a27c63","0b25d4490d5a5b885fc4e42398b83bc0bd6a57ef","d0862fbb82b607b3c3dfb033aca4c0c51bd5f6c1","bc26d47f1ab87caeeacd3182156e64035bff9c25","991500ebcd3deac0ea48f5863701176201b89d02","5ecc16d3ac3b4756401cd14c12a61c525cbf958b","a8e388ffac75cd8320c6aef91a852c1d1985a0cb","19b0c9a5a11977f9c25ac6484e3e8c1955a2c67a","95432a229f476d3cecfa3b17133a0340965fcab9","983a1e41d2d4d94d7f808b9c3320f01644b8c2be","80036646e60872a3bd0d29158c45a2598cc4eb36","1b8ac0ed5697a791f6f71b141e939f2da5ec902d","e02f1782f324c975111bf25518090de7196b7571","35564f0081f585e3d062eb99c9c411b22138ec2b","5921e0308e71b0418ad0fb198c5fbbf824628066","5121cd2b2ca457f0f0d60cd4c2c57c79ff99b412","498c983b54496f26ee5ec72f2e6678fdef178b66","8d10fbcbb2a05b96c8b61e715c6084b90c1d431a","a04908007ec2cbacbc9ba68bb74bcbaeaf853c86","c68a9826df6be6f496b03ee519eef5e534ac9a75","a63e96a4f0a14c2ffba44e411a3e7b40bac95767","12f61ccb3a55af9e5840d606fc26f7cdbf442c06","0bf217a89806398e7a716757b51fc595b8d6e713","99be905378c797c56e40d6f52d2ba3917ed58613","01d1549c654d31000041d2823b45b1c0d5400ec7","70d0c4cca7686e4212cf6e65aa3fecb0c6783d87","8badd2a020ccb215a02cda4dcbc206d17c548092","0fed9b21851602a6035dcf2147e0815b4d263d10","51deebbda5ceacfc3c46001c7bea176a12ffdcf8","5810b9e41214185ee022912fdc3f6be3845963fa","3e1ffcd15c004199e5e5c03c05fe1fe325358de5","abbaca900656e8ff8bcbb23b323eb25a95dbc072","a1d1ed0b5673a3de9732f7e5e68fdb358dfca76c","fd079b567cadd9364d2305cc44edfa92ef93b7c5","e973badc42197b438921e77bedf083a66de6e9c0","54758a38cd2ff6dc88bf227d474e072ceb5b5de8"],"title":"HIV with contact tracing: a case study in approximate Bayesian computation.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq022"}

Traditional statistical analyses have relied mainly on mean firing rates over some epoch (often several hundred milliseconds) that are compared across experimental conditions by analysis of variance. Often, however, the time course of the neuronal firing patterns is of interest, and a more refined procedure can produce substantial additional information. In this paper we compare neuronal firing in the supplementary eye field of a macaque monkey across two experimental conditions. We take the electrical discharges, or 'spikes', to be arrivals in a inhomogeneous Poisson process and then model the firing intensity function using both a simple parametric form and more flexible splines. Our main interest is in making inferences about certain characteristics of the intensity, including the timing of the maximal firing rate. We examine data from 84 neurons individually and also combine results into a hierarchical model. We use Bayesian estimation methods and frequentist significance tests based on a nonparametric bootstrap procedure. We are thereby able to conclude that a substantial fraction of the neurons exhibit important temporal differences in firing intensity across the two conditions, and we quantify the effect across the population of neurons.","inCitations":["7f57ad31bd9b6f103877b553469190eb18db0578","320e5a30ab2ab7973154bd56059665cdd420cd0c","f444a34bc4dfb91698eb49d7e7bbca67f74a2110","fafc2f080a33164c3cccdc5a41b32fef736a0687","66a137df2f48329ab1988eb4bb729b2486a16cd6","11a4b1704243d835d6ccc684bf1987769e2c61a1","628f62195957203ef763be7dc35b47814eff39e4","006a34dcdfc63c5b7a2cf4d0b76cecedbb4b93d9","cbbccb2cfb69d4a4db0de6ad70eed50e54e78cb3","67c45802c5e3cd4ff13708c64ac35ef97bb4d20a","a6957beb9bcef62d3d29bf9dce0d2d250018a3ac","364597f31ae141e8caf1efc4fe5fcd2fcaeb8610","b6b830ee5a9727018b194cd0af430b8420a8ba59","8cc324efed4f574136bf25997fa97467c018160e","e7ad1a6147998d9ad468d31d6a99d1a8d21edd37","4e5e0335247e077dc26496960cd172c205885151","2721c8fcb683734bba238a606f0bce63dd242e5c","715236267451422beea24ede9bc65c52c2d8928b","2a94fc830b353f2e157327333ba24f7569ce3adc","f24141ae05f29fb913d95235795c9bc98b9b2fda","c018b9e851faa741342e87e8bedd74df7f44bee0","7c716d273c95e4a80b9828b5d1585b44f99040e3","28cd57afa9089d1cc5274f97434cde8565e01524","cac093d8643807e0951c7c701b99ca6a6447602f","451a85d2965f07249fbe39661a60bcc81f132327","4d9a643c79d87074689dfe2518a1b32ede9b98b9","1a4fb91c37b7d4b61e5838941d7986277f816857","816b8d64952bd4f84baebcf829e3c1b26eb5630a","657cdc822ea422dcc6ff807abc8d0b721c3d73bd","15d39dd1ec8d71b17ea10909202b33b95c847f1a","3047a9ac2ab530274c00399658a1bde2dc5cb6fc","8fda1a4f86351898a5468ef51092700b202c49e3","8b3e7eff6866d0cc266c18d30ab077f2d2189fe8","52e32b822f705740abd2c0cd822536e8d1feae4d","2d47a21b461a3a2d97ced386d365b287be0cf7e3","72a5e07b70f234d298e241bc702e17ce40b08b65","9e7a1ba586dcfe9764e2f5142774df940600d491","ed4470af7621a6b49991ffa8b68cdc2eed1b1e10","ca84d41ef87bcd30d354b88567a7470d0d040aba","1cfe7f7b82ecf8442f4cea46ae3cc43d5363f598","11c6fe453e23c45477cb471c28a96b57d157e0ad","09552a213706eba94547902d001e5c1743d4776f","782d4a1a2792d834cca23196709da30e11ca2077","5e7842cc134d5d63bc82995e4a386ef90f6bd31d","994cfcdf7cf3e2b697b6ab8578b9846a4635d164","322a58a6619f1437f32ab41a7ae86f5dd43d3fc1","a2f65d1a7525242cbf49433eb4f47a3b4072f774","a349f8fa173fe04e4c6e6615c16c1fe200422402"],"title":"Statistical analysis of temporal evolution in single-neuron firing rates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.1.1"}

This situation arises, for example, in epidemiology where surveys or study questionnaires consisting of a large number of questions yield a potentially unwieldy set of interrelated data from which teasing out the effect of multiple covariates is difficult. We propose a method that addresses these problems for categorical covariates by using, as its basic unit of inference, a profile formed from a sequence of covariate values. These covariate profiles are clustered into groups and associated via a regression model to a relevant outcome. The Bayesian clustering aspect of the proposed modeling framework has a number of advantages over traditional clustering approaches in that it allows the number of groups to vary, uncovers subgroups and examines their association with an outcome of interest, and fits the model as a unit, allowing an individual's outcome potentially to influence cluster membership. The method is demonstrated with an analysis of survey data obtained from the National Survey of Children's Health. The approach has been implemented using the standard Bayesian modeling software, WinBUGS, with code provided in the supplementary material available at Biostatistics online. Further, interpretation of partitions of the data is helped by a number of postprocessing tools that we have developed.","inCitations":["6c46640d240f0cae6d77b2699b4cd4da61b16644","2b9c6ececc8ef009409f65cc74d738002918467c","022eb9d3d432f346face3758141d6de0ac1c7694","4f08f4786039e82b0157282ab24b3164c91a9a3a","76de9f8fca83937a5a7e01231043c9b5b1d2e452","a83e529d5350e39d5b53cad4e1217317524c2bc5","3b76bffb915e5070f20772ee507820526903907d","9fd2f01ad9a3cdfdd30d8e19c4f63fc6ced86395","57e9d38ef7d07742fc4ec3ac3d2c24012ebd10ce","59d8b667181ea4120bb0bde8cda523e6b315c66c","9f251df368f7b4f65b4c103cfb7bb827d8c36ebf","0952011dd79a1be03f49497e5d305a760c609b68","58bc2b52dbd9f868e96b2241185318959fe559da","e3a24122e113dadedfa2b569be090a90995edf72","3297af21d721238a3e5ef8bf84db23acf72dca5b","1af15b10dee8977fe85ccfc6e9d5b935cf4f8d03","38e1d800dc443e21cc66423897ef72f74c056ab1","a8697b6a48d72d7309e9d7c5670a4dc6ddc4574f","fa763994ac085b7f843609b4161ccba227ed39d7","c58fff0e8dddb656150d9bdfb9deea0d69234acf","1450e143176fe413df20c88befb1b0d898a8510d","6c363404e75d760dfa97e002017ed61656713860","c1b29d6220e9d7d7a244e3c60f020204b66326bd","d2999cf1564dbb4dbcf631fae52101bcfd6e0fd1","147bef63010372a42441759cac2aad5f07ed2a68","9259b865856f333ab0eb89a1ef2dbd621c6cb008","723220839f891a76d686eb704a532f4b0c7a4f16","df8a4ffa620bb10a0a3e13c8d68b73491e0f39ad","dcd9b4a26797f4bc6f1cde00bfcf13e966fa0b0f","48c092f202e0e9de8123f8f65a9b4f87f2aa973b","5aca0355d74eedbe08574be078ccd8f402f005e1","85f96424bbe60dbbc339f276ce2108a0f430ac24","a5ee611ea39313bb20d7bdf346d0c0c34c5331f4","c14f60e1daf4c04e4f4addd1fcae809a26c8c484","e81fea928b659e05d32f64033b371732bd122d03","192afc74f853d2fd11b0fa2443c235c21a8f2078","c0f80b6587bb23b56d8da8b258df36e767a76bf4","4c376d09d28f753ea11b2645f26b227cfc94ea1d","f2c1ec7b27a0c285f0710d8cb952c13242ad254a","46290960edb7b976121154909478939cf7cbd225","a01149db7e2d77b59e90d6f8cd4033e7e30b3a9b","c51d28920a50ba4ba8c022a8d5b379114a61cf64","a4c5c13cf2585a60b3dd38a5f9bbefe7de775a0e","7974def84c1ee70b204a4cced718f14f314a34a1","7f22aac17dc9ee275d7278c510a4858cf58e1cd4","01496ca449d1bf6c095a3008167145cf69fdc23c","2391bc87b8912c32b00d409d114b84ebe0435b1c","e8301dff0bfc1193bc3a290525c150a493b4cb43","c70f0da2de6609072820695705c47c40d22d6bfb","223d76a1a0a070829af29a05c3f419297f234ce6","f8cdfbd6a8680b67ceec9650ac39e3e6c6e1b856","d8a1800277e27bf07ef8216e528898426736caa0","1844a5a45cc571d78fd2de70bdaa5cbe70396bb6","d34cb998e7004d0c7f9a6f0c6e5148286f086ac2","e1f811a8707b99d8919d2136315240192bdbc543","7ecaf25ecc1cafa2c81fb6e41b5f21c8c429e5e1","d45b54d2c5ab67282815b2355af1b982d387e70a","2548a0de345883730f48e95a44cf85522ed12101","9ff052746dfa612bcc026f707ec7e1a14dc175d8","ce0a7936fa56f59209f6ae70dd7dea25da6cf8c5"],"title":"Bayesian profile regression with an application to the National Survey of Children's Health.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq013"}

Several recent articles have shown the close relationships between these methods. We explain why the IPP intensity function is a more natural object of inference in presence-only studies than occurrence probability (which is only defined with reference to quadrat size), and why presence-only data only allows estimation of relative, and not absolute intensity of species occurrence. All three of the above techniques amount to parametric density estimation under the same exponential family model (in the case of the IPP, the fitted density is multiplied by the number of presence records to obtain a fitted intensity). We show that IPP and Maxent give the exact same estimate for this density, but logistic regression in general yields a different estimate in finite samples. When the model is misspecified-as it practically always is-logistic regression and the IPP may have substantially different asymptotic limits with large data sets. We propose \"infinitely weighted logistic regression,\" which is exactly equivalent to the IPP in finite samples. Consequently, many already-implemented methods extending logistic regression can also extend the Maxent and IPP models in directly analogous ways using this technique.","inCitations":["045a3ac9c1e7eac73455db045b90084f976fce59","a61197fcd550be44687f9b2e7b194577fc42f9b1","78056225210363e6cf46a93c3b45be25008d7df1","b89eb7154615e2dae5738714fa1bc2e9b8dc5dfd","bba5b1793c3a3ddc51b171dff323d048406764fe","c521eb47381035cf97bb5db82194f944af7226e8","2d287d6a83d6fe216caa8cf56e52ddaebe97a308","3f3ad7983c2944225539f5987967ef20d33b80d3","3f1620503128dc16f45d20b388f9281b4b7f7622","a085edb4e186f43b58039fa29f1f389b60f2aa9b","e72b8581c93ae9a358d55a6d9c3533759a0c9831","80dc7ef4c900cd59ae3ae6923ab94fedcf3286ec","fc90927290750be5084ff186d4b7e96f855ed8b0","71301b23a8ac68143278dff8484e20f8c884b3a2","a2db472d8269684645e7db5bb6c137dd86ecdca6","3c282527c0f4bde960b8ea60d0ff2c79bcfb2166","ac2d021be7c3161e286aa03f8ef6059e8a78bb94","21b9a1ede2444da6a12b39d2985220e3a0f3ccf8","bcff472506773764d8ec6ec4b462e02a113dd40d","52f59cb85494cd116a09f73f1e4a46c97e747224","7f71b0afec9460564df7b00c27e4e46e576e057f","c0b9f36aa015765bd29224fa3e24dfc74186d1c3","9b02d429c81881df6252c356db9d3c8129f59842","3b52d3bdf2b2f42f06ed2eb8a2b9e09b5efceca9","3d5f3db7b73e2d4818a10f1835faca9366adb4f7","a5456bc8ec2bd0eab0f31e2d6fe79dc2e52c96d7","4ce7ec015d2561ecfed7a3c0b0f082fcb15c5a69","b5c979eb403334b9139cd857d97d769816b4ed33","0e57b8a885a8e963e7fa3c2823c72e9d6ef4c5dc","927cab0ea342dc79dd9d16f48095a4ec92abe6fd","7df86ad505d2de29e1b769acb00fe984254722c6","56f6cfd0fa4a36a1978b3afd56d8b1d6c74addff","b193fa02868032f244529c43c638a4930d534bff","66d20602ee6dbad893548fd7921f5ee3785f3d29","2cb71c490843400b22eb437b9979b48d346afe41","172051a475364100ea2862227252ec8d94ca9ee2","1c09f539a07e92c3e802531a49a2f8cbea619ab2","453dc64e121e46381d614d87fabcbbeb17ed45f3","3663711745a4033145316b7448b15d1bef274228","83c6aa37067209fa7b2efb2ea76ab382ed925ba6","377fdfe8212ff9899c70cba2a0e3807843dacf2e","1d14023ad57a243ae370348a0c15f6c7a1d1c4e5","ee9501cd2d0915fa9d21d591e07ab1fe9521e0a7","ac5e84b9d86c4e0a984cb75c469cf798148d7a0d","553cdad1ab9dbc3139b36e884696689c708dfdee","3632745550b8cabdb074fa3745691009f538d57e","7d1d840d651bb45d67410e858b7dc72c47ef4746","4efca1e7c63be22a8df0b920bfb5c9a87ea801e2","106978e75a413e2d63dd9c692483e02e0d86d934","f02b1a45bfc77b333f3051eafef921427d065b35","4b4e82deba588d72bfd08b6ccaf23ea0f04cf375","58d5ebec52b2b37060f98be3c162f8518a7fed29","0243841a660a1a26de93093875dd802b8a8a19be","e4c10ad56670e85e78de8267ccf12cf9dabd5e75","47496760c5edf8e672291998bf221753a6ced84c","13c87c3c7284b7e6aa9448672a2cecd44b5307e6","c4f1377c0984590d91d5ed2339c273097d8dbbe2","b28d66158cbab954d1f739bc50f2ebccd59bb9e6","ad21ff619001ba0ffd1e30d55b67362c210b2963","763cc4cdf7d07a0d2efe3a2af51143a2440982cc","ee268cbc4c3142d3ca0501610878e018265f8a0f","fad899822e45f4456f076a077aeeaf75de5ad629","94107ff14a9d3b61407ad182f5db4956bebe0959","e0c43cc86bdb0401d9a392dd0e49f7a353144f60","f2799c7b8ff7e2c0ff68d6b4c2442a405e5e481e","06ea52bf0da1c01c17d8687e9c51716e5cfb377b","1e1b0a9566400dd21c2a6b2569a19cf70fa5a12b","2e4fffc02db0e346fe0393b585158aae49168b12","9cc250995705084f38257a1ba07681a24c5f6bf1"],"title":"Finite-Sample Equivalence in Statistical Models for Presence-Only Data.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS667"}

In this paper we investigate sample size requirement for a scenario frequently encountered by practitioners: All enrolled subjects participate in the pre-intervention phase of study, but some of them will drop out due to various reasons, thus resulting in missing values in the post-intervention measurements. Traditional sample size calculation based on the McNemar's test could not accommodate missing data. Through the GEE approach, we derive a closed-form sample size formula that properly accounts for the impact of partial observations. We demonstrate that when there is no missing data, the proposed sample size estimate under the GEE approach is very close to that under the McNemar's test. When there is missing data, the proposed method can lead to substantial saving in sample size. Simulation studies and an example are presented.","inCitations":["cef4bdbc56281a8a0b4b58b8f465188a37b0ce39","d58aeb036f00a681425766b3ba9da963f0c060d4","69ff9027a752325c888342bfb50a08bec7c54d94"],"title":"A GEE approach to determine sample size for pre- and post-intervention experiments with dropout","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2013.07.037"}

This spatial variation is a partial driver of health inequalities between rich and poor communities, and it is of interest to determine the extent to which these inequalities have changed over time. Therefore in this paper we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the spatio-temporal pattern in smoking incidence across Glasgow between 2000 and 2013, which can identify the changing geographical extent of clusters of areas exhibiting elevated maternal smoking incidences that partially drive health inequalities. Additionally, we provide freely available software via the R package CARBayesST to allow others to implement the model we have developed. The study period includes the introduction of a ban on smoking in public places in 2006, and the results show an average decline of around 11% in maternal smoking rates over the study period.","inCitations":["428e347830c7ceb639ac088d37a66385305be68b","c0b3e35bb3cff113aa0a1a1bbfeadd5206b07f3c","00f8e22eca2302af43055b1bcc9fbed5b5bfc73e","b7ed8059362b4e0ad3fe2d5834adc2e0cfe54460","e7706e6f6895cdee68f47170a720042d3f988178","5c22e393e924a6262bfd6ed70815f2bac7ff11ef"],"title":"Quantifying the Spatial Inequality and Temporal Trends in Maternal Smoking Rates in Glasgow.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS941"}

In social networks, this means that individuals form multiple types of relationships with the same person (e.g., an individual will not trust all of his/her acquaintances). Statistical models for these data require understanding two related types of dependence structure: (i) structure within each relationship type, or network view, and (ii) the association between views. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework that parsimoniously represents dependence between relationship types while also maintaining enough flexibility to allow individuals to serve different roles in different relationship types. Our approach builds on work on latent space models for networks [see, e.g., J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.97 (2002) 1090-1098]. These models represent the propensity for two individuals to form edges as conditionally independent given the distance between the individuals in an unobserved social space. Our work departs from previous work in this area by representing dependence structure between network views through a multivariate Bernoulli likelihood, providing a representation of between-view association. This approach infers correlations between views not explained by the latent space model. Using our method, we explore 6 multiview network structures across 75 villages in rural southern Karnataka, India [Banerjee et al. (2013)].","inCitations":["47e3d050abb8736b16d6c72575edcde0d6ae0ca6","fd24124bd6f2323514cb117511b0d24bf3171769","3e5d6a8c443a485adacffdcb7f19a6438ae09a0c","b2f2f0d1213762e4fe74754ddc405730dd86c0f2","8dc557ae5ac86fa6b31f1646e95bbb03fb206e96","1c01dc5dc7e61adc28812d4d1ad0225d3439ca1b","9c893b64ad2b5aa169c39cec5a61ffeb1e0a2bb3","9e22c94e3cc72f8bc6d321d25c238bbbe5df4bda","f42e3434540dd63a53d87aff3ad77565a16b3d9f","f0c631a909891cff3e9aca93c317dac75c5730fe","ee440c0b4f46219c0e0c1559c768c1ec4d912c46","843ff8ced85d7e480c098fe31fd9110c206dbd92","6437da3f23e3331b6386d1e3ea06b30f648a72e0","224c783b473bc9d9568b09e3ff24ac6d122132ab","fa0932ce56408479a98b4c46f8e5cdff2ae338bb","b24ef7ffc9a7520f7b97ea0fb78193d539701081"],"title":"Latent Space Models for Multiview Network Data.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS955"}

To test the fit of the model, Lagrange multiplier tests of the assumptions of subpopulation invariance of the item parameters (i.e., no differential item functioning), the shape of the response functions, and three different types of conditional independence were derived. Simulation studies were used to show the feasibility of the estimation and testing procedures and to estimate the power and Type I error rate of the latter. In addition, the procedures were applied to an empirical data set from a computerized adaptive test of language comprehension.","inCitations":["44388e2dd16181972dce8a041c1ad12e082587d1","019543a6a10d0d750a29f71b533f0041e201355c","b5c816104e6d8240a4441e8514d71301b4f43e2d","2f55e670fd26d742a971fcebec82f9cf1875bc79","dbb83b274ed94c3094a14232b88ff66f4c805d54","de676a3a7031e126946f4b966509e23931892c22","846c4c005d9be122e2132e53cc0a3deada22696a","fc8f95a0bb85c6082d5194c01e67bae8843fe437","0cd55f14d94c02afc9d8b27c72c73d17e51bcb22","1a47d6fa4690fbee5164686a4a1d46c3eb5f1fcf","14704c3e8aa9b7e0687026a35289a62ad26e1331","38e0cada11b38dd19070b7688c56365bb4f9baec"],"title":"Marginal likelihood inference for a model for item responses and response times.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X481360"}

In this paper we study a parametric model which allows for dependence in terms of a parameter delta and a bias function B(t, theta). We propose a sensitivity analysis on the estimate of the parameter of interest for small values of delta. This parameter measures the dependence between the lifetime and the censoring mechanisms. Its size can be interpreted in terms of a correlation coefficient between the two mechanisms. A medical example suggests that even a small degree of dependence between the failure and censoring processes can have a noticeable effect on the analysis.","inCitations":["a26097e1d16c18dea5d969debfd87647963aded1","4ee0b172ff004b3849477bf644f2e16ed60a0409","dbc42c99b71ac91751d83abc8b9cc74986d377d7","5eae729a61466c9e231921632425bf042a4050ef","ef7bc7f541aff07fc06f0930175d7fba556b00a4","8d2d00cef73d86cdb7fa867444a306ed7e8acf52","35d75d7d198285cf8e122667f78c380bce29435f","d88380207ab5d351c62cbb6a633b6887b14f73aa","f118f381e2e02df8184651b4c5b90151169c6b8b","be8b531e71147b72426f721fad2e5d104e2512af","8c562295125b3f3755c072f4341f428f838a7033","de6a89f21bd5a6facca5564031d1486bd88a5d64","157fd204417e778d1bc04f518f7fc90bdcf24691","2df2ad71140925ff02967461ec590d188c1d6118","1e1e41f4593efcf6e0e26b1b2e377814900a1bd3","4ef1ad17c21c85461c5418680253dcb6f2ba5b7d","2e062484f7474551a69401fd16ce53467022170d","49bc09a9e562610b97f4e1ef632895f4ef0118b8","54c2767e68d62fd5d1a6fc2f1fa689273ce44e1e","5561d1e8c4377208ecd08f2276d8121d5d9c534d","5c5f3b3a34677b39a00579ffe60677218e554ab0","e4758802499ebddb9fc3fc695e9131e681c20a9a","4fb428f3136997a95a028cf77aea260856999343","5920a9384cea48b3b385e943d87cb6cb170e9f64","e677766e5a34f4fe49008866530fc4214536ad2e","a2fafd9ced880273320c2d1428de4c257a2f4b8b","30e575fbce864be687822f79a983031fe80969ae","95c85617a91c1388599ed125e9eddf5dbac0becc","724d728ada00edcbf90d61645f97dde74c077301","755072c44dfc021691c774008c25126dbf072d9b","e483706284d72c4df606582ffe76f14007cbaadd","e5677bdb414b8f58fc4cfd323380628d6e84ea75"],"title":"Sensitivity analysis for informative censoring in parametric survival models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxh019"}

We consider the likelihood of IBD data conditional on phenotypes and test the null hypothesis of no linkage between a marker locus and a gene influencing the trait using a score test in the recombination fraction theta between the two loci. This method unifies the linkage analysis of qualitative and quantitative traits into a single inferential framework, yielding a simple and intuitive test statistic. Conditioning on phenotypes avoids unrealistic random sampling assumptions and allows sib-pairs from differing ascertainment mechanisms to be incorporated into a single likelihood analysis. In particular, it allows the selection of sib-pairs based on their trait values and the analysis of only those pairs having the most informative phenotypes. The score test is based on the full likelihood, i.e. the likelihood based on all phenotype data rather than just differences of sib-pair phenotypes. Considering only phenotype differences, as in Haseman and Elston (1972) and Kruglyak and Lander (1995), may result in important losses in power. The linkage score test is derived under general genetic models for the trait, which may include multiple unlinked genes. Population genetic assumptions, such as random mating or linkage equilibrium at the trait loci, are not required. This score test is thus particularly promising for the analysis of complex human traits. The score statistic readily extends to accommodate incomplete IBD data at the test locus, by using the hidden Markov model implemented in the programs MAPMAKER/SIBS and GENEHUNTER (Kruglyak and Lander, 1995; Kruglyak et al., 1996). Preliminary simulation studies indicate that the linkage score test generally matches or outperforms the Haseman-Elston test, the largest gains in power being for selected samples of sib-pairs with extreme phenotypes.","inCitations":["11cafbf305a0d4e3cb2de79da53153bf34487da2","204ac6568693db0c4286b0b44305c0e1b404898a","7114a5ccf7664d75b6857a296577854cbca0fbb6","f01673762618b0607455c87b60da21cfb3f94a31","50b30c60793a572b537c3076e2ca4e1045546b98","c01d78fb8b58328e455a5adfcc56a02c47087a97","b913a74aa9840664bc7831cbefa4fa5f0c88a455","0fede382c50b5e6ffe030417776c6414b6226ca2","78831b161dbf0c4bbe950cd7fb9be2140ef13f74","0a66ec72dd9140b9869e6d2dc9a94ba367efbb2a","890a508fcf96b753f0c06cefb252b5e04b2fa170","178543b0d15360e5f3e9f53145f80085d2602d5c","4701b88ac3d8cd4166d80048e1029c320f7d055f","907e72b84c69893c274e2a1d4672a7f086441981","37628a5cf1de531538e9a0deaf976b53a905be1f","956baa3f91c9838e01703ac0eae7ac56dd5373e4","0d57ac30b6ca51da698f0bf0d17d586a8c88202e","ca5602db131f4be75a09744c89d2521204c7b278","d1b5d34c68147e70957ab5551c7ee5c12a99b12e"],"title":"A score test for the linkage analysis of qualitative and quantitative traits based on identity by descent data from sib-pairs.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.1.1"}

We obtain sharp lower and upper bounds on the required size, which is easy to compute. The upper bound is generally only slightly larger than the required size, and hence can be used to approximate the sample size. The lower and upper size bounds can be decomposed into two terms. The first term relies on the mean number of events in each group, and the second term depends on two factors that measure, respectively, the extent of between-subject variability in event rates, and follow-up time. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method.

But if the assumption of homogeneity is violated, the test for the row, column, and the interaction effect might be invalid or less powerful. Therefore, for planning research in the case of unknown and possibly unequal variances, it is worth developing a sample size formula to obtain the desired power. This article suggests a simple formula to determine the sample size for 2 x 2 fixed-effect ANOVA for heterogeneous variances across groups. We use the approximate Welch t test and consider the variance ratio to derive the formula. The sample size determination requires two-step iterations but the approximate sample sizes needed for the main effect and the interaction effect can be determined separately with the specified power. The present study also provides an example and a SAS program to facilitate the calculation process.","inCitations":["dec01e4934a3b72c84ce720792f9802e1496bd16"],"title":"On sample size calculation for 2x2 fixed-effect ANOVA when variances are unknown and possibly unequal.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X322853"}

Often we are interested in whether a new method can replace an existing invasive or expensive method, or whether multiple methods or multiple observers can be used interchangeably. Ideally, interchangeability is established only if individual measurements from different methods are similar to replicated measurements from the same method. This is the concept of individual equivalence. Interchangeability between methods is similar to bioequivalence between drugs in bioequivalence studies. Following the FDA guidelines on individual bioequivalence, we propose to assess individual agreement among multiple methods via individual equivalence using the moment criteria. In the case where there is a reference method, we extend the individual bioequivalence criteria to individual equivalence criteria and propose to use individual equivalence coefficient (IEC) to compare multiple methods to one or multiple references. In the case where there is no reference method available, we propose a new IEC to assess individual agreement between multiple methods. Furthermore, we propose a coefficient of individual agreement (CIA) that links the IEC with two recent agreement indices. A method of moments is used for estimation, where one can utilize output from ANOVA models. The nonparametric and bootstrap approaches are used for inference.

Motivated by the application of establishing a reference value in an inter-laboratory setting when outlying labs are present, we propose a local contamination model that is able to accommodate unusual multivariate realizations in a flexible way. The proposed method models the process level of a hierarchical model using a mixture with a parametric component and a possibly nonparametric contamination. Much of the flexibility in the methodology is achieved by allowing varying random subsets of the elements in the lab-specific mean vectors to be allocated to the contamination component. Computational methods are developed and the methodology is compared to three other possible approaches using a simulation study. We apply the proposed method to a NIST/NOAA sponsored inter-laboratory study which motivated the methodological development.","inCitations":["3903665dfb670cf0109136a0c5386182f6a6c6c2"],"title":"Bayesian Local Contamination Models for Multivariate Outliers","doi":"10.1198/TECH.2011.10041"}

Results of our simulation studies show that there is a serious consequence of large inflations of the false negative rate through large decreases of false positive rate in the use of the above joint test procedure in the final interpretation of the carcinogenicity potential of a new drug if the levels of significance recommended for separate tests are used. The inflation can be as high as 204.5% of the false negative rate when the trend test alone is required to test if the effect is statistically significant. To correct the problem, new sets of levels of significance have also been developed for those who want to use the joint test in reviews of carcinogenicity studies.","inCitations":["237c38eabc845633b98476b4c3d3e633ea2dd0e5"],"title":"Comparisons of false negative rates from a trend test alone and from a trend test jointly with a control-high groups pairwise test in the determination of the carcinogenicity of new drugs.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2018.1473874"}

last fifty years. The K-means method is first introduced, various formulations of the minimum variance loss function and alternative loss functions within the same class are outlined, and different methods of choosing the number of clusters and initialization, variable preprocessing, and data reduction schemes are discussed. Theoretic statistical results are provided and various extensions of K-means using different metrics or modifications of the original algorithm are given, leading to a unifying treatment of K-means and some of its extensions.

Recently, the method of higher criticism (HC) was shown to be an effective means for determining appropriate decision thresholds. Here, we study HC from a false discovery rate (FDR) perspective. We show that the HC threshold may be viewed as an approximation to a natural class boundary (CB) in two-class discriminant analysis which in turn is expressible as the FDR threshold. We demonstrate that in a rare-weak setting in the region of the phase space where signal identification is possible, both thresholds are practicably indistinguishable, and thus HC thresholding is identical to using a simple local FDR cutoff. The relationship of the HC and CB thresholds and their properties are investigated both analytically and by simulations, and are further compared by the application to four cancer gene expression data sets.","inCitations":["b4f9858e0c3239eedc2461af96d935cc5b501eb1","a4c86508ed132564eac24ab42b84fa0f726cf1d9","985372c3e46b475d583a21383409122304c43c98","85f0dacff73163b36e0278bbff1f67fabff7ebd9","ec45def58786a861bf750da815a73582c48d470b","d829e9312f5bbfbd1e1c7234e00a4480c176bd5d","41396b7b669b0e438a0b39715a1a98fdf6abc9ee","bcf15c2c260517184b73321727f287fe0be92ebd","8738bd600849293da7257ca84568b332fa2aefcb","63b240df6cd4a35ff61550992909197756bd6a03","b38eeec1c63fed013262fe34286042d11bb96609","767a482a488b76b273b37f06b76d7345eea02098","84e70648f82e55782cc6280b311a9911d056dede","289dcb84b47e5a6ffbfa55a0d142cf23122e4eea","bc37cf1f0b7284ec8a4c9d3af6236f4a559b0214","d0e63b9434774aba01e9130bfeb9fd0720b5bf90","c1e6a52e6388890e29329023ce7408cf5bb6ca42","73030aad52b4f4cef82f7cd838a08fe7a593012a","7c9785b970fab4a4eebe1c1a746e76a5ae5d2b97","267d0e4cfbecf7206ceeb768af8dd54bbe57c15c","57b165b8f28233039f047133e9800a8a337fc7f7"],"title":"Signal identification for rare and weak features: higher criticism or false discovery rates?","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs030"}
