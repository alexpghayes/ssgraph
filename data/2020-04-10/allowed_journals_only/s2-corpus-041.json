In particular, we test for differentially-expressed genes in a microarray experiment. We wish to identify genes that are associated with some type of outcome, such as survival time or cancer type. We propose a new procedure, called Lassoed Principal Components (LPC), that builds upon existing methods and can provide a sizable improvement. For instance, in the case of two-class data, a standard (albeit simple) approach might be to compute a two-sample t-statistic for each gene. The LPC method involves projecting these conventional gene scores onto the eigenvectors of the gene expression data covariance matrix and then applying an L(1) penalty in order to de-noise the resulting projections. We present a theoretical framework under which LPC is the logical choice for identifying significant genes, and we show that LPC can provide a marked reduction in false discovery rates over the conventional methods on both real and simulated data. Moreover, this flexible procedure can be applied to a variety of types of data and can be used to improve many existing methods for the identification of significant features.","inCitations":["4509baaae3fa5f356394d65758ffe572f7fab116","910f5e1aac636423ed37b904012cb176b431709b","83952c3ae5d13b31bae6cdd08b9b9bacaf1093bb","491aae1d3efa02e3782e3916e8f0a5b30f1d62b5","60e7a083b8e68d97de733b7b7d4d30261890a249","6a32d002c5c72363350fe50e09c56c7d28063447","5cc815d7a19106c3c62c4baf186f2631aeeeab58","c8aeb16dfae342d559a8104c5508700bef486784","ba57281966bb1882969fa3312464aa9d69f8239b","fde8d2952c29a361326d2f2c0a01aacb2a59fe7a","0492014376b3c69e595d2a2c83f3eb1563deda46","85c0efdb8e5ad47e8fb9848499ca75b06953c17d","71272dce54a4692d88c1af2883f3ab15fcd757e8","a493bfed0327edfd5a6bea3c742b83e3c8a6d328","4d33f7b6fe8f072814622b191700caed689b4b91","454eeb6e0e462bbdc2f65d67902497c63f7283e7"],"title":"Testing Significance of Features by Lassoed Principal Components.","doi":"10.1214/08-AOAS182"}

Though many of the methods contribute to biological discoveries, inability to properly evaluate the novel techniques limits their ability to advance science. Because the underlying distribution of microarray data is unknown, novel methods are typically tested against the assumed normal distribution. However, microarray data are not, in fact, normally distributed, and assuming so can have misleading consequences. Using an Affymetrix technical replicate spike-in data set, we show that oligonucleotide expression values are not normally distributed for any of the standard methods for calculating expression values. The resulting data tend to have a large proportion of skew and heavy tailed genes. Additionally, we show that standard methods can give unexpected and misleading results when the data are not well approximated by the normal distribution. Robust methods are therefore recommended when analyzing microarray data. Additionally, new techniques should be evaluated with skewed and/or heavy-tailed data distributions.","inCitations":["603b6096ba33049a43e40e8999d0c1d572ddc9df","689128b7881914046359365a1700527c2456df65","29b3c8d7fb9a7c9fa3949ae9521fd15472f359da","f80e755445f89fd93dcda64afca6713bda53f24f","025166ef8d12f68d9ece82421fe8e156ef476329","ff16e165e84f5e6b09274fc8375932482ee5b9e6","331197fa3264de4e1dfa9749e89d31234dfef318","5b7c08f83184692203a6e5be8bc328750c7ac078","ab29a4431a3b6d60e8d884280a0469fc75911abc","1f5b8f72528b20a2a12ffd20f32367691f7af708","6e93e92a98e377e9b0ef300fcd31e26cfdfb2f4e","a11eb74bb589044c3d15aff7de8910e108d3e71b","80214d0a0c51d044ef4e95dd55d5a46004a45981","6eadbfb079a2a1d60ec9604c9997232872e86026","97e082fb908f708d264fe62fb2d1467abe116f33","0173afea50b1da19870c3524026271ee98f89e15","a7b94e89289629bc55306ffd7cda28de1d4ed4e5","714e5d8483e2e3177851f99b73bc1621988354b8","31031fb511b7d86b33ef824c37275c4b1e051957","bf468213c8802bfea7dbaf78ebb9f98dfe8ee195","8a6af30c7302fce9fa56b2a0576a4ff6c9349b86","2922dabcc7e203b641facfd9192d3efd292da568","687186174d2fb660e182edd489be50cbf649a4b3","6a41c4a508c056946cdb3b2f46be0c46e25e943d","546b119d4c4a766d5d3aeafbb214354e8aca79c4","37e41858a429f5fd6c008bc62f422de4d2c0e7ba","29c97b88d7c3dc42011311e952a4a12886e931df"],"title":"A note on oligonucleotide expression values not being normally distributed.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp003"}

The objective in such a problem is often two-fold: both to explore the association structures of multiple sets of measurements and to develop a parsimonious model for predicting the future outcomes. We study a unified canonical variate regression framework to tackle the two problems simultaneously. The proposed criterion integrates multiple canonical correlation analysis with predictive modeling, balancing between the association strength of the canonical variates and their joint predictive power on the outcomes. Moreover, the proposed criterion seeks multiple sets of canonical variates simultaneously to enable the examination of their joint effects on the outcomes, and is able to handle multivariate and non-Gaussian outcomes. An efficient algorithm based on variable splitting and Lagrangian multipliers is proposed. Simulation studies show the superior performance of the proposed approach.

Whether targeting protocols to match respondents' likely mode is an effective strategy remains unclear. For those without a clear likely mode, how the details about sequencing influence response rates, mode, field work effort, and potential response bias remain important questions. This article describes a targeted sequential design implemented in a 2016 mixed mode supplement with individuals ages 30 and older in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the longest running national panel study in the US (N=10,784). Respondents predicted to be likely to respond by web were invited to a web study and sent a paper copy after 6 weeks (web-first); those likely to respond by paper were also invited to participate by web but told that a paper copy would be sent shortly (signal-and-send). An embedded experiment measured the impact of the two protocols among a group of respondents with no clear likely mode (N=889). Over 40% of individuals with no likely mode are under the age of 40, and the group falls between the likely web and paper groups in terms of education and internet use and includes more women and single respondents. Compared to the likely web and paper groups, those with no likely mode had lower response rates and required more fieldwork effort. Among those randomly assigned, the signal-and-send protocol increased response over the web-first protocol from weeks 4 through 7. By week 16, both protocols yielded similar response rates (AAPOR 1 RR=71% vs. 68%, p=0.49), field effort (7.9 vs. 8.4 mean weeks, p=0.251), and distributions of respondent characteristics. Among those responding, cases randomized to web-first were more likely than those randomized to signal-and-send to respond by web (62.7% vs. 42.4% p<.001). We discuss implications for targeted protocols in mixed mode panel surveys.","inCitations":["49fbb1a6bf8a336cd9a5747be947c0568d77c7d2"],"title":"Use of a Targeted Sequential Mixed Mode Protocol in a Nationally Representative Panel Study.","doi":"10.1093/jssam/smx012"}

In recent years, the equivalence test has been used in assessing the analytical similarity between a proposed biosimilar product and a reference product. More specifically, the mean values of the two products for a given quality attribute are compared against an equivalence margin in the form of ±f × σR, where ± f × σ R is a function of the reference variability. In practice, this margin is unknown and is estimated from the sample as ±f × SR. If we use this estimated margin with the classic t-test statistic on the equivalence test for the means, both Type I and Type II error rates may inflate. To resolve this issue, we develop an exact-based test method and compare this method with other proposed methods, such as the Wald test, the constrained Wald test, and the Generalized Pivotal Quantity (GPQ) in terms of Type I error rate and power. Application of those methods on data analysis is also provided in this paper. This work focuses on the development and discussion of the general statistical methodology and is not limited to the application of analytical similarity.","inCitations":["2487edd533c3f5bcf0b314157f83b588d107b0d5","00b17200b92771aaa132d2d95165e3e8552e9ba3"],"title":"Exact test-based approach for equivalence test with parameter margin.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1265546"}

However, clinical trials of infertility treatments violate a fundamental condition of crossover designs, because women who become pregnant in the first treatment period are not treated in the second period. In previous research, to deal with this problem, some new designs, such as re-randomization designs, and analysis methods including the logistic mixture model and the beta-binomial mixture model were proposed. Although the performance of these designs and methods has previously been evaluated in large-scale clinical trials with sample sizes of more than 1000 per group, the actual sample sizes of infertility treatment trials are usually around 100 per group. The most appropriate design and analysis for these moderate-scale clinical trials are currently unclear. In this study, we conducted simulation studies to determine the appropriate design and analysis method of moderate-scale clinical trials for irreversible endpoints by evaluating the statistical power and bias in the treatment effect estimates. The Mantel-Haenszel method had similar power and bias to the logistic mixture model. The crossover designs had the highest power and the smallest bias. We recommend using a combination of the crossover design and the Mantel-Haenszel method for two-period, two-treatment clinical trials with irreversible endpoints.","inCitations":["57e5a457e226740376d3b5aa94e0d6fa3ab75167","c8035c64cc04a975625b99bcc73beeb958043df5","ea9058852901665434170791b7b9707b46948658","f5a892f1882029e5a5cafadbf4e9df27bb5c2d1f","a852736be46b2366b294e277db365010759a1804"],"title":"Practical approaches for design and analysis of clinical trials of infertility treatments: crossover designs and the Mantel-Haenszel method are recommended.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1674"}

Using data sets simulated to match six actual trials, I imposed several drop-out mechanisms, and compared the methods in terms of bias in the treatment difference and power of the treatment comparison. With equal drop-out in Active and Placebo arms, LOCF generally underestimated the treatment effect; but with unequal drop-out, bias could be much larger and in either direction. In contrast, bias with the MMRM method was much smaller; and whereas MMRM rarely caused a difference in power of greater than 20%, LOCF caused a difference in power of greater than 20% in nearly half the simulations. Use of the LOCF method is therefore likely to misrepresent the results of a trial seriously, and so is not a good choice for primary analysis. In contrast, the MMRM method is unlikely to result in serious misinterpretation, unless the drop-out mechanism is missing not at random (MNAR) and there is substantially unequal drop-out. Moreover, MMRM is clearly more reliable and better grounded statistically. Neither method is capable of dealing on its own with trials involving MNAR drop-out mechanisms, for which sensitivity analysis is needed using more complex methods.","inCitations":["c015f310785b59c90d1a742076d12fbf4b5c6d72","baf9faf195b03929b527d5fe741557d59d331606","b8870300d070d558d86b32bc27db084a34e5d037","f8cb906ddc1ca0bba2356334e92a1e76232eb287","45d0d66533f993be64c99f8d50ad3b280e4c47df","bc137cdf79be786f65fa8cbe0f0916a1733d6362","620bc6d3e15b2e5b252ef3b1f53c9148b6989148","44e703440969dcbc2aa5590f5e567a4a90766f5d","a053193948808ded16ec2affa53e3a515c295901","52990a07093cece9429e276279d4ea982aee19db","486bb4120f500e2ec1d00da9523ac2fdbceb36ca","b33d1e30c17db6676c2b2da3d5af9b55ec92b058","503447ad5db049f9d91334e65168945540468d37","229e123c46b3bf95c86f4e0c2b87123eec73d518","18990fa6c5c0fd9110311fe3616d36a7c77671c0","e8b02e631308428fa97500e09b6fb2ead9e8ee11","11cf83846b47e83897ed5763180923357c03371a","894a0c79cadaabea2899f3d33d4c499d73565d3a","cf210fa630b6a5af14495a37576eae5a76738f65","3f2a8dda4ff595658d70fc413cac5046f2ba3772","ce9ab32ab7251389997b91a6053874e36f26c735","b6529cc9a8a46338c941a62234fcaebba09163aa","2ad4b01d08ce4e45538ab2adc34dd43b32f41a1c","0de7533ff4e245fae19a1ca4c2846b6defa0451f","63e50cfdb3ff4629ee7fc9458ad7ed3cf8dd23a7","5cdb3e3cec1094c0098a27781357cd1e915c7eb9","007be0812ab1217f116723aee8c92646a6dee78d","5d29cbf39321310db7b7b57fed9a489161bc1db5","6e9b52a0934123433511e127fabca3e241b7ffd4","a657e724b6832082a09eacb456ea7c244fc8b5f7","224594aedb10026e706b5531c6a4ab7d8c4f3a20","574637eedf9be50ce009d5933f3696ceab52dadd","ca341bf56546e7a86d6a2fa2d9231f03778d407a","09d725a334f6eae98f0c5f6129f5ba64833946a7","9101fb0bd420706618e338787aba10dc47e866fa","233bb57838ef991286eb86a4841271c383ee5951","60a03c1cb246be14b8f42d4f263b1b204518347d","14d0fc0355ad245d3ab424b69fdd51fddd4c6719","3e3a08d209ca6b4e47f7c7458fef9ab999bd6c0d","22b30d4d268b1dd49e40c7bf323c488edb91f5f1","d6eb4ac74dfa8cfc4ad2d85e2db28fc80d45cca0","7c665175b668e67867cdee39fb7cec2ef37827ba","0a53577b11faf76dd82ed380992f9d1e06e7a310","310f49b5e2cfaeebe7be44bea6e89e07b0676d15","cf9ecac65805b16c17a8e5bf366cd77cc3b5abfa","00fa6456fbeebee60729dc1c6d3cd7e1d692e3f1","e8409c579f3603d71e32339b51dbab1a8fd580c4","7f49fd833f096f72b5e02a0682c2f7e8deabb084","88416c816349126dd45ce2e08eac89aba4efc7cb","4af8e6ff4e19bdbab5efafe134fbd6b525329371","3f95ad621c16979950835e3cf34cc4fd9e129a0f","82ca167d299eba50a04c557adc945f9679f87317","3f87826f731c62cce748cd4198b6a96b1542a7ba","107204e9a312f3a44f07db023140958d895b0d0f","fe251dacf56c05df7c47b67ee992dc9a298add5d","7ed6839e6d858773c669101f33393b4fc1b17ea3","da248e37465b04399b21563f4980a3c85d2e04bc","69b1bfd4c6fe5b4b69594daf264d64d427e16822","4ff5ed1767230f8a5d7f36421f7793644bf3ad9e","6dee1744237c92a91ea1974a97e167a4306bb069","a45cb66a9f53da89e09d99fc477f7018afbcc453","b801017523f650c691e36549b83fea24ee21b800","537bb31a9cbbf4d1541e79bed696b2f1353a69c0","a530f2ce7dbe5d629940f5f2fa81d195494d5167","f4eb0c75c721c27b24a26bb2aa64ae1e808af6bc","6fb88b86446e038dfb8d37a1b464a19c30260060","6273ec1d167fe7ea0b99f8ff7fde83aa0f986355","aacc2bafaeabb5b749e2c8925d58442cc2bb5cc1","b9c06b1faef9746e1f378fde34d7b22d88e736e6","39786109ef10e7963f5543de00910b12d7c842b0","328f67e475905140e4153ad05d90eedf1c5d6e12","eceaf83b665ac5ca2db8933414afc7d743eebf29","1e477a442b4dce2c360b2c4a4e20871a70b1f1c1","3573d4931991b500fbda504de4e471323b8c85ef","fc28b6d4996814dec9e1f34a6d9aa5504efb266d","85fe9dced2252ccf8bba0ad9f0c4a2ad9a9a869a","835bb32be62fc3fe3b130ac224dca477b08143c7","fd001ca1d2acef5d291806e9b7fe9b7233275cc8","723a2a9acfdc1c6ba66aa54c8dad432081ca4a1f","dc6fc1ee546bd7fafa39519c71d626681444f8cd","4d3ec5e306cc9226f0fa473d0c962a3741c5ae0b","341153ce03c5888f15e47ca47e8808df5d8e096e","bb6411868dfd32a29e1085395176abd233df2009","c5dc2a721288bf6dd21df8fe640fecd2b0daf476","07790389a8782c7e1cef37274bf3c88295bcbd4a","35062e9bc9cda1f66a86d22085ac00cf5a4c779f","db80d026a3327e89b248ce3db36230b7d5ebde86","b70055d60f770397d05fc31d76047cddb25294c6","1d9893a5e93957daad88db9d37587a7c4304590e","bc79d3a66b29638e15576d9b1642ff316b96153d","eb3ea1d29f9b292a50fb55714f329ce677b2eed9","587e9530f79cc30e395886c9d7bbe1bba23e89de","1c2f8dbb68f4c8cf6649a1e6f25d2fcf16ba7555","4c1062abb5d288b106255819c5f75309714e4d43","4db43092cc49215d7bac48cb9a76f7cee7f8069d","4bb9542c2f3028c2906a7c93be8a7e32f0220fb2","507eefabb29458bb0579c3657bcd4b8e0d2e9593","05b2015ff3a61a3a9a0d99d158f8ee2979f5cfed","61de5e8b134817af049e82cb0c7432027c90d761","3ce42fdbff3dacd746588c52e91a00e271690e9d","26467e7d68bdaab07e30ad69e609ccfcc428ab30","d6c7c18d9fed014e436c379b578f2d9c38de684d","309fd20bccd28ef5067e0b4f6d856a9842e49106","e8148c7d7c3a72c27c38e4dbf80a800d010ead8e","97be6ba9ad5cd6555e93d0499f1a1254619114cf","8c94a4cb0fb78d68133b6fad032e5bfff5b90782","2acfb111f0796767b65b0deed1fbab4f3e6983ba","2806559cef2945f0d58a3802f737857df0b34b7f","ecc9b230f5984f98e683018c3ea1c49bba8da2f7","b994c7d7f571447d1f8d83d3396abd44d909c710","09aa75267753afd7bccd223553215887bde8989b","a5abfe114b8f594efd26679340857b8ea5285772","0b3653ec0eee84bf69d915519b4dd5f6f705daf6","51351bcb7f9497f9afa96cf9f3b325ad3bb679b9","b0241b92edca21141f8109f45b029d8c7680594b","41f374b69a2cc3c547c4c2ec53801

Successful procedures are characterized by high predictive accuracy, yielding interpretable models while retaining computational efficiency. Penalized methods that perform coefficient shrinkage have been shown to be successful in many cases. Models with correlated predictors are particularly challenging to tackle. We propose a penalization procedure that performs variable selection while clustering groups of predictors automatically. The oracle properties of this procedure including consistency in group identification are also studied.

The seriation of the skew-symmetric component can emphasize information corresponding to the sign or absolute magnitude of the matrix elements, and the choice of objective criterion can have a profound impact on the ordering. In this research note, we propose a bicriterion approach for seriation of a skew-symmetric matrix incorporating both sign and magnitude information. Two numerical demonstrations reveal that the bicriterion procedure is an effective alternative to direct seriation of the skew-symmetric matrix, facilitating favourable trade-offs among sign and magnitude information.","inCitations":["9375c1141c30e4be02e89249ff596f5b851c75ca","c061a57669269a49f9d1d04b9bb922c33cef7b2c","87197cacda78199810ed62bbccfc15d5eb343089","fdb314ddd6d34bb8b2cf5dd018060e386c57ece7"],"title":"Bicriterion seriation methods for skew-symmetric matrices.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X63908"}

This generic question arises in discussions of many intriguing scientific questions such as What is the probability that an adolescent weighs between 120 and 140 pounds given that they are of average height? and What is the probability of (monetary) inflation exceeding 4% and housing price index below 110? To address such problems, learning some applied, theoretical or cross-disciplinary probability concepts is necessary. Teaching such courses can be improved by utilizing modern information technology resources. Students' understanding of multivariate distributions, conditional probabilities, correlation and causation can be significantly strengthened by employing interactive web-based science educational resources. Independent of the type of a probability course (e.g. majors, minors or service probability course, rigorous measure-theoretic, applied or statistics course) student motivation, learning experiences and knowledge retention may be enhanced by blending modern technological tools within the classical conceptual pedagogical models. We have designed, implemented and disseminated a portable open-source web-application for teaching multivariate distributions, marginal, joint and conditional probabilities using the special case of bivariate Normal distribution. A real adolescent height and weight dataset is used to demonstrate the classroom utilization of the new web-application to address problems of parameter estimation, univariate and multivariate inference.","inCitations":["21ff69e7f256278aed6733d6d2a356fd2e62dfe2","83e6a4c970ad63e78ce6bfaf65450ce36cd7eec8"],"title":"Technology-enhanced Interactive Teaching of Marginal, Joint and Conditional Probabilities: The Special Case of Bivariate Normal Distribution.","doi":"10.1111/test.12012"}

However, existing imputation methods require individual-level genotype data, whereas in practice it is often the case that only summary data are available. For example this may occur because, for reasons of privacy or politics, only summary data are made available to the research community at large; or because only summary data are collected, as in DNA pooling experiments. In this article, we introduce a new statistical method that can accurately infer the frequencies of untyped genetic variants in these settings, and indeed substantially improve frequency estimates at typed variants in pooling experiments where observations are noisy. Our approach, which predicts each allele frequency using a linear combination of observed frequencies, is statistically straight-forward, and related to a long history of the use of linear methods for estimating missing values (e.g. Kriging). The main statistical novelty is our approach to regularizing the covariance matrix estimates, and the resulting linear predictors, which is based on methods from population genetics. We find that, besides being both fast and flexible - allowing new problems to be tackled that cannot be handled by existing imputation approaches purpose-built for the genetic context - these linear methods are also very accurate. Indeed, imputation accuracy using this approach is similar to that obtained by state-of-the art imputation methods that use individual-level data, but at a fraction of the computational cost.","inCitations":["4455187cb2453beb5c87aad69b34849051d34f0b","65c713519de55fa98e46fad35f29b716b9e1d710","7c392d2bb94834b282361d009ce02e6f5e202767","48cff9bac37533e6f850ea6ae4bdb1da5b78a61f","006e91a9c37de2821800373949b1eb0859b3faab","414fb04fb8f4012e301bc71d6e0aeded10f68c31","3904a854d3e9a37dc6c02bfbdd9acfa0bc489501","2570364b5f2d725c21491728d1e829c9100cf9b5","08941eb9054eedb0732daac8113ca19255071a36","c54f3dc6eb10f2620426bbbee9219cd4d9a7eff5","44b9f604fd212d6b875e195ea17bd18c1439aba4","61362fefd074e75a3b8863abdd2c1c41daece225","91f634e43c3d9a80e3bd34a2799c3b14dc13858b","edf71d6081e0224b93d4fafdaf24b3025e75a0fb","07324e07c1bffe54cdcfaf6bd4e487a1858a7757","e84e5d932ca3286d2624f9ec8f0bcec481ad11a8","c9ead6cda633603dc2e7ff3979e6774754711b7d","8a4151818d0b44ef7b9a60e369fec819993bd541","59f3357605348b8c97256257aadae07861035aca","0d41d495210e403bba5bd33bd52fdf8429592c0a","fdf5578b445cb5cbd29e798687616ad5e5d4ca2d","d3ec33be99af74612a53bd36cae273125f8fa727","6abec75e4b8d991e5397717a95c354dafd1abb03","afbb4916bd1de07f6c1baa614b1d3c57451cadfd","70af1500a0d7baf8de993873d879bdadbbec97fd","d64fb792886b9dff80b7792011daac61b4998ffd","2272c7d3980738b54626aa52f0a58fbd26f41125","4a10f9f11d4e43ce34328f08b81c3d703c12a50e","cf0267443ba80b2a0b277078904787c605c6f7dc","d499c8f5f947fdf097e4ba7364b9a3ab8060d823","a63b777e1910c3909883877ec443b7a1f123aa9e","f6785d8d6908f0a9b7aa3607a2d46a09400c793d","5cf49df88b4efcdbfe5f1bf2b72ec7f7e6d95b08","a40f530336c163f1885ed5107c740b2212b7c6cd","3a5a32ae3f67dc45dfbf6988d2687de75ef24b92","14469fd05ca3f6ac58e650a9c3945c2d983677a4","ec21617e1bc862279aa6f308b7d4d035f8dfb67e","7102d82f1b486394f8be34ad1bc2793e26119bde","5d7b3241192a7462d2493d0ece22e7c5772afe2b","b882237863681826282bd036e91da6c90685d58d","d7bb716cd2be3cfaca8ff4e8f4ea0f5ae89ff665","57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd","6b5a006e964a70cf18477a9f42695c75e0ec927f","daf9f63cfa6a57cb86e1a7807bec419b217a06af","a18f6ada158feb87eb93e759a54f3ba96d6fec6a","c9659958d76ac8602f393e435c8441b8722f9b1f","b6b770ce1fbb9cd19a6cc63e90e2f853d8eb8553","53e482709dcf7f3c6ef303045230cf50a235842d","5983328730b803bda61c27360c321cd8124285ee","bd4acb3fd591bfcf412bf21bf52d1964281a1271","e94cd9e752fa9123a9aefca8a545d07d21b8d818","30c44057f4e1ed110d9d16c3d925496fde7758d0"],"title":"Using Linear Predictors to Impute Allele Frequencies from Summary or Pooled Genotype Data.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS338"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"BACKGROUND\nNormalization and data quality control are two important aspects in microarray data analysis. Proper normalization and data quality control ensure that intensity ratios provide meaningful and accurate measurement of relative gene expression values. Control spots such as spikes and housekeeping genes with known concentrations in two channels are often used for calibrating experimental parameters. They provide valuable information about experimental variation which can be utilized for better normalization. They are also needed for proper normalization in cases that the most of the spots tend to change in one direction. In addition, it is desirable to include information on spot quality. Such information is available in a typical microarray data set, but is not fully utilized by existing normalization methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe propose two extensions of the two-way semi-linear model (TW-SLM) for appropriately combining control genes and spot quality information in normalization. The first extension (TW-SLMC) is designed to systematically incorporate control spots in a semi-parametric model to calibrate estimated normalization curves so that the relative fold changes of gene expressions are accurately estimated. Extrapolation is not required in this approach. The second extension (TW-SLMQ) is proposed to incorporate spot quality measure into normalization. This approach down-weights spots with lower quality scores in normalization. These two extensions can be used simultaneously for normalizing a data set. Two microarray data sets are used to demonstrate the proposed methods.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nAn R based computing package is developed for the proposed methods and available from the corresponding authors.","inCitations":["8e75b1aa559b9798c42cbbb7285233d6da8fc1a3","7820351dc6adc890372bb892e46f86854cde2f59","11633e5e99664c7758a99b532075d7bf99a965a7"],"title":"Systematic approaches for incorporating control spots and data quality information to improve normalization of cDNA microarray data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701199544"}

In the case of a z-test, the width of the confidence interval is a function of statistical power for the planned study. If minimum effect size is used in power analysis, the width of the confidence interval is the minimum effect size times a multiplicative factor φ. The index φ, or the precision-to-effect ratio, is a function of the computed statistical power. In the case of a t-test, statistical power affects the probability of achieving a certain width of confidence interval, which is equivalent to the probability of obtaining a certain value of φ. To consider estimate precision in conjunction with statistical power, we can choose a sample size to obtain a desired probability of achieving a short width conditional on the rejection of the null hypothesis.","inCitations":["92d006fb234f8dce9e32eb47a928435ceda2644d","c09612f9087926899394b5bcdd805242dc9ffe9e","710470906001aff06d5fba27963a7b744b21fb82","f01b657f8ecbf24e7f08bbaf0eb806bc8a05747c","49cc0a3b67a963116f14b188e91859948bc0242f","7a82956444cbaa02d5eec84f60648f544ff46cd7"],"title":"Implications of statistical power for confidence intervals.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02035.x"}

Using the MESE model with 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, I find prior mathematics proficiency and personality have been previously underestimated in the STEM retention literature. Pre-college mathematics proficiency and personality explain large portions of the racial and gender gaps. The findings have implications for those who design interventions aimed at increasing the rates of STEM persistence among women and under-represented minorities.","inCitations":["b512f4624a6f0979773ecd07d85375647e792071","3bc71c098c4f300403d5b9c4fa582cc1e5a21774","b00e838dcaae92718c764aa56623ba817fb2d62b","c5df54ae2bd2a41fc92db71e4ea4445552e02a63","11eb4374ff3875a64590c78b940739081b7521b9"],"title":"Correcting for Measurement Error in Latent Variables Used as Predictors.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS877"}

However, it may also be desirable to make comparisons among only those acts in which the participants correctly followed all condom use instructions before, during, and after the act of intercourse (i.e., the \"correct-use\" subset). The timing associated with the definition of correct use creates a dilemma in that an act cannot be classified as a \"correct-use act\" until after the completion of both intercourse and withdrawal; if a condom fails (e.g., breaks or slips completely off of the penis) during intercourse then the couple has no chance at correct use during withdrawal. As a result of the implicitly conditional nature of this problem, it is not a simple matter to specify a correct-use subset of the primary analysis sample. With this in mind, we develop estimators for the correct-use failure probabilities, the corresponding standard errors, and test statistics for comparing the correct-use failure probabilities between condom groups. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods by applying them to data from a clinical study of condom contraceptive effectiveness, and we use simulated data to investigate the finite sample properties of the proposed methods. The simulation results indicate that one of our proposed estimators is at least approximately unbiased, even in small samples. Furthermore, one-sided noninferiority tests performed using this estimator tend to have sizes that are only marginally larger than the nominal test size in moderate to large samples.","inCitations":["417b340b814ba33608480d8f533e331528dbfe89"],"title":"Estimating and comparing correct-use failure probabilities in clinical studies of condom functionality.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120022774"}

This methodology extends previous work by the assumption of unknown variance.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a semi-supervised clustering method using the tumor genomic DNA copy number alterations to classify each patient into inferred clinical outcome groups of metastatic potential. Our data set was comprised of 294 primary tumors and 49 metastases from 5 independent cohorts of prostate cancer patients. The alterations were modeled based on Darwin's evolutionary selection theory and the genes overlapping these altered genomic regions were used to develop a metastatic potential score for a prostate cancer primary tumor. The function of the proteins encoded by some of the predictor genes promote escape from anoikis, a pathway of apoptosis, deregulated in metastases. We evaluated the metastatic potential score with other clinical predictors available at diagnosis using a Cox proportional hazards model and show our proposed score was the only significant predictor of metastasis free survival. The metastasis gene signature and associated score could be applied directly to copy number alteration profiles from patient biopsies positive for prostate cancer.","inCitations":["9a752665ea89386b80739db8704aed429c9d32f9","dada1338b8cce5fcef670225ebb4d33201b3003b"],"title":"Clustering-Based Method for Developing a Genomic Copy Number Alteration Signature for Predicting the Metastatic Potential of Prostate Cancer.","doi":"10.1155/2012/873570"}

Traditional statistical testing approaches, such as the two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon test, are frequently used for evaluating statistical significance of informative expressions but require adjustment for large-scale multiplicity. Due to its simplicity, Bonferroni adjustment has been widely used to circumvent this problem. It is well known, however, that the standard Bonferroni test is often very conservative. In the present paper, we compare three multiple testing procedures in the microarray context: the original Bonferroni method, a Bonferroni-type improved single-step method and a step-down method. The latter two methods are based on nonparametric resampling, by which the null distribution can be derived with the dependency structure among gene expressions preserved and the family-wise error rate accurately controlled at the desired level. We also present a sample size calculation method for designing microarray studies. Through simulations and data analyses, we find that the proposed methods for testing and sample size calculation are computationally fast and control error and power precisely.","inCitations":["195ead0c3829f941f659241aeaa111bcb1579f5b","06b916219dc2248d5d2b4e6bd9bebcea24e656d3","b646e7164fb2e01dd288fedc48bd5511ad656b57","f62dd2ddf07463a366da176bf7294923140b7b5b","4dfeeae03277b06c30f66a62ba27116f47535bda","34dd21fd86c337642de88334b7e696d94f057833","81bdd7b0f250f5fcebea07b2aa65cc597de2be62","b3e7cbb603d112249bfef710e4012012f9b55a6a","51c77c289835aa2c5b90e30b4968ccfa33391bf7","a7c6cd82cd51ee067c740d6d872eddf6bd7c763c","604ee9ce5a7daa35020171b80b23f82eb7b3378a","ca9c3024a19c861aa5ccbe67ce81b1969369781b","c2835189f9d323844e13facad91be26b0bdb584f","64871565c783ce180007170fef17dbda5d9a1a69","ef8b59845865c7d03414667a53adcccc15666a78","a60895c9b28b104321e6c581d9e503203871879b","c2db3167ab802d1258f3f554eb5de22a8b416b82","b2d144d38b9eabe3bcd27b86724fa830a70c377e","47eb8ee48720e23c403be9c0d94eaad3f9deaf46","b61afdd0df28eda2090c320c10b69b666e3f4e5e","1c796e57afdadaadf935b0031c327a4158fca3d9","83a7f9e2089941f810c896228cee7623562b2f9f","332c899bdef4076455c4bdae5c66703035fd35c0","3f2d21ff9c3ccf6b0e7f4154ab1f9b81bdb7f62c","566fae807e2f32a38e7fcb584382b1fc81d05830","39b7369d7d5067a238f5736820afb99c05e98cd7","c13f22ab6d9aec9e747194db2457024fa5594410","c94a0297f97d301d64ca2b20a4ad5d0146907e96","fd464253701df13d3fcc2b7318323740605aac44","cd2a4319087914e4a7187d89873f6162c7e72fde","88b7ceb335a3e88333a86d60e41454da21e2875e","1cade48f4677e6863148988a6fc96ed34c8e91a8","ef97282ac0a2ca98bc4f4c9a8d98f7d561e2bfa9","856197137b3df3cb2d04f53e284aeadebf4e0d12","32b5f8eaf9aa7d3d82b2d1ab75a6fd9f94f099fb","de927b5a56d9a63c6bb75042fe78afa6c59dd687","6d0cf0c1baf6e295ab3c423fd86b682f0ca331ea","2e20764a2ba5f34f2d926bd8ec9cdd1b497fe042","04011d7b612865a99fadb4f90330d2bbf5455c18","56d17f14f1eb41c7be3c5e1a964c3a6ef4a31c63","3840568ea7c493e5448b2506455e092d986a853f","a258531992f17e5de933149178b40c6b8e7454f2","2185aebf5311b6982c88b6322fb3f04bf8d864c3","60d7264b52989e68b1f0b4d8ab762b85ed180466","2352260cf0eb99321b34c57be2424679cf957d87"],"title":"Sample size calculation for multiple testing in microarray data analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxh026"}

We show that the power achieved by different statistical approaches is greatly influenced by (i) the 'structure' of the variance-covariance matrix of the vector of within-subject responses and (ii) how the baseline (i.e., pre-treatment) responses are accounted for in the analysis. For (ii), we compare different approaches including ignoring one or both period baselines, using a common change from baseline analysis (which we advise against), using functions of one or both baselines as period-specific or period-invariant covariates, and doing joint modeling of the post-baseline and baseline responses with corresponding mean constraints for the latter. Based on theoretical arguments and simulation-based type I error rate and power properties, we recommend an analysis of covariance approach that uses the within-subject difference in treatment responses as the dependent variable and the corresponding difference in baseline responses as a covariate.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The power of a clinical trial is partly dependent upon its sample size. With continuous data, the sample size needed to attain a desired power is a function of the within-group standard deviation. An estimate of this standard deviation can be obtained during the trial itself based upon interim data; the estimate is then used to re-estimate the sample size. Gould and Shih proposed a method, based on the EM algorithm, which they claim produces a maximum likelihood estimate of the within-group standard deviation while preserving the blind, and that the estimate is quite satisfactory. However, others have claimed that the method can produce non-unique and/or severe underestimates of the true within-group standard deviation. Here the method is thoroughly examined to resolve the conflicting claims and, via simulation, to assess its validity and the properties of its estimates. The results show that the apparent non-uniqueness of the method's estimate is due to an apparently innocuous alteration that Gould and Shih made to the EM algorithm. When this alteration is removed, the method is valid in that it produces the maximum likelihood estimate of the within-group standard deviation (and also of the within-group means). However, the estimate is negatively biased and has a large standard deviation. The simulations show that with a standardized difference of 1 or less, which is typical in most clinical trials, the standard deviation from the combined samples ignoring the groups is a better estimator, despite its obvious positive bias.","inCitations":["088680d68f1c1cb7f67b56b00b9b6cbe42e99a92","7f1a4f637b151dfffd72045ea05d60f699fe0672","b9b7663521541e316f0c15fd23e1029c3d4359bb","20847f31b8a521877958b35271a86aa786e8b4c5","ecc0801e4efa796cd2dbeb014c225f666f568c55","0424772fd6a3f02513453cacdbb7b25f6bd866b2","62a00d6834407c67e3f79558d061b852b27c30fe","2f3f2b45b460729de966bc881dba42dc2ced15b3","b845b3f4a0c6c8f03920781169c9db663f63ac65","863c0e499d88d323ae4727944687cb1a10ec28fa","bc7e5dae40578abb76958c7d413ab4d954eefea0"],"title":"Assessment of the Gould-Shih procedure for sample size re-estimation.","doi":"10.1002/pst.244"}

Demonstration of consistency of manufacturing can be viewed as a multigroup equivalence problem. The standard statistical procedures for evaluating equivalence assume normally distributed data and define equivalence margins with respect to group means. As an alternative approach, we define a measure of the similarity among group distributions and their nonparametric estimators. Through computer simulations we explore the statistical properties of an equivalence test based on this estimator and compare them to the standard methods. Preliminary work suggests that a test of similarity can be useful in demonstrating equivalence when distributions are not normal or when there are differences in scale or shape. It appears to detect departures from equivalence that are not reflected by differences among group means.","inCitations":["39332110b9c123f63af1aa7d0b2538afcfc8d860","7d1b7a3655d0c609a7878f844ee988832ff5c96c","f3bd0949121b635446339f90eda1449c971faadc"],"title":"Lot consistency as an equivalence problem.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120037179"}

These residuals do not share the same second moments when the null hypothesis is false, which makes them difficult to use in the setting of multiple testing. An alternative approach is to resample standardized residuals, data centered by group sample means and standardized by group sample covariance matrices. This approach, however, has been observed to inflate type I error when sample size is small or data are generated from heavy-tailed distributions. We propose to improve this approach by using robust estimation for the first and second moments. We discuss two statistics: the Bartlett statistic and a statistic based on eigen-decomposition of sample covariance matrices. Both statistics can be expressed in terms of standardized errors under the null hypothesis. These methods are extended to test homogeneity in correlation matrices. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that the robust resampling approach provides comparable or superior performance, relative to traditional approaches, for single testing and reasonable performance for multiple testing. The proposed methods are applied to data collected in an HIV vaccine trial to investigate possible determinants, including vaccine status, vaccine-induced immune response level and viral genotype, of unusual correlation pattern between HIV viral load and CD4 count in newly infected patients.","inCitations":["9b468e686de93175e2e88888a19aa8623c3e92df"],"title":"Resampling-based Methods in Single and Multiple Testing for Equality of Covariance/Correlation Matrices","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1388"}

The EB approach is a blend of the conventional univariate and multivariate approaches. Specifically, in the EB approach, the underlying covariance matrix is estimated by a weighted sum of the univariate and multivariate estimators. In addition to demonstrating that his approach controls test size and frequently is more powerful than either the epsilon-adjusted univariate or multivariate approaches, Boik showed how conventional multivariate software can be used to conduct EB analyses. Our investigation examined the Type I error properties of the EB approach when its derivational assumptions were not satisfied as well as when other factors known to affect the conventional tests of significance were varied. For comparative purposes we also investigated procedures presented by Huynh and by Keselman, Carriere, and Lix, procedures designed for non-spherical data and covariance heterogeneity, as well as an adjusted univariate and multivariate test statistic. Our results indicate that when the response variable is normally distributed and group sizes are equal, the EB approach was robust to violations of its derivational assumptions and therefore is recommended due to the power findings reported by Boik. However, we also found that both the EB approach and the adjusted univariate and multivariate procedures were prone to depressed or elevated rates of Type I error when data were non-normally distributed and covariance matrices and group sizes were either positively or negatively paired with one another. On the other hand, the Huynh and Keselman et al. procedures were generally robust to these same pairings of covariance matrices and group sizes.","inCitations":["750684db9d1bef12147b24020b1a8532600c4cf6","87a28f1ce59ee32d46f30e4f7b4d3f78849c4b0a","a6ae5ea1b72a61b9d6a3143917deef50f67854c6","1713f3243525f8fe36bb9e2de97ba1b098849151","fce12df302697e94f22d3d5570dd655676534484","4aacaa937022b81dbacae9a85053422553ee85a9","d59b8014cae5953a29ad1e2c75e016ba2b9ae1db"],"title":"An examination of the robustness of the empirical Bayes and other approaches for testing main and interaction effects in repeated measures designs.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159178"}

Since regulatory agencies usually require the model-independent estimation of PK measures, we focus on the empirical approach while using the model-based approach and corresponding measures as a benchmark. We show how to \"split\" a single sampling grid into two or more subsets, which substantially reduces the number of samples taken for each patient, but often has little effect on the precision of estimation of PK measures in terms of mean squared error (MSE).

The deficiency of using just one method of analysis is that it depends on assumptions that may not be met. For robust inference, we propose pre-specifying multiple test statistics and relying on the minimum p-value for testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect. The null hypothesis associated with the various test statistics is that the treatment groups are indistinguishable. The critical value for hypothesis testing comes from permutation distributions. Rejection of the null hypothesis when the smallest p-value is less than the critical value controls the type I error rate at its designated value. Even if one of the candidate test statistics has low power, the adverse effect on the power of the minimum p-value statistic is not much. Its use is illustrated with examples. We conclude that it is better to rely on the minimum p-value rather than a single statistic particularly when that single statistic is the logrank test, because of the cost and complexity of many survival trials.","inCitations":["d0d6f17ef7fec826966266f234b8a87170c4cb46","e625b62266db32015cc36edbc48b6760348c5eee","b7f978969763ef4bf920b3783bae29cfffca1aab"],"title":"Robust inference from multiple test statistics via permutations: a better alternative to the single test statistic approach for randomized trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1582"}

In order to define our statistical target we partition the sample in V equal size sub-samples, and use this partitioning to define V splits in an estimation sample (one of the V subsamples) and corresponding complementary parameter-generating sample. For each of the V parameter-generating samples, we apply an algorithm that maps the sample to a statistical target parameter. We define our sample-split data adaptive statistical target parameter as the average of these V-sample specific target parameters. We present an estimator (and corresponding central limit theorem) of this type of data adaptive target parameter. This general methodology for generating data adaptive target parameters is demonstrated with a number of practical examples that highlight new opportunities for statistical learning from data. This new framework provides a rigorous statistical methodology for both exploratory and confirmatory analysis within the same data. Given that more research is becoming “data-driven”, the theory developed within this paper provides a new impetus for a greater involvement of statistical inference into problems that are being increasingly addressed by clever, yet ad hoc pattern finding methods. To suggest such potential, and to verify the predictions of the theory, extensive simulation studies, along with a data analysis based on adaptively determined intervention rules are shown and give insight into how to structure such an approach. The results show that the data adaptive target parameter approach provides a general framework and resulting methodology for data-driven science.","inCitations":["2c7cc63e1263ab5deef9f227a254049e537b05f8","e0b46984b9e267f5735340bf8e3c508b2264894f","9bc57e3d8847ba6f23def295dfecf9da80fafa3d","c7a2bc5dc9ec485c473f062ad5cd606f457ee820","75f09fefce77947dd72916a634c6dca6174d4233","cd7a58c15dadf6d55ed3af238e49b978a4b37106","f75b70c9d7078724b592ec3e21de705e7b6ff73f","1f74d49850c73b3280bd175104afb234790ca72d","afd9cc8b618d998e92e9d5bb2b18db2aa9050ffa","c37d30f7162e7fec10a9bc3fd36277151c177c71","db0c1b316aa03b1bcc0be9698dae97243b685a5e","d17be597228d45799dae46531faee5eec97b80ef","aee0c1bc5e1914544571ddaa4563a8fc3985256d","dd5b248655369983346f565b48ef8cc64702ec45","97d7af123c08cfa108689ddb3957cf5987297172","a5a341eebc045665dd5eb7abaa5c5cc34992404d","bd99f11f2df3dcb3526aca6de8d6d2a264bf6b49","25ec378cebbc9d608d38ec891999b37791fdd689","a0408230aff1b4c178e07504ba24aa31718e99ad","df4ae091df277864af88e9d44c9b3a547f7758df","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c","e568a265747151e23e6db7ae64437dd854385fcb","e22ff66105359b033de05f2468cd989906682773"],"title":"Statistical Inference for Data Adaptive Target Parameters","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0013"}

In more recent years, the discussion has focused on finding subsets of genomes which play a role in the effect of treatment, often referred to as stratified or personalized medicine. Though highly sought after, methods for detecting subsets with altering treatment effects are limited and lacking in power. In this article we discuss variable selection for qualitative interactions with the aim to discover these critical patient subsets. We propose a new technique designed specifically to find these interaction variables among a large set of variables while still controlling for the number of false discoveries. We compare this new method against standard qualitative interaction tests using simulations and give an example of its use on data from a randomized controlled trial for the treatment of depression.","inCitations":["ae74dc8efe773c1a1d1805824a3468151eaadccf","f19257ac730be56a293af5dfa742a40be4c97482","f81d704b0449f1546fa1b067cb8065cef77f8488","af4f022fbb032ff4b4b8a33a83d0a2fb39566c7f","fbfdc024cde5db43730bd916e8ebbfc1255e841a","5cdd187dfdcaef62c847256af7807495805bca05","f4290d39798b5b6e71ddd85a7af379bb6170c510","2822cd4f41962615b1ae6e1a8480a3c4afe1b33f","71dcb641dc68cb5b8ea44e349110385cbf2b24b2","2b720460f237b9b7d226ee3b7c33d948b69cdeca","b0af88e247d4b4f6eb87e4bfe66684dbd4ca3e90"],"title":"Variable selection for qualitative interactions in personalized medicine while controlling the family-wise error rate.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.608052"}
