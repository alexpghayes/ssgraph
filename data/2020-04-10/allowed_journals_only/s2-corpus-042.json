Typically, clinical samples are limited and/or the sampling cost is high. Thus, it is essential to determine an adequate sample size needed to build a classifier based on SNPs. Such a classifier would facilitate correct classifications, while keeping the sample size to a minimum, thereby making the studies cost-effective. For coded SNP data from 2 classes, an optimal classifier and an approximation to its probability of correct classification (PCC) are derived. A linear classifier is constructed and an approximation to its PCC is also derived. These approximations are validated through a variety of Monte Carlo simulations. A sample size determination algorithm based on the criterion, which ensures that the difference between the 2 approximate PCCs is below a threshold, is given and its effectiveness is illustrated via simulations. For the HapMap data on Chinese and Japanese populations, a linear classifier is built using 51 independent SNPs, and the required total sample sizes are determined using our algorithm, as the threshold varies. For example, when the threshold value is 0.05, our algorithm determines a total sample size of 166 (83 for Chinese and 83 for Japanese) that satisfies the criterion.","inCitations":["f2fa75eca029d658706b5920ea4f03be3fb61540","6ca93530df2a83dcb1963459266eefb54429ff9f","7d934d277abfe507631f9d181effa40ffad3fd38","e476b89ad6acc97b06307549a58b9b81034b4c2b"],"title":"Sample size determination for classifiers based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr053"}

Incomparable arrays (one type of ineligible arrays) arise as the experimental factors are poorly controlled. Due to the high volume of data in gene arrays, examination of array comparability requires special treatments to reduce data dimension without distortion. This paper proposes a graphical approach to address these issues. The proposed approach uses percentile methods to group data, and applies the 2D image plot to display the grouped data. Moreover, an invariant band is employed to quantify degrees of array comparability. We use two publicly available oligonucleotide array datasets from Affymetrix GeneChip System for evaluation. The results demonstrate the utility of our approach to examine data quality and also as an exploratory tool to verify differentially expressed genes selected by vigorous statistical methods.","inCitations":["5f6418a76dd99232ffdee2ed2e2e02bbaa637a61","2aeb1014dc66515c533369394b9d23212ffdbc0c","7aeace2306487c5e5f3ff6711e1a5d3fc1e4c899","9dd1564d42a3e6024651cf2bca63d503ea61a7b5","04f8b71b974a3cc40decfbc00c1640de16d1fd41","46dd1c78a47d25618225e7f7c35aedba1bee535b","957ca626e4292f288cb3cdaadf2baf18dc2a212a","0083258d79b0e5dfada443dfb204df8289fe0244","8e6826b58cd217ecc5d6227ea3b29fa70ca7667f","e6529e672b1d87dbd24a69e60bcaf9df6ddba0b3"],"title":"A graphical approach for quality control of oligonucleotide array data.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200025651"}

I describe the representation in detail and introduce the spectralGP package in R for computations. Because of the large number of basis coefficients, some form of shrinkage is necessary; I focus on a natural Bayesian approach via a particular parameterized prior structure that approximates stationary Gaussian processes on a regular grid. I review several models from the literature for data that do not lie on a grid, suggest a simple model modification, and provide example code demonstrating MCMC sampling using the spectralGP package. I describe reasons that mixing can be slow in certain situations and provide some suggestions for MCMC techniques to improve mixing, also with example code, and some general recommendations grounded in experience.","inCitations":["e12b9ea21e4d0f77afd577608e1e2e67bfc365e4","4e55ec0b20937c9b69b6357ff0ef9fbe928ee6d3","7700190ed77117da00063e642c84ae05ae715a3a","5fe7454471f99c71c717b825cc5488a9bb7f6f06","c4a404eb202be07d3f5ca7ef544686ee2d831f35","a9fae3cbd13c2d0a80a1f0a625167884d2738344","1181156dff6dd5c4cc5713cf5cb7c88ea4cf8787","ed9c886897dd8b37c01bba4c81823d70369df95c","11a888ba3c2f3bdb09e020835d37ee758f081b33","449047909eba15e152337c87b8f26ec198f7a446","5a0ecc049f8ed9f2ab68754ee35d012c0f5c4a83","555b9b821482cfc752c792dfe67f899a3bf6c58b","2112895f5330997cff0689e490df63d8617aa7cd","f9906d9f89824022dd9d7db6d3ceff30d829e750","20d8e3a35efdf5918f972f42e9938383c87c190f","453af3b48dbb35456903e6098753598be0363753","7b0b4f03c2a953dc8f364d2384f4a109d3f7dd91","9b74ec7ee823f71d39f7abd6ea5d08cce67269c4","81a1722919dbef26b4661595486d30f659768cd7","d3692d67047f4888c2774875c4240257be9cc3be","9b37baf6b02cbdc65931ad0614a64f4407babe7f","7e3c4be7b82d54ffba5327547f47bef1a066537d","27d0e609ff8b4e3ddf00445526be3580bf7a7ae1","ffc307be44bb853be5ce6d699405e333cfee6856","7a92e48d4ab63d982b6e5c70538bfd8a0d50c30e","b45cabf0cdc4861bbb6d09affe8c5900011a9615","4e2b3450d9579f3bc700403a4a0d89a56b361bc1","bd79edc8323c3432138af5cafe92f312dc220b36","966be76d5c495110120671efe390b22b42179b82","b91351729ca210e4ad1a2153b0f11fea6bedfdea","b951b22d7c955beef9ac49f71c1abc1ffa6089c0","d9c8ee90846d02ae61c1833ed8e2ef08318b1bea","4f8cb153c7a55d747a6be53ce50e9e22f95708b3"],"title":"Bayesian Smoothing with Gaussian Processes Using Fourier Basis Functions in the spectralGP Package.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v019.i02"}

We consider an extract of functional disability data from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and attempt to develop disability profiles using variations of the Grade of Membership (GoM) model. We first describe GoM as an individual-level mixture model that allows individuals to have partial membership in several mixture components simultaneously. We then prove the equivalence between individual-level and population-level mixture models, and use this property to develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian estimation of the model. We use our approach to analyze functional disability data from the NLTCS.","inCitations":["0c93a9a723be28805c26de71d2ca19d41832b635","d53f71ed9537f2f125358cda26fb0341e2e5204f","54515b7850e32901598839f5225d8d2f787863bd","ba7fee5e6ecad786d58b738c840a71aea9335119","ab406fa804a206766b1118d0f774def28f2c80e7","9f6c0954bd4fa5c8e81924e503d3a652249a3c20","89cd3061b60d1bddf891c6b0f9da94477d7e84a0","d1f8262ddd1b2c70be793dee8db7a9eb1e5335c1","10daa574f0750ff12b60d5b8deee375723deeb81","15397bbfbf84385a55d7f116cb9fbb68472cd66c","4d9486a64996216745458b0f412c93879f66e5df","972fad13bacb760bf9f913ef175b6196e0360421","c5b17904460479290498c3da7f4a3ee9390f1d52","b599b0e90e203704040003f4a5736cb61c4d0db1","8a8964e50c1f00cd904c3b350dc69d485b9b334a","b737b228865eefb4a5627d77a0c0984c64fb98ed","579be00ef7244388b695cdcb7d315c10c769c17e","a1d23c86bc03ef852c862c18eeeeb4adfa690911","15a06f418c9eaf8d552d7ae4f975f7b25667efbf","f8a1551347bcd8aeabf6d81d3815cb0d6aae1039","5a15974eac77c9349968cc71ddb62e5fde772974","3266b3317f848d3c545bd9ab6c1621e356202f84","ee19f4365e3e1e47920d21d03dd68954ae3281a3","cb289c15e591025b92480ae31419443da324f4c5","286a7efd62e7ea4d6353ac3dff05664bbdce5717","a0186ee12e95b0ca773ac6ec493c0beeecce0263","e5810a318766a6cb56eeb2bf5f58a7453fb4e701","3bca4994e5445b7176878d6041fd48f9cfcda49c","e906552d403c1a7853d4f7c2ccc5f5019bf8210c","d24d795d7e436ab2f8b1bd4fbc7fb32947c531b6","12bf199bca3c4aab79d9e7d823aa5c446df51d10","595e82c03693d58f966d38adf75f5b8f03b11096","3286b4e5007aa6414afbba96319e916822d8d1d0","f0f1292719f02a59990a7fd4a35b97de85be1c11","0c301ca02424c401c25a0ec4bcff68088469ca0f","b8d889229ff64fde573dba9a45a746ae2329b07c","483c7b0934c16fa0aa5505a421220209b6c6db41","25badc676197a70aaf9911865eb03469e402ba57","f465a1b03d8dfa809ec033449d30f79c24621459","df66736ff7e27e5efa828db7478b4bc1203d7903","894b9265b1bf282859fed21f86b509f176bf5fd2","2737cc9e946555a61f253ac2931d04bc43bc82aa","efdbb2c7972a618296ac68dc28ab842f4bfdbae8","a328faf454bec0ad841aed0084ce8ce475b75d46","a44b1323b025d71ad2fdaf4d5ea6a99fa35e9d10","28ba1f0107aa60b9c8ecbc2f6ee55bd36f6ae0ac","1c5477dd85b545d3e5dfa535eb4c71595a9130ec","846752bb89df6f084e2547a5aa5d58cb77f7d690","13f265c436bc35460c2635f8c2da6f9afadc698b","e981f16fde9185373634b53d94baa1f9185ff890","deda6f8719d751402307512dcf1fb2e4014010b5","c08e9307cc387bed298335f32a983a2eebf81b85","596fdb90d71a7119ff34edcbbd9ce6fa54f2052d","a7eca1b453566c9f8cc27291e2cd4371c9290bc9","3fd7900cc4f47931b99e23c8d7ecd4754add557a","4ea5666ade90be90370dcc78e0188fb6d6a0ad9f","660c917c0da9f076ca5ebac6e058cccb7abdc3b3","1c8e221fe3a687deda41289e1728427e52aba97b","593cb435702d2e6e7ed8c84dec1c3154bcc11df9","cae5bef4b78301c2e483d9ff61348f2cae4fc651","c3c3e2e0f6e54b4da70ceeb81cc5c274731c88b6","a55706a5600515ce61a94114234898cd519660f4","56548cf42c8acca96b4f31786abc6e6a56d9b53c","5e6b9f65729bb2373a7661b5af5da0179f64140c","64bf28c99175f41da306ba24c99131f2f3c60db0","6f24d7a6e1c88828e18d16c6db20f5329f6a6827","17a74e3a13a02b33395a8933a025d8b517ed4bd7","07a115e752fdd2a7465cf4dde9f38c3c8733467e","81d253aa3c756490e10322ed3bac00df57f741a6","70ecd9947b3e4428f099d5c45e1afdf70639e061","17cee81e82cde25d64c9a748f050f9327b3fa7de","19de6b41be976f7035fa8927932a0a89bf359a42","9e31f877b897f03dcfed5cf04cc01ea48b1d7518","32c0708c8ae5323de88a7d83cfb0e866f226a7a9"],"title":"Describing Disability through Individual-level Mixture Models for Multivariate Binary Data.","doi":"10.1214/07-AOAS126"}

A common example is that of making decisions, such as comparing treatments or selecting a best dose, based on both the probability of efficacy and the probability toxicity. In most applications, the 2-dimensional parameter is defined in terms of a model parameter of higher dimension including effects of treatment and possibly covariates. Each method uses a geometric construct in the 2-dimensional parameter space based on a set of elicited parameter pairs as a basis for defining decision rules. The first construct is a family of contours that partitions the parameter space, with the contours constructed so that all parameter pairs on a given contour are equally desirable. The partition is used to define statistical decision rules that discriminate between parameter pairs in term of their desirabilities. The second construct is a convex 2-dimensional set of desirable parameter pairs, with decisions based on posterior probabilities of this set for given combinations of treatments and covariates under a Bayesian formulation. A general framework for all of these methods is provided, and each method is illustrated by one or more applications.","inCitations":["deb0941e1832025692e071a1077cde1315bf693f","dd483a32dfc45b7b0537e694aad2bfba71ddfa7d","08225bd9fad0855bcad1eec69bf3e2b1903cb379","5624295eebbaa7741a84a68a5056b2e7121f3829","f5b4a290805cf621c1d61d5e3a1481ec215aaf4e","706de60030ee5d38da2cf99b98269ed50721896f"],"title":"Some Geometric Methods for Constructing Decision Criteria Based On Two-Dimensional Parameters.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2007.06.013"}

We present an extension of the mixture of factor analyzers model (MFA) allowing for simultaneous clustering of genes and conditions. The proposed model is rather flexible since it models the density of high-dimensional data assuming a mixture of Gaussian distributions with a particular omponent-specific covariance structure. Specifically, a binary and row stochastic matrix representing tissue membership is used to cluster tissues (experimental conditions), whereas the traditional mixture approach is used to define the gene clustering. An alternating expectation conditional maximization (AECM) algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation; experiments on simulated and real data show the efficiency of our method as a general approach to biclustering. The Matlab code of the algorithm is available upon request from authors.","inCitations":["9e1ca6420b8c39eba7c564a5a7fe119a016cb865","ed28f27133e0450c9fbe55b5cab07c4d0a7092c2","3dda029ab40c349ef111a408b865c82cf93e8789","259d9b93fe51df19586c6655b6f48a0a94653b44","0249e41264e04833e4717518ad267127bd4878f5","68ee38b9b34167b7491375e39eaa47042a634789","da68a506552a71586f4692d63c2cb1dbba88e1e2","ad4475e0447e48adf04d1a44bc6ddb384bedd08f","48c001f80e44453a61939ff78fb6b5b41632db1e"],"title":"Biclustering of Gene Expression Data by an Extension of Mixtures of Factor Analyzers","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1078"}

Prior literature has proposed methods to address the problem of censoring due to assay limit of detection, but not random censoring. We propose imputation methods and a survival regression method that do not require parametric assumptions about the distribution of the censored covariate. Existing imputation methods address missing covariates, but not right censored covariates. In simulation studies, we compare these methods to the simple, but inefficient complete case analysis, and to thresholding approaches.

Using a sample of 406 038 entries of clinical trial data for over 21 143 compounds from January 1, 2000 to October 31, 2015, we estimate aggregate clinical trial success rates and durations. We also compute disaggregated estimates across several trial features including disease type, clinical phase, industry or academic sponsor, biomarker presence, lead indication status, and time. In several cases, our results differ significantly in detail from widely cited statistics. For example, oncology has a 3.4% success rate in our sample vs. 5.1% in prior studies. However, after declining to 1.7% in 2012, this rate has improved to 2.5% and 8.3% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In addition, trials that use biomarkers in patient‐selection have higher overall success probabilities than trials without biomarkers.","inCitations":["ef4828de93e60809068d0a5d7709208872681ef2","98488f9bd8f096607f08c103f4429d36d9c7e0a3","fda1d2571c7b8a026baf61803c8403dc6e1c00fd","db8c1bf1f531f9279ad508022468b811a380dc13","7b8ab71602a1787d8cb6dab81a9f6de7819748dc","858bf69172cc755ac40fa2a88811cd5241bd5142","a20eea154ae75bfc34f1a9f9ac6465a8dff6c224","fdc5ca5999c7a53a9062369e24f1ef5f7d8af314","3a03444587f0f26080e59ebecd12f9405c7e8bd0","c4ae7c3db1dd7425bd3a95ee25aa06eb2b147692","c615556cb238bad03d0538519159600fe727c903","b388c44a0eda6da015ce57979e43bf6ff97c6703","6cbbd7004718fc273a9d31c1596e331543b36875","0db35829a97edb30a94f74eafde315f92f81a2e6","84188a8a4ab512b2d137e832e0bc329f8712a97c","ca7a4a58268411d6d750ff5efbcff7f0608e319d","1bbbf51755a0a5f70759612d14a047616f2e77ef","f48d9310f0772bc86578a12859c6b364b5b9dd43","a8e504158e32f605553d6a457b3146e285e9321d","136217aaac38846e608298b04f154ae097dde20a","089b26e9f42de2c337be48cb516510e990eeb094","41f8da7d2a67235fa5d06f28d44b1714d4a79290","348074ef840ccac35470eef8a41532ce38db6501","a8d6c7df3c55bfc31f0bcf48a773ca285833ac48","793d9b6887fa12c8a0185e81c3add02ad9b8d3d9","e3d8447d061ca6c9ff82bfdf2c6843a559f4f833","1893489b0ef97567340686b92c65796fcf0bc193","d66de52a3178436e20c98e135e681b0d7fdb6dd6","25072be606287c783340d8d5be02b10e728124a3","29cb14f5698d7064bf5876e07b8153dba0197b84","4123b9e3634b9b25fedc71924edb8381270e7cd7","d4a38061f949e8e62b63354d0b5aa23d670c3ea7","79820b913c319be8ca1dd52b6f8273788b2bbb61","efd919e3798aaf233aa4b05ed59d56023f83ce1d","ea0edc7d976b6a6fdeb5fcbfc70a2647375d799b","0ed2a613ddacb8c01ddfc7f80ab372e96153774c","5bc4aa9e6db42f13eecaa0d9d30eb7b36a9cbf8a","dd79eecb91a7322bb9b8014069a0ab155838dc39","c5936f06963fb4c0a04b44808038c4122de76a1f","450664c424a28d1b919adfdfd08f73662c1d1dd2","bfac668043ce65a7da108afc6d605a5b601a71d3","4a6559df03c5ede896f5e0f431ee1031e0095ea9","9bada2133fc0308893aa1aa90ade86aa00d63121","b671c5622e02f0c4e9dac24116a5a3c9db7b392e","7028ae16f8762b7a9f626ab6f06b91076a63d0a6","0e5dbea68e5ac47b332192423a438b428a90d152","b8ff471c39a1ed1132a49ce1ed014668bd75d657","1ee509b486100cad2c0267912c77b696596048ad","87c80904579108e9ebecf05d78e83497e78030a1","5273f0cb7c002fd09f4cf00ac3511c738ccf99c8","2848ce51587b6a253d04ab95d5259c332a756564","3cf606d0691fd78bf58733abef528a370dc1574f","3f50794245b99bf57952dfbdfbb08370f8818dea","89bca5d7af90864c8367920765147e6da7569435","adbc4667ccdc94bd410a6dc54dd565cd65e2aba3","f750513f5acab9a5024135278591fa484517727a","5db384c7786cdb4c56cf3adef35c022df0e63974","7ceb08b743d271f12629252daba30dc5aaf73d5b","7eb36cfcbe3faff54fc65926fafe2b2dbcc2dd09","cff762ebebf11c3049323f7720fe54e35cbe6747","6bfc71cf909c3fd53c84563891d6475b5d98f6b5","c32c40e32a386e739bce0b86d0805bf8effc4d41","f384a05f079ede226b71705b2d3e23d46d3539bd","6b9f3556fe444fad8dc14260e4739d6743931b90","16bba17b75ee2d0a6da75212fe66931915aef9bd","ccd96e6290ddfb37a8bd44ec5673a84eadb06572","a587b3fbe97322ac5f7c2d6864ecf207a284f36b","b5904cd5dbf73b8d5ff13517de490c292d877ee0","638e7b68b874f5825a43f045fce4c17f9b3159da","9e01d1c7d1088361e80817cc006861d5bb79c2fd","0e40df56d80c5256eb42b9b91c0045247d478070","8847251fa845dfb42d797e1737330ede1dc9a942","3e966a7064d4fda6e439a31ae9e3396d98c751c8","1c5841972fbad008c7ee3358812420cff3ff5be2","d982c07e35759601a6a200b43cc1744013409ef5","083683b63916962dd2d57402def743b65e0ac11f","232e4e29e68e85d90712174fe5e4cff54ea3d94b","7a9633125d55b45c4d5556e8b08ef9a0947fcddb"],"title":"Estimation of clinical trial success rates and related parameters","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069"}

This paper proposes a semiparametric method for estimating the marginal distribution of the time-to-event that does not require independence. It models the conditional distribution of the time-to-event given the truncation variable using Cox's model for left truncated data, and uses inverse probability weighting. We report the results of simulations and illustrate the method using a survival study.","inCitations":["bdac1dad2164847a026a578e58bedd0606009239","c4b1bbcbdff24af75f1755ee39db37fbdf577dfb","dad05eeb9b98a36ed0a63f35bb2be8cf74ac2c52","341ca1161457ca4a5854c2725a731a4ed825ce8e","dc05c0128ef2a411e219dba6822494b304805407","94c33b406463aece0a4518bd3c3e90780a2944ec","2b62b4a0d1e777ded2395f17710c07261abb0be6","847bb8c0cd0644f8ca031b634f88013a110c78fa"],"title":"Survival Curve Estimation with Dependent Left Truncated Data Using Cox's Model","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1312"}

Bounded outcome scores often have a non-standard distribution, e.g. J- or U-shaped, precluding classical parametric statistical approaches for analysis. Applying the logistic transformation on a normally distributed random variable, gives rise to a logit-normal (LN) distribution. This distribution can take a variety of shapes on (0,1). Further, the model can be extended to correct for (baseline) covariates. Therefore, the method could be useful for comparative clinical trials. Bounded outcomes can be found in many research areas, e.g. drug compliance research, quality-of-life studies, and pain (and pain relief) studies using visual analog scores, but all these scores can attain the boundary values 0 or 1. A natural extension of the above approach is therefore to assume a latent score on 0,1) having a LN distribution. Two cases are considered: (a) the bounded outcome score is a proportion where the true probabilities have a LN distribution on (0,1) and (b) the bounded outcome score on [0,1] is a coarsened version of a latent score with a LN distribution on (0,1). We also allow the variance (on the transformed scale) to depend on treatment. The usefulness of our approach for comparative clinical trials will be assessed in this paper. It turns out to be important to distinguish the case of equal and unequal variances. For a bounded outcome score of the second type and with equal variances, our approach comes close to ordinal probit (OP) regression. However, ignoring the inequality of variances can lead to highly biased parameter estimates. A simulation study compares the performance of our approach with the two-sample Wilcoxon test and with OP regression. Finally, the different methods are illustrated on two data sets.","inCitations":["79074b3edd75aca5a56746f15af499fd1911604c","48117a47e79d235ad4a04cbed40a233212d82ca0","f9cf158580f9fb224344c955e10a9eab4f64bef6","d9257165672b0832df1261d3b2df32ed2e406479","3ac63e45c4fd389b3f3b933e9ce53a3751c07ec5","0c2d407e75a7ea25c677e54168d85ac79997e9a0","707d3168ac7f5e54bfd60cfe2c66acbe007e19d7","481ec3b1c0755e6c67796c6e1a08d83d015ba3d2","7010c7f731f6e42f7051e1703da8eac26a03417f","9246b8d3992a87742069e113d4d40fdf1ff2c6ae","780bcb7bb1cf99b9dc2ef74cb744e81aec92fb38","fd5374e785c472f2ab1cca2d1a47c70ca21b6e68","7668e8e5fa24b3df461a880295b77bcf6cad7ea2","2bb4b700a9e142ce7dd9dcb866bb50a0a9bbc7ce","f0ab25b8420223cc0981c807cb0bf7299ccd346d","47cd721dc7d164d6d8d4a42651eb4785e57a34dc","c079e733b0dad3f429d0da85928b424a0e1af9f0","624322b30c750962cfa5ad80c63ff50a479b1b5e","bf1897e535fe3d42c2f661279753ac5934640efd","a8b98bfc40d3d14a4d2ba5c93ea3d32430133186","18eb2cff2518ce8e4d84b8adc7be1f3543f0df9f","6bcc6e3834a55b36a937e9e02cf9b38f46410d49","5599a3d8bc874e86819a139776ecf6ce697225c1","52d50a5b4797e6ab0c5bad592bd7b6006c72bb32","52ac9cf0f4d86d68df717beafae0bb145ab67368","747e4a1cd3cce0baccec9f9e0b4570a30bbd3921","7c32ac3bb2fe511e12ea9e0bb9d6ce5fe919dcc2","7e56eb8528862be976bc28993cfe631d9b71f9cd","7bd52ba9b447cff4a165e53c34bd8a398e95e86f","bc1c57dd139fa1ce3b97b0921dae4299f568c0d2","b69f27b69bfc4507901920dd45ba0250e046dfd6","9cb352e3efe32955101db7d251f274746734eddc","5d19ef326cc710d6156bc400a4f816d05c4ee5c7","700160238eed4985408a087a2a349cc8c1a26185","1aed46e14718163ca983cff369c86ab16c7656da","147d7574cf25d33ff008fce8fd394771b7211fcf","50112ef92fec089f14d462cc9fd08b9097b61088","02c3ced2c1dc3454a60201f562b07455fc9b397a","b565a1144d8f8aeaeb65fa0346e9d138470590e1","204969ba24a8b7e34f5dcfd87eb6efd7e857a520","c10db09702ab0bfaea433b9bf2b8e906656b86f3","1483d2b1e8e77682c87034d9826daf91f1bd43ba","6089ccab38145a1f2b3cfbbb82c82591f27ae51d","f12f471ef621261866961e55e68be531e03defff","8cf5b4161f3530acd0c0f0db45c5c4edac453378","efaf453c1844e6ebdc9be9223356a7c38cc9c003","1692126ab05c23e4915ff75ec823d3308f954df6","46c9a1109dd3958d1c02018d88a7375e34c18f8e","25c954d47ee8ec4270c15a700bc19de23e55534b","b1d0ef461c40377346931bb9fb822f3c335e9d91","e996773d6706fe4a5bd072c5eb70734c4a239970","6b6e806ad4b06f906f617e1e764e5300b946ad64","7942be93210be8ac14c66ada07084698f834c8c8","fff6ace1dd60480dce0f7b3ba995fbebd1ba4283","96a6f5fdae9d7899b7140122ac93c2f959cceffe","28df08652a7c156c265fd99fbb8598d735671c77","09e48749fad720a26ff7c8d58a795221e5a0bbce","7b0b4f03c2a953dc8f364d2384f4a109d3f7dd91","2e4ce4142de1e33ad81a81ea4435dd564b949b89","b45cabf0cdc4861bbb6d09affe8c5900011a9615","fc38229bc40efb23263c757f1a8fc070e231015d","ce56143b9a309772d7f89fd980f37d83de39c41b","a2ae5c148ada7772f86afc9035011e856001fb0f","19bfd9902ab33d404624581db1a7599a7c1d9bf9","a29551470391dbb2e7b3cf9e2c48299ca6675e25","d03b2d1035a568a4f34949908f2289324b3e8a4c","386c413d116cf9f91e969924d666d22ceb1614a3"],"title":"The logistic transform for bounded outcome scores.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj034"}

The study hypothesizes that the majority of Tanzanians belong to a low-income group and that any expenditure on cigarettes or tobacco is at the expense of basic necessities, especially food. To verify this hypothesis, we first compared various expenditure patterns as well as household size of nonsmokers and smokers. The results showed that the majority of nonsmokers and smokers belong to a low-income group and that the mean total per capita expenditure (proxy for income) of nonsmokers is slightly higher than that of smokers. Similar results were observed for per capita food expenditure. On the other hand, the mean household size of nonsmokers was smaller than that of smokers suggesting that smokers should have spent more on food. The per capita tobacco expenditure among smokers was 7.73 percent of per capita food expenditure. We estimated a multiple linear regression on the determinants of per capita food expenditure. For each cigarette consumed, per capita food expenditure would decrease by 67.7 Tanzanian shillings (0.08 US dollars). People who smoke and belong to a high-income group (interaction effect) tend to continue to spend less on food. People who are less educated, who are rural dwellers, and people with a large household size, that is, poor people, tend to spend less on food. Given that the majority of all respondents are classified as low-income (more than 54 percent of total expenditure spent on food), one might conclude that expenditure on tobacco in Tanzania is at the expense of basic needs, especially food.","inCitations":["8eba623ebecc59d2048d9bcb1f830ad45b7040f1"],"title":"Impact of Smoking on Food Expenditure among Tanzanian Households.","doi":""}

Definition and estimation of the correlation of treatment effects were developed in linear mixed models and later extended to binary or failure time outcomes on a case-by-case basis. In a general regression setting that covers nonnormal outcomes, we discuss in this paper several metrics that are useful in the meta-analytic evaluation of surrogacy. We propose a unified 3-step procedure to assess these metrics in settings with binary end points, time-to-event outcomes, or repeated measures. First, the joint distribution of estimated treatment effects is ascertained by an estimating equation approach; second, the restricted maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the means and the variance components of the random treatment effects; finally, confidence intervals are constructed by a parametric bootstrap procedure. The proposed method is evaluated by simulations and applications to 2 clinical trials.","inCitations":["7c648476ed5add5ba466ea0be1c2a0e4ad2dc2c9","b2cf4ef5b4fabc28ca4638fe3a0853e78b59a6cf","3a8cd5bc30d9ea22aabf47c2c137063862528803","711a2fc38173e3940f0cd6251d26380669b06168"],"title":"A unified procedure for meta-analytic evaluation of surrogate end points in randomized clinical trials.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs003"}

Although many studies have noted potential sources of heterogeneity in genomic studies, to our knowledge none have systematically investigated their intertwined impacts on prediction accuracy across studies. We employ a hybrid parametric/non-parametric bootstrap method to realistically simulate publicly available compendia of microarray, RNA-seq, and whole metagenome shotgun microbiome studies of health outcomes. Three types of heterogeneity between studies are manipulated and studied: (i) imbalances in the prevalence of clinical and pathological covariates, (ii) differences in gene covariance that could be caused by batch, platform, or tumor purity effects, and (iii) differences in the \"true\" model that associates gene expression and clinical factors to outcome. We assess model accuracy, while altering these factors. Lower accuracy is seen in CSV than in CV. Surprisingly, heterogeneity in known clinical covariates and differences in gene covariance structure have very limited contributions in the loss of accuracy when validating in new studies. However, forcing identical generative models greatly reduces the within/across study difference. These results, observed consistently for multiple disease outcomes and omics platforms, suggest that the most easily identifiable sources of study heterogeneity are not necessarily the primary ones that undermine the ability to accurately replicate the accuracy of omics prediction models in new studies. Unidentified heterogeneity, such as could arise from unmeasured confounding, may be more important.","inCitations":["116b75bfc1a7913154a78bd31977d2be1d7db822","14526717bac486d66d8243f193ae80c9fcf8ffd2","33c668887105a74124b3b7f4ba0065179cae176a"],"title":"The impact of different sources of heterogeneity on loss of accuracy from genomic prediction models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy044"}

Recently, finite mixtures of such distributions have been considered as a more general tool for handling heterogeneous data involving asymmetric behaviors across subpopulations. We consider such mixture models for both univariate as well as multivariate data. This allows robust modeling of high-dimensional multimodal and asymmetric data generated by popular biotechnological platforms such as flow cytometry. We develop Bayesian inference based on data augmentation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In addition to the latent allocations, data augmentation is based on a stochastic representation of the skew-normal distribution in terms of a random-effects model with truncated normal random effects. For finite mixtures of skew normals, this leads to a Gibbs sampling scheme that draws from standard densities only. This MCMC scheme is extended to mixtures of skew-t distributions based on representing the skew-t distribution as a scale mixture of skew normals. As an important application of our new method, we demonstrate how it provides a new computational framework for automated analysis of high-dimensional flow cytometric data. Using multivariate skew-normal and skew-t mixture models, we could model non-Gaussian cell populations rigorously and directly without transformation or projection to lower dimensions.","inCitations":["0d1cce7c284d2c8b10cdfd82df608cd73cbfda20","87774b098f14739dca194841fe96cf26488c818e","e9d8e9bd6381d879c5de1028763bcd331438d978","8c1962e95782c9a8f0014e22d8400ef53e694f8c","729deba60e2107059fc99a49ab1a47a48a4d89f9","1f37e0c041197b3b3649adb613653c328d37ab3a","0b31c461933f90aefafcd4a4816d8d78ec796a3b","bda33f328b42299d44aa7fb278c6e49e253944e8","56210dc5cf712976017bf92eee465c38a2d42268","f2deb56e3cfc8fb75a2976a975b8c29859b7f405","6152cd5aab35d0ccc894ab5b9d23436148f7d6d4","8741d030e4c0804b1557d2050378299af83d66c0","f62ce064fe108c76995cd2bd50288c44247e0638","8b43745ce81cfac50d71e264560c34c9e8fdb2a6","86808095afb76e91e117302dfd2ff2a53cbe5e28","bff9a340fab6f56006d6921b3f2dd9b2f0658e9e","7d59d69967eca3603e2e81c0f05cd0617fd560d6","317df80a53a7150b4415acb04bd63576fdd30e6c","a97056446f0fc0c1b41c08c7e1a78820af52bf9b","9e5776e76f17f05f163bf64df9aa7b1a90c7e868","ee1c7e6270027202fe8be18048b1cb66c573dc0c","ae11c6d15a82a4c2a49986b1d257f94118b67994","d79e1ecc3b689c443568d30ee439291740572785","4cf0f38aafbc5ca31085524997a37938fe7712df","a76d425259fc7af34c8623036619a7a562cdb53d","f996c2e8750604c772b9bd60909e0ed1817741ee","88cb5ab5a2b7e22a42acbb9cef62254027f6b95a","9ff04ab29452451a16d4ac1fb8f96b31c65ecf01","e5e9713ab9eef1cf266f123e389085c899b985d6","e53ddfc8ca8b52bee2b3389c809bc4ff691b6264","6b85cf8eb795f849c9c859d1649311de66069c2d","43fa8c71e89b7366ef3fc8d51896c8b955781620","0c970bd78a7f4e1819cc53a90aac39140d20aa09","6680c857dc8dd709601e6325da7045998e92ea33","26a52f0be3801ff9a56d5dc5b4aa53cf35f7bf10","55e9b6e1960e5ade9e092323cc056263e2d74e6a","ef33d7ef68cf41f47c6d32dc9d499f5d964defc1","81b4cc8d6411ae9182dde577c6110c32303a96ee","f296e44176390aeaf7cfe37ac6c5a6ce37330b32","32cab18ff16274bfbb691bd81b811ef7ddf94395","da5163d16f4cd7dfae4acdd890be00d928a08a7e","6a22eeaf6da9b6fafc7a4b38704a59bcee208a17","feb2ccdf1608163c0518a8d35ea3eb463ef4cd2a","a16c66908621aadda242f9397ecf4c57aeaf7239","8d4d2fc2e8b60d09d042d4419905b4913ab7b83f","2bd4840c11d00aa53639cf5d81b6d8ec3d366588","02de35a73924ace30966d8193b637a11d40de06e","9cf601ac7f75e100dafed96344077da1a3d83657","3de22014457bbce164aafce871a97d939b782f61","392730b0127f320f1507108a580c2f476c52bb52","37b26b18bdcc9da6d33440545f6b7a1b53dad57e","b830592643b72fb0f2d39c07c40985b5ed3ecf65","51e0afee613607bc23635b70b3607f2a66f7c74c","2ed46aa6991e23d2008c3db9775701bb38bdb62e","1703b3f71bd815a5763d7375e1a51cce0e1d4a25","f22681e3096a5c424393132564723d5a1db36038","5ce5e473fa358736cf3e99d51a855e151ce4c1ca","2784113cc7cb3864601d110d3670b28c136a1e4b","6da2fed3e7a5ffabea21bbca76a03afda7ff54ce","fb090f1e5a46e1778c394d9570c4a44a7ff1c53e","12b5eeae99d188af76ccc2836a84f953170080ad","bb79ab832a617fe36b9198c44b16436e0710d770","bb8c034470bc940c57467fb9350732eb1b0b5f75","6202198a1650021cacbea9131ec63d3fcb43f213","e56c42b13114c5818fc02206c34583eb2d6eecd5","d17dba2381aa35fce10ebdc6968775f7fb2c6b68","bf6f79df91005da34678eedddbd1564bb1dc5a36","9949bdd55d0a5536511d231e0aedd9b38c7b8136","6b714b5f1ac7294da9b8c9dc340ef5fc6dce2407","30cd29c2ead772dafd1cd3ea5c791973c4161d36","c34a9a950737cfea719d4bd59462d51cf1a18c78","21c643eff09d7a866b1cd627c8c7c012c5dc516d","21dbf352376f0dff2499150bf872db04b6c6591a","459fa2a8b384167111efca126f3a3fb8f8c567d2","bf3b711c4dfa8cb67fb685b05a884566a27cc2aa","89cd195547dfeeab50487b838101f6009bffbe79","ee03365c15c3d75ccd6328e943fa67c8356d916d","3a95066c045ea74c6d54bf482370e589435c1da8","749111bdc7f711d007df1d8ee6b600fe0e87a94b","2d03160713341bbd8070d2add2073a9ad585cb28","a95c5f7b4ee64d469e2812b91103fa22e859a495","2bf479249e3112e198299b89e7517047dc367573","a182f3c7fe124ff84276ced24ade35c5d82da876","f861a925904a261198f3b65a04679edc507fc6a5","241e86103fcbab6955631b46c342c85accb2616a","671143cb76f15a1519343fe5ccfe38fdd86f33ff","b55718178e5273e4f803281235ddc07c53fd0dca","7f22aac17dc9ee275d7278c510a4858cf58e1cd4","5e047ecc42112645bf881bb18512967402e17897","03ca9c690c7ad4b07bc8600a0f36d693d02d6718","3b35d856401a37f66fc4bd81044240639ccc3d2c","57e9d38ef7d07742fc4ec3ac3d2c24012ebd10ce","121e68fa5ef228f89c9fe8bb2f91bd4ce940d918","978f2ce09899aa6b8c388e9c4cfeed6500b33c62","c92d634199fcae7a4e7e5963e020573e6bd8f696","0cad6fa72181aeb228406ce0b515d46c9421ca71","c0667c4b2fd0d39c9c856e9363f03474a21ee78b","1b4f1f0797e1540618c541537e8ccd3e198b0d1e","a51989a8636aa9b315246e2fd94aa3d98676341a"],"title":"Bayesian inference for finite mixtures of univariate and multivariate skew-normal and skew-t distributions.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp062"}

Usually, such reference ranges are created from data sets of independent observations. If multiple measurements per individual are available, then ignoring the within-person correlation between repeats will lead to overestimation of centile precision. Furthermore, if abnormal measurements have triggered more frequent assessment, the data set will be biased thus producing biased centiles. Where multiple measures per individual exist, the methods commonly used are either randomly or systematically to select one observation per individual or to model individual trajectories and combine these. The first of these approaches may result in discarding a large proportion of the available data and may itself cause bias and the latter requires the form of the changes within individuals to be characterized. We have developed an approach to the modeling of the median, spread, and skew across individuals using maximum likelihood, which can incorporate correlations between dependent observations. Heavily biased data sets are simulated to illustrate how the methodology can eliminate the biases inherent in the data collection process and produce valid centiles plus estimates of the within-person correlations. The \"select one per individual\" approach is shown to be liable to bias and to produce less precise centiles. We recommend that the maximum likelihood method incorporating correlations be used with existing data sets. Furthermore, this is a potentially more efficient approach to be considered when planning the future collection of data solely for the purposes of creating cross-sectional covariate-related reference ranges.","inCitations":["d9f2d8658364114ede0352efb0c2c6a3be36e917","68c051820a63bbe4bcabfa8cbd8a54b1c2fb644b","8fc5d98e1df31c2e72805bf59623239d1df34799","a9e69ccf22f3e9a0e03c2df6ab531d09aabf5213"],"title":"Creating unbiased cross-sectional covariate-related reference ranges from serial correlated measurements.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn022"}

The results from interim analyses can be used either to modify the design of the remainder of the trial or to stop the trial as soon as sufficient evidence of either the presence or absence of a treatment effect is available. The circumstances under which the trial will be stopped with a claim of superiority for the experimental treatment, must, however, be determined in advance so as to control the overall type I error rate. One approach to calculating the stopping rule is the group-sequential method. A relatively recent alternative to group-sequential approaches is the adaptive design method. This latter approach provides considerable flexibility in changes to the design of a clinical trial at an interim point. However, a criticism is that the method by which evidence from different parts of the trial is combined means that a final comparison of treatments is not based on a sufficient statistic for the treatment difference, suggesting that the method may lack power. The aim of this paper is to compare two adaptive design approaches with the group-sequential approach. We first compare the form of the stopping boundaries obtained using the different methods. We then focus on a comparison of the power of the different trials when they are designed so as to be as similar as possible. We conclude that all methods acceptably control type I error rate and power when the sample size is modified based on a variance estimate, provided no interim analysis is so small that the asymptotic properties of the test statistic no longer hold. In the latter case, the group-sequential approach is to be preferred. Provided that asymptotic assumptions hold, the adaptive design approaches control the type I error rate even if the sample size is adjusted on the basis of an estimate of the treatment effect, showing that the adaptive designs allow more modifications than the group-sequential method.","inCitations":["2e81a089c935c75f77bab0f20cb98eb428679aaf","1e477a442b4dce2c360b2c4a4e20871a70b1f1c1","d99bf49016fda796df0a616206bd87eb7cd74b3c","3573d4931991b500fbda504de4e471323b8c85ef","f0a90c2e6c1ffff5b3924a621cc2e74973cef70e","a07766e1d1a9fc819a748de9fa1f7bb3a13d344a","6dee1744237c92a91ea1974a97e167a4306bb069","1ee4017fb7a11f13b87f0af5c2052e62bc7bcfa9","e0477a2ef4106dcb63616d8e4eef1c8c7cb82291","65e59f760e564c02daa0a8e77231ef31cfb86f14"],"title":"A practical comparison of group-sequential and adaptive designs.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200062859"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2010,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In recent years, Bayesian response-adaptive designs have been used to improve the efficiency of learning in dose-finding studies. Many current methods for analyzing the data at the time of the interim analysis only use the data from patients who have completed the study. Therefore, data collected at intermediate time points are not used for decision making in these studies. However, in some disease areas such as diabetes and obesity, patients may need to be studied for several weeks or months for a drug effect to emerge. Additionally, slow enrollment rates can limit the number of patients who complete the study in a given period of time. Consequently, at the time of an interim analysis, there may be only a small proportion (e.g., 20%) of patients who have completed the study. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian prediction model to incorporate all the data (from patients who have completed the study and those who have not completed) to make decisions about the study at the interim analysis. Examples of decisions made at the interim analysis include adaptive treatment allocation, dropping nonefficacious dose arms, stopping the study for positive efficacy, and stopping the study for futility. The model is able to handle incomplete longitudinal data including missing data considered missing at random (MAR). A utility-function-based decision rule is also discussed. The benefit of our new method is demonstrated through trial simulations. Three scenarios are examined, and the simulation results demonstrate that this new method outperforms traditional design with the same sample size in each of these scenarios.","inCitations":["6c1eeb7e3fceec02f58df7437d96b78dac99cc1c","0ac2b18b77a7da0a4f0354b02c1d88f844a4d58d","f97430875ea3ba8e2cb1f1a0cf17f2c5f1acb28e","b49913cfdf710617c46da4f1763d1433fb73f2c1","b89cabd48ac044493ee0b5aad19a3cd3244b093c","4300c570bd2ab3fe1fcd844a589d6e3889740e71","6ac664fc29d8776ff4c8c81912c4f6774448bd90","64489bc57e8917d6188714c2fd36bbb15aaf93f2","fe702c36320a86139292c2ae7f87e1810e744913","4f8d7ad66144917f3beb663b0b14d074f2d924c5","c57ab35f2430d7ec61f4a7d8007d925abea76ae9","5c1ca56091734e40d64ffa8eaef0b448e3d433f6","685c7e0187c7034f7d43b94137f8b80b8a3f7f82"],"title":"Bayesian adaptive dose-finding studies with delayed responses.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903315740"}

The focus of this paper is on tree-based treatment regimes, which link an optimal treatment alternative to each leaf of a tree; as such they provide an insightful representation of the decision structure underlying the regime. This paper compares the absolute and relative performance of four methods for estimating regimes of that sort (viz., Interaction Trees, Model-based Recursive Partitioning, an approach developed by Zhang et al. and Qualitative Interaction Trees) in an extensive simulation study. The evaluation criteria were, on the one hand, the expected outcome if the entire population would be subjected to the treatment regime resulting from each method under study and the proportion of clients assigned to the truly best treatment alternative, and, on the other hand, the Type I and Type II error probabilities of each method. The method of Zhang et al. was superior regarding the first two outcome measures and the Type II error probabilities, but performed worst in some conditions of the simulation study regarding Type I error probabilities.","inCitations":["00a725ea7d5b3c9c5c61ff2ed87f0a072d4f9ad4","e5463bc67686795e8020754110e6f608f8e6bcb7","c44e662bdeab4fe63e6398d3f63880cc88a7ddfd","d259606fe50d219e4f08a57f231b70a619bb3bc8"],"title":"Comparing Four Methods for Estimating Tree-Based Treatment Regimes","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2016-0068"}

DIC is shown to be an approximation to a penalized loss function based on the deviance, with a penalty derived from a cross-validation argument. This approximation is valid only when the effective number of parameters in the model is much smaller than the number of independent observations. In disease mapping, a typical application of DIC, this assumption does not hold and DIC under-penalizes more complex models. Another deviance-based loss function, derived from the same decision-theoretic framework, is applied to mixture models, which have previously been considered an unsuitable application for DIC.","inCitations":["04de1f2231997dc65048f751c170acf038a6240f","a20160d92cfa50da51a13ef1a413aa21374067e1","6e6a6dbba044503690425265c948ef3a81c64dad","184ce7e417ee83f6e8ae224b8825fae90d9a6339","e22c53241eebffe3adf9ed7382bca4ee4d44fd83","c19baa2972685f7586282589e778634cf419dc7e","4ca2536d77b8568a3b0a461b44925d7f8a9b921e","74d5da54650a066ce38cf69a0925b05fccf02050","59d956e71130fa786c83b7e094aabdf044bab72a","587cbcfead126461cb2021b6345048bcea3db699","3bd7df16f966dd843f5f27ab633a8a9cdd48c6a8","f27d86695c5faa919458a924189054f973f44b73","ee357524120c556e46efcb8f8e822d3454380fdf","892f81a4ace22cf41c1a78ca5f3b9c00996ff5f3","a331ef5b33133ce26c9853a84d0ecc3763c68e31","55c8be0cbe6dbfdb458fba5dbf8f581f86ef9e8a","2dab388ccbc3657c28c7bcac19c017047ed69e73","6c51e6e29d973bc718ea2846a47bc5432c5c92c3","6d937f970a2c88e1e90283ce20137509c17a06da","5b80afc2de26000a6215fba44a673ef3e76ce243","8497a272dcce833da99c3a35e034bd30a13fe498","282c832dd77780fe06efef6c9d6fa936dba4ed23","d9349064d1da19897038e0cbe25abbf26a8f10e7","08f0bb591638076f946f527ecb595f8e9c425763","7622dba7337cf32319ce634a1b8038ff1aba52ab","14594d19d3474c00366d3afc64a140c406e14627","497ab62b171ed22af4cdd73d3168f34c723421dc","9409593508d19a1fe7d7e1c1fb5c7797afb0d80d","6526a94d1002785113b9d5283e7c5df38fc918b7","ace06a097a1580c52285f7033f826f2eb85f7120","01970bb26194d93372b1aea4e1f7ec4e60dbfdc3","fe0629f05184b133cbb67943600e4ddb5de33cf2","60e5e955db722fc557c1781df6bffa7155ca5b56","f707640571f512722a86975629690c8cf5de191b","3629dc61d3b8782a1cf9fb60c411619f5531eeb4","2d899f85a33375c68d5b96c3f265c8b82eb41060","ce3e17341e0e49a447f62ff3fcfdca1de12cac27","b20f61062ad3beefb0eda38d06bf62316ea764eb","3d1e827a20456fe8386d6d1b13f67cf8bdba6eb0","52cbd20e034bc0b3f8db681aca1c9bcc61ea1f21","45c872e44b9e74bd1a9d4d55c2ba38a2f5a684fd","1b2616086fdfdb97e01778a2b5f5f19627be6388","0a3f655beb1f8cfd1c669ea70c7f402e177c5241","259beaf87706ec07368f7717ce94bcaafd248b0d","8a17c71f3128d92427c293ef3c02dc9aaec5d4f1","26bbed976399580c3e4149e6c423dc687907d050","35fe9b4ca1d4b64d5bd71b53c5d667e8a276f620","f480aa1beb04af5900201ad8efcbff96a9ce62ac","7295abe6b7d5f0a147504c3a8ed711948ce8e157","d55ed71053a72e1d4675f5c3eaa1be89eec4f06e","026fa5ce1faa13f90201e82f6197290debf81a1e","2b1a1921bdc9f607430cfac2b28c3e1588599bb8","36cdfdc2a98c88f88d33f45371cabb572a1ba1ff","deadf99b76a7faafa0a955cb26b5385ede1eb4b0","c5b083a6410645887782b09795b445f1b4c8b7d7","fb14bf1d5a864892b2bd83615d3cb71d80756c98","ab3801590f39d2d589230ae7bacdbb10e7bdd6bb","1f3d7142101c82c5b7942cf269493c60e8c9c50a","edda02426a16ba216fe787f66ee1214d62831e46","2ca7ac03627de6c1a9a2acfbf0ce0afd4bb655e2","72a5a9c3aae67ba6fee626f49ffdc2e2309ae15c","cdba3a9e8de3bf3ef040f7492b8ea3d84464dd16","953468c6f2559f70b98088bc84471f5b9d90d778","a7f317109065a18ab4bbbb755d28b18e3b9d69aa","78fdcf7f961f806e58d67f7f0066f990f10b8ef4","14062ac6620571efe4b2f86d36599c4e418d2cea","a24539c78b055567df760c1063875ef61cf63815","47b72ae458c2030676fb674d2dffb0ba329a59e2","dfd6d1e72fd72ac4f5d25bdbf09bb948505e3fe3","e7ffeab74f9ef9376504fd4bf5cf5ed8a70b6400","40b173b922049ff0e71116010bba08002ad58981","6eb38005ef97958f0aad429ff71ff9a081474d24","7d5394672f8cf021f4be2d115b4adb93049902f3","ca8c45f12aa2b7d52b37f9e84613b9e169848ea3","73e1948a1783422b6d63e35c22e458defd5b0fd7","3c66a59337b4fbdd832bb88d2f2b0673e6017bc0","4bf0e9786d6638dc7d4b1fc929def68da9003c4e","f49ae93bf8b3ad762753dd5b400328e2d1b82662","7dcfb678f03a5446647cbff075c7eb02221959ad","ca01b40af4619c1b66611951c63276c119bdc316","fd7da1210aaa6bbc05434bdda5e7171d6012bd00","ed624510362304203be5cb155de326769d8d9912","455558122a597df3db59b13edd1663dbf514880d","73195dfbb620c2563b1e082b605b27e6c4ff60a7","45deb942768879d42f6f8ee67d21559df2eebe80","c4dedaa53af48043c064c6cc5d5aeff18106fd55","dde1ecd993ca59c4c0bdfa31c65440b891bf8681","2751705a6458031dbd5a9ede7316dfc347d011ee","acab87276992b70150bb794b9a15d8f15c4cf9a9","40b4f52c5c2a56cb3323458050a9ece8993fe75c","3d5edc6c3f3187ede5007c3be2e8cd0678e1d818","ea78905761d0a195b3c8c3851d9ddb5cc073a483","0de04c5602ccd5ec0755a654294e5e04a1a96924","bd142a3e59117047daec4928270be8c7184f5670","63da6b9af8fccaccc8c08da8f40fda6712e8f949","b39fe6cd985f61237a455404756d4039c2da563b","c49b4ced50e527e2e8bd1a0183e9a832b01dcc74","11dc0c04a27ec8f864893086430329efa7448335","e08ef25bf66cccf60a7e455870c9e0261c73bb08","1e7e73f203e50ecfbab7e333c80e1798f5b6a1bf","7774423b57aa591d4fea83eb9aed79a2f2e0b087","ab057236ade5323cc560b9b2d601e07b7160ea94","3452260df8ee4ec87d05286110f7b5532c2876aa","d4e9f9fc15d24f9fb0e2969a2681f2568d84428c","8c1962e95782c9a8f0014e22d8400ef53e694f8c","9009f1515f7c078c7c089eb2d4124139dbdeed55","39f7e8219e75256b34be2994068eebdbf58c9093","e1cdb0a859fd5dc38e22a7fd43363d9f6a1a29d6","a77cf190625eb49de94ea6ede1cae4907f98e5ea","691a863afd2c9772e6ccbbb51f6fcd7206bce251","fe10dfb401cb612c3af871dc8958e57f52344ddf","2449629d85e772733f8f53e1b4b604308a69737c","f81ae405a9ef3446d44367c44fec6cb61e769f6d","8324f81ae60efa97271303c5152dc4fb8859e2e5","12b44625ba3615b570e3f358937a97df3aede220","594cb54fae9041ad877c7ad7dc9a0bad7

This is based on the Fundmental Bioequivalence Assumption from FDA that if two drug products are shown to be bioequivalent, it is assumed that they are therapeutically equivalent and can be used interchangeably. Recently, there are a few statistical considerations for assessing biosimilarity. In this article, we propose a new method based on a frequency estimator to evaluate biosimilarity; the large sample properties of the estimator, the power analysis, and calculation of the sample size are considered. Under a three-arm parallel design, the power comparison between the frequency estimator method and the other existing methods is studied through simulation, and the statistical test based on the proposed method is more powerful than for the other two methods. Simultaneously, we compared the relative performance of the three methods, and the empirical consistency and inconsistency probability are obtained in evaluating the biosimilarity.","inCitations":["3485c87ea4c014b50e93759f1e9f021421a083d6"],"title":"Frequency estimator for assessing of follow-on biologics.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.941985"}

The underlying theory as well as the construction of the coefficient are explained. The a(d) coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, regardless of the number of scale points, raters, or items. With some limitations the measure of the within-group agreement of different groups and groups from different studies is directly comparable. For statistical significance testing, the binomial distribution is introduced as a model of the ratings' random distribution given the true score of a group construct. This method enables a decision about essential agreement and not only about a significant difference from 0 or a chosen critical value. The a(d) coefficient identifies a single true score within a group. It is not provided for multiple true score settings. The comparison of the a(d) coefficient with other agreement indices shows that the new coefficient is in line with their outcomes, but does not result in infinite or inappropriate values.","inCitations":["131762db5dfb3fdbe164f6a2133bd3aaf66e675b","61dc02b0b31d812962893a8a25468886e0a61444","59d3e3e301ee142585dbbfa8b9678851a32541dd","95807c385ee4f7167b029704e938ab23377ab04b"],"title":"The a(d) coefficient as a descriptive measure of the within-group agreement of ratings.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X465647"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2004,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"A common objective in microarray experiments is to select genes that are differentially expressed between two classes (two treatment groups). Selection of differentially expressed genes involves two steps. The first step is to calculate a discriminatory score that will rank the genes in order of evidence of differential expressions. The second step is to determine a cutoff for the ranked scores. Summary indices of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve provide relative measures for a ranking of differential expressions. This article proposes using the hypothesis-testing approach to compute the raw p-values and/or adjusted p-values for three ROC discrimination measures. A cutoff p-value can be determined from the (ranked) p-values or the adjusted p-values to select differentially expressed genes. To quantify the degree of confidence in the selected top-ranked genes, the conditional false discovery rate (FDR) over the selected gene set and the \"Type I\" (false positive) error probability for each selected gene are estimated. The proposed approach is applied to a public colon tumor data set for illustration. The selected gene sets from three ROC summary indices and the commonly used two-sample t-statistic are applied to the sample classification to evaluate the predictability of the four discrimination measures.","inCitations":["e6c4acc6af7f2d880e3826447ab393f93fb282f4","64067cbc760d3acd0367a2399d3a84eabde81584","5508f7597d63b95ade057893f2e5495187a469b7","b61afdd0df28eda2090c320c10b69b666e3f4e5e","bff3a3360bc4c56eacaa495f1157875a5bc04749","79f29067cf8078c735928b5c16ef2cf54b4f4539","0f6aa9cff2daa2538d78d6b7d3679ff55776a08e","3ea5160839adde27eab46b96b2ec41ed8305ddb6"],"title":"Significance analysis of ROC indices for comparing diagnostic markers: applications to gene microarray data.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200035475"}

The standard approach that uses the time to the first outcome event has important limitations. Several alternative approaches have been proposed to compare treatment versus control, including the proportion in favor of treatment and the win ratio. Herein, we construct tests of significance and confidence intervals in the context of composite outcomes based on prioritized components using the large sample distribution of certain multivariate multi-sample U-statistics. This non-parametric approach provides a general inference for both the proportion in favor of treatment and the win ratio, and can be extended to stratified analyses and the comparison of more than two groups. The proposed methods are illustrated with time-to-event outcomes data from a clinical trial.","inCitations":["65f15ccf05271407deac7b6e168894b1c40d321f","c792b9a73a95aa54c3ab9f946c60e41142f7b56e","2872aa760849289f8aaa69d3e13cdd52225d16c2","2ffa601ddfbaacb9338ba930c15b7dc143accbb2","9cde63e84c90c34ee398e50bc6909c920d0df098","f3da1413a7101395d71f24c02d54ba1e78b0a254","db1fab6e465529789e83c092c58466547368a181","19ed79c5d99758b21fff0f863c670291cfa6531a","02e4d5133f82b4cc512fe2c095e433e7dba2a464","0c9461d0458c21e6bd835adf3fe0b3bff222f125","581e1da72bc2e781bcaceb340ecd734d7aa04e08","2ee24b5bd585516b301e57aca43cd08d66dfe845","4b8404811dafb2194618fe991607ca86aa5a2939"],"title":"Large sample inference for a win ratio analysis of a composite outcome based on prioritized components.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv032"}

In these settings there can be a trade-off between a smaller average treatment effect with broader enrollment criteria and a larger effect with restricted criteria but longer enrollment duration. Identification of subgroups will often use a clinical decision rule, for example, biomarker cutoff, but may be imprecise, that is, with sensitivity and specificity not simultaneously 100%. We evaluate the impact of including attenuated subgroups on design operating characteristics and illustrate scenarios where overall trial duration may be shorter by not being restrictive.","inCitations":["911657179b72575fd8f0b6ba9edaa5bfd754ee08"],"title":"Sample size and screening size trade-off in the presence of subgroups with different expected treatment effects.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.860154"}
