However, fMRI data present some complications for statistical analysis and modeling. One recently developed approach to these data focuses on estimation of computational encoding models that describe how stimuli are transformed into brain activity measured in individual voxels. Here we aim at building encoding models for fMRI signals recorded in the primary visual cortex of the human brain. We use residual analyses to reveal systematic nonlinearity across voxels not taken into account by previous models. We then show how a sparse nonparametric method [bJ. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B71 (2009b) 1009-1030] can be used together with correlation screening to estimate nonlinear encoding models effectively. Our approach produces encoding models that predict about 25% more accurately than models estimated using other methods [Nature452 (2008a) 352-355]. The estimated nonlinearity impacts the inferred properties of individual voxels, and it has a plausible biological interpretation. One benefit of quantitative encoding models is that estimated models can be used to decode brain activity, in order to identify which specific image was seen by an observer. Encoding models estimated by our approach also improve such image identification by about 12% when the correct image is one of 11,500 possible images.","inCitations":["669a6f4d4f196d91a77ee01f30fbb9011470cad7","1f910ef5c4a60e4aed0933016a93288414b9c548","959ce8d3aa1364a11dbc0b5428ba2b69a91f6336","e7b0fe88367b404c40cbe8b1449de0eeb3664086","9505b8f2f91d48a6b69a6ec86e88d1a4fa411c40","6cf4af32494667fd921d3e906cda51bd4f3175ec","b41f221cf10ae30f6abed57347ed2884b5c88804","8fbdaf83ad45d027faa0beb6c3bc6ee1eeff9c54","acb67d5c480ca5cabf2bd1fc5aec1cc77d8f3e32","b4886184516dcf43515ea97aa4f3c55b3b0903cc","354a2e15eb6788b6adc0332af568a125d162cdd4","6f3f047d505ac79e643fe2c8883839cedbbe76a0","eece9711608071d59115152ba2f644419b4ce618","96165da2c3bd299aea29f89adff8a2c3d260ea6e","0af8ec346f279595f973ef0c190c6c27ef9714d2","319e45d20bc81bffbab3d1f2fe060ad8fa6072ad","5ca9d80c9d50d39fdb9a13d90c3ec4d89eea5bca","19c6a93d714f5871b1a66cf2c71a71d611348c24","0c8671883cab32860a6f6390ff4b2aa5c61b4175","acdc1f0be0ab78135831aa36ba396ac047f26b95","91307f9010aa2198a33de400037cbfc001bf8c2e","5d8f3b150854503d9cf0eaaa44ec3287e7a831c8","3761ab8d1b1a36e15e59fc9bb20f30e92c2df6ed","d67bfb05c25fa75b242ab276ffbdd647ac441cf6","ae42a9a3b8955b5393ba84c91d13018eac1bb677","db72a5702dc6831c4b3d2f81539d278c674f5fbc"],"title":"Encoding and Decoding V1 Fmri Responses to Natural Images with Sparse Nonparametric Models.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS476"}

A \"conventional\" analysis of covariance in this setting uses each baseline as a covariate for the following outcome variable in the same period but not for any other outcome. If used with random subject effects such an analysis leads to biased treatment comparisons; this is an example of cross-level bias. Using a postulated covariance structure that reflects the symmetry of the crossover setting, we quantify such bias and, at the same time, investigate potential gains and losses in efficiency through the use of the baselines. We then describe alternative methods of analysis that avoid the cross-level bias. The development is illustrated throughout with 2 example trials, one balanced and orthogonal and one highly unbalanced and nonorthogonal.","inCitations":["4b27be826907668521733741748d84301f3a9762","7bf0b1c3bde4cb360af74fbc2b81ca926866a6da","e491d383313e23762acda654c982ae583aaa09b1","315855fd3ad14cda8a1dfd31a88812b220e03377","b88b778ccc3eddb364ef0f54308cf98a9cd902ec","36a30c7cfc28ddc952de2a78c33b23e0d18dd311","24f3c5e3824c4f84322bac02fdaef6a03f6bd407","6630c49bc98840a1a7d3b05699c52715897dcb81","8c13dad27bd18c0479567c790924637c9504f5f1","594df9b93675ba05f7c889b33347a5ae6cb31a77","8b4ae8216d5dc027c31adfd0890695f8ab8da606","dff4d13fb4b10fd2e8b212e667f5021a4150b925","3ef8c2b876cd00e49d0289af85b727d8964e6b9e","da5ddc2b35a3949ce264347c21b099438d8dac47","232e033ddd611b3ba179426df67e80a30c459d31","f4803fbc46261ec8860ff0c6e9c258deb325189c","5233a0ad8f807efa0067c751a439eaba91128c33","066f67510fdbcd2464145751b978594fd237cb4e","c60b2af438dcdcf21a537447faf0697e4e85c6fa","a58efd0ade4ed828970ca41309673df54abf03b0","2f46a563af85606b7039ad1473192a5d1bec44c1","778d84084149f494581a400f6daacac9ed0bb163","6bd029ec21a0c450b08078cff71910ce84637df6","2e3b4eafd0ea2f7c435d5be740e9d02d2b1531ff","eaa0e250baa4257d0508af87fc807462ad0c933c","a013c226f16bcd9e74d1a3de17d0e0632453f3fb","98d7c31794109dd7c1feceeee2755cf71c2e86c9","8a23596fb742cc3ce27bedf467b8ecd1d8c65a76","21e0acbf9d02e189f13dc71e19a927ad667455da","d1ad9d52a2fc98aaead91c668078361afa65feb7","9622ca75b69f1544353aea3afd3c0e9d87578b63","358c4f26c320b1e9e5c4fea2f62e3e4fcb56c5fe","2804b9ca13c7f87e93a2f173ec6c6513583ac2fa","ef1568c75dcf6fcf953d35e55fe113de681d5245","eee60ea0c968752362121113d6d76f11dc3e3d27","e86b9bb5584058ee6ffc7f9f74ce6a54202e2dd7","ef936851cb28b0516a94b526d645e6a811c0e11d","6e66136187dcb22429a7155dcd8341352441b2ad","599d273a1a25165da4a2599bec725766bcda9580","1e9968cc34c1547d480e23bdd24e0d324fb4e309","c5aed5b1f28a25da7c5e8907a03cf60e99bb184b","9f40934eddf86ed3896e6ac249c08365f74a7578","7935d9e6a7db0b64444d1698b67bfe7f5c534e2a","ac5688f6bfbb2c764a5fdd1ed3eb4be340ee6f26","47c66a80cb4bfdb4c7963b4cc4040823a0e6bce6","55386910ea7f80ac734cff6b73beac83b2d04ec6","a1cf2c534afbec0e492756d7b85fe32fd1601a1c","e7d5cc85d48bb7862676961e18348d9a14bef488"],"title":"The use of baseline covariates in crossover studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp046"}

One requirement for its use is that the sample sizes of the two groups are fixed. This is violated in some of the applications such as medical imaging studies and diagnostic marker studies; in the former, the violation occurs since the number of correctly localized abnormal images is random, while in the latter the violation is due to some subjects not having observable measurements. For this reason, we propose here a random-sum Wilcoxon statistic for comparing two groups in the presence of ties, and derive its variance as well as its asymptotic distribution for large sample sizes. The proposed statistic includes the regular Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic. Finally, we apply the proposed statistic for summarizing location response operating characteristic data from a liver computed tomography study, and also for summarizing diagnostic accuracy of biomarker data.","inCitations":["47149c72c6cb336f6d75555db7d2cc47775e188d","b9b57395f5d18fa0f0633b31ea470e1d7aa4853f","149bfecbbc59e6f365e3eaa0cb7322f49fee82d1","36aea059d866403aad21d80d1a0c6ccc1af33be8","ffafe85329f79cf7c819651608f497b2e95a7d78","fa43f08510e16f58fead984ac1da3c1b3060efa4","da347408e74a8835d843d89bea78c76447030f0b","f52bec003258f684fe2be0943d7a9d01b1ebf857","1737ee650676814d42159051adf470208687e66d"],"title":"A random-sum Wilcoxon statistic and its application to analysis of ROC and LROC data.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2010.06.011"}

Various model selection criteria have been proposed, primarily in the non-Bayesian framework. The deviance information criterion (DIC) is the most popular criterion for Bayesian model selection and model comparison but has not been applied to Bayesian multiple QTL mapping. A derivation of the DIC is presented for multiple interacting QTL models and calculation of the DIC is demonstrated using posterior samples generated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The DIC measures posterior predictive error by penalizing the fit of a model (deviance) by its complexity, determined by the effective number of parameters. The effective number of parameters simultaneously accounts for the sample size, the cross design, the number and lengths of chromosomes, covariates, the number of QTL, the type of QTL effects, and QTL effect sizes. The DIC provides a computationally efficient way to perform sensitivity analysis and can be used to quantitatively evaluate if including environmental effects, gene-gene interactions, and/or gene-environment interactions in the prior specification is worth the extra parameterization. The DIC has been implemented in the freely available package R/qtlbim, which greatly facilitates the general usage of Bayesian methodology for genome-wide interacting QTL analysis.","inCitations":["2bed844a4288cff0b710f3bf050ee400a2c3df46","eaffa08e01b8499d2d2b2ea81fe02bba863abf1f","06b7f73231a8a25b9ca384c7a09afd185b2942f6","582f8c2f289067986f3449702748411c3fcc64ce","ec0a0b437f229e33e03752cbb296fd023ba609cb","bf00aba054e3b02a7ce899cc18bfcbef1604cbd2","d0e4df4e519324994b7289f08593b6c26c5e15be","dd5acc67f8426fdc409a3aaa140ef9ea52108f1c","dd192709771971204586c35f6a23238bbbd6a62b","2f9c71feaf399443a1a025fbb17039eba9e6cd21","9339111f4c1f4df1230d7e866e7df9b1d05dd02c"],"title":"Deviance information criterion (DIC) in Bayesian multiple QTL mapping","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.01.016"}

A common assumption on the spatial correlation is that it is isotropic. This means that the correlation between any two observations depends only on the distance between those sites and not on their relative orientation. The assumption of isotropy is often made due to a simpler interpretation of correlation behavior and to an easier estimation problem under an assumed isotropy. The assumption of isotropy, however, can have serious deleterious effects when not appropriate. In this paper we formulate a test of isotropy for spatial observations located according to a general class of stochastic designs. Distribution theory of our test statistic is derived and we carry out extensive simulations which verify the efficacy of our approach. We apply our methodology to a data set on longleaf pine trees from an oldgrowth forest in the southern United States.","inCitations":["94bbfb6d2ab059f1836cbd01e0b9f57bec7114bb","2089b3b312161830c15da923827604e9f00e61ec","56a8e8911ee0066616f8da573cd9579ecfed5279","6c032365e61adee963669ef3bf9cd8220acd4d4e","26d9865867071efe7373ff599435eea398bff57b","eba8e9c8decbf7adc8b81edf75843c5d5f7479be","30e8004305df8f3df14be8fcbff9a0cdf6c83b7f","476798570a39ba76bc74c4628d89d125f714a801","59165fee3f7094c9aa6fed300d842b85a635e0de","d24c7e70a28b1c2a5c25a8018e4079c7cee284f5","a9eba510d08e9a614958b8b12fab337745f06c98"],"title":"Testing for Spatial Isotropy Under General Designs.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2011.11.013"}

However, the PL method assumes that the censoring mechanism is noninformative and when this assumption is violated, the inferences may not be valid. We propose an expanded PL method using a Bayesian framework to incorporate informative censoring mechanism and perform sensitivity analysis on estimates of the cumulative incidence curves. The expanded method uses a model, which can be viewed as a pattern mixture model, where odds for having an event during the follow-up interval $$({t}_{k-1},{t}_{k}]$$, conditional on being at risk at $${t}_{k-1}$$, differ across the patterns of missing data. The sensitivity parameters relate the odds of an event, between subjects from a missing-data pattern with the observed subjects for each interval. The large number of the sensitivity parameters is reduced by considering them as random and assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with prespecified mean and variance. Then we vary the mean and variance to explore sensitivity of inferences. The missing at random (MAR) mechanism is a special case of the expanded model, thus allowing exploration of the sensitivity to inferences as departures from the inferences under the MAR assumption. The proposed approach is applied to data from the TRial Of Preventing HYpertension.","inCitations":["a0519d4fc2c33112907bfd9809893375ccab7064","7191ad7625acb37e9a71402efbe475cb51390dd7","4ef1ad17c21c85461c5418680253dcb6f2ba5b7d","46f7e6916518ffc88f515b610921685e58abf8ac","a65120c5715ad96c560b7b563a48bcb5939950ff","09e64df8009a1a0e933c1cd4e6b4215999926142","ad87fd09c6ef28776c8a8bd06b7d03f90b6c4214","76fe953e5aede8ac62d97b3e346d27ab4532b1a6","157fd204417e778d1bc04f518f7fc90bdcf24691","2be90e21fb283e59f20e22be7ee326611bbb2960"],"title":"A Bayesian model for time-to-event data with informative censoring.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr048"}

A random frailty is included in the point-process intensity to describe variation among subjects in baseline rates of event occurrence. Covariate coefficients are estimated using estimating equations constructed by replacing the integrated intensity in the Poisson score equations with a design-unbiased estimator. An estimator is also proposed for the variance of the random frailties. Our estimators are robust in the sense that no model assumptions are made regarding the distribution of the time-varying covariates or the distribution of the random effects. However, subject effects are estimated under gamma frailties using an approximate hierarchical likelihood.

Several authors hypothesize that African Americans have a more rapid growth rate of prostate cancer compared to Caucasians, that manifests in higher recurrence and lower survival rates in the former group. In this paper we propose a Bayesian piecewise mixture model to characterize PSA progression over time in African Americans and Caucasians, using follow-up serial PSA measurements after surgery. Each individual's PSA trajectory is hypothesized to have a latent phase immediately following surgery followed by a rapid increase in PSA indicating regrowth of the tumor. The true time of transition from the latent phase to the rapid growth phase is unknown, and can vary across individuals, suggesting a random change point across individuals. Furthermore, some patients may not experience the latent phase due to the cancer having already spread outside the prostate before undergoing surgery. We propose a two-component mixture model to accommodate patients both with and without a latent phase. Within the framework of this mixture model, patients who do not have a latent phase are allowed to have different rates of PSA rise; patients who have a latent phase are allowed to have different PSA trajectories, represented by subject-specific change points and rates of PSA rise before and after the change point.

The method allows the user to draw inferences and perform sensitivity analyses when the missing data mechanism cannot automatically be assumed to be ignorable.

Missing item values often occur in QoL data. A common approach to solve this problem is to impute the missing values before scoring. Several imputation procedures, such as imputing with the most correlated item and imputing with a row/column model or an item response model, have been proposed. We examine these procedures using data from two clinical trials, in which the original asthma quality-of-life questionnaire (AQLQ) and the miniAQLQ were used. We propose two modifications to existing procedures: truncating the imputed values to eliminate outliers and using the proportional odds model as the item response model for imputation. We also propose a novel imputation method based on a semi-parametric beta regression so that the imputed value is always in the correct range and illustrate how this approach can easily be implemented in commonly used statistical software. To compare these approaches, we deleted 5% of item values in the data according to three different missingness mechanisms, imputed them using these approaches and compared the imputed values with the true values. Our comparison showed that the row/column-model-based imputation with truncation generally performed better, whereas our new approach had better performance under a number scenarios.","inCitations":["91096ea6a1d682a802961595f03f45f508004f80","ce39bcc7237ce1644b3200817be9b8e48ed3572d"],"title":"Missing item imputation for quality-of-life instruments with application to asthma quality-of-life questionnaires.","doi":"10.1002/pst.333"}

GEE uses the Liang and Zeger sandwich estimator to produce unbiased standard error estimators for regression coefficients in large sample settings even when the covariance structure is misspecified. The sandwich estimator performs optimally in balanced designs when the number of participants is large, and there are few repeated measurements. The sandwich estimator is not without drawbacks; its asymptotic properties do not hold in small sample settings. In these situations, the sandwich estimator is biased downwards, underestimating the variances. In this project, a modified form for the sandwich estimator is proposed to correct this deficiency. The performance of this new sandwich estimator is compared to the traditional Liang and Zeger estimator as well as alternative forms proposed by Morel, Pan and Mancl and DeRouen. The performance of each estimator was assessed with 95% coverage probabilities for the regression coefficient estimators using simulated data under various combinations of sample sizes and outcome prevalence values with an Independence (IND), Autoregressive (AR) and Compound Symmetry (CS) correlation structure.

However, accounting for clustering features when generating datasets for multiple imputation is a nontrivial task, particularly when, as is often the case, cluster sampling is accompanied by unequal probabilities of selection, necessitating case weights. Thus, multiple imputation often ignores complex sample designs and assumes simple random sampling when generating imputations, even though failing to account for complex sample design features is known to yield biased estimates and confidence intervals that have incorrect nominal coverage. In this article, we extend a recently developed, weighted, finite-population Bayesian bootstrap procedure to generate synthetic populations conditional on complex sample design data that can be treated as simple random samples at the imputation stage, obviating the need to directly model design features for imputation. We develop two forms of this method: one where the probabilities of selection are known at the first and second stages of the design, and the other, more common in public use files, where only the final weight based on the product of the two probabilities is known. We show that this method has advantages in terms of bias, mean square error, and coverage properties over methods where sample designs are ignored, with little loss in efficiency, even when compared with correct fully parametric models.

Here we present a general solution to this sampling problem when the CTMC is defined on a discrete and finite state space. Specifically, we consider the generation of sample paths, including intermediate states and times of transition, from a CTMC whose beginning and ending states are known across a time interval of length T. We first unify the literature through a discussion of the three predominant approaches: (1) modified rejection sampling, (2) direct sampling, and (3) uniformization. We then give analytical results for the complexity and efficiency of each method in terms of the instantaneous transition rate matrix Q of the CTMC, its beginning and ending states, and the length of sampling time T. In doing so, we show that no method dominates the others across all model specifications, and we give explicit proof of which method prevails for any given Q, T, and endpoints. Finally, we introduce and compare three applications of CTMCs to demonstrate the pitfalls of choosing an inefficient sampler.","inCitations":["43e4625d60f197ce624d0387077dae3539c37b23","3acef3773227b56d184f62ed2afc8b8c49b4948c","1696ec2e60105f2fd279b8319853fc5ba392f600","0f9d9f87c4934afecd0586ea8ca9d5fa3dc3b2cf","bea97228e43f38abfa20907c93083571544850fe","51ee9c1343d4c1136d711edd58f2250652b64cd9","7f153691ad5c93f0e08f4bbf0c3f5fc198b66667","5d6a10f99a56977f6f6277c988c899726e04afec","564f8da2dbc16f731a80a4292b0e70de60b12a74","11401fe30cd87ccba86d7de7693aa4bc55cfdd3a","71b014538f55e74b57a7b5134ebbb357fda14968","b8b231efb7b6b77e5f33026252d15d8d0a9ba52c","9e9de6acbe7667bb61427c198a1fcf6094cd9a6e","81cdf6e92591787daf8d6e46925de63e74421c6b","bc7c5c73c960fe92899600015a8b1b370826b80e","40fa39da6673bfa4762e5d16ad4990c2cd9a5b50","d82830e2b8cb711ba6c8dea1e58d957148e69e8e","e63dd445cfcde1e9deae07d34f04894892daf2b1","3d2011a4148fcb26945bde5fd8d2919ce99d07ff","0ee8d1a2fd35c946f9f9ac1eded93e4e061b23b0","3901ac3c020e3fb2d228d1b0f8e5d5d338778e40","7b191e9a5f8058f55782a3bd268b2e3521e5de89","c64325d21a50dd281ff985a397d7875a7847f47a","d51196d9018fca24a42cf79c83d8598964c81ed7","26ac1a9097af80afe6504e62aa401deb31151592","f914f3b13a8a0c6e1bd7bfb6f5cc6704b6841cba","128b619f738164f02c76878276696642dd52e16e","f7327e219a12ec3353d157b328db0e45745a3cae","7aa841327aafc1098772ce488186c59faa742931","bf4a12a2ee1ce27ffece94034090c354dac36795","a040785a2467301dae7a8eb00f11d1d00ae6c836","99d75123d7f1d0b980fa54b98a83d8c0b0309c3e","091c019e7a77e6b746bd9ea52c9ce4958ce93949","b8f7e127c310626b9b6f591dfb5127c971f4207e","d05d865b5eaf4ad2ff5d168e6907fcf13e95346d","e48f905a3dfad43c030d8ba0ef217cb8058ba5e6","3d386bd18101c231008fa95cdbe035cbc3068585","96885488d96b81a7635d9d538384b6f75e8cdc2e","6b537e15a13b8850c26f2142fed5357726698133","7f91be40fd2fcee4141083b50624269c4ae69769","af4649d2f7d886394ffeab9b6ea538216ba674d8","d9518ad1a0d7e5d7f2f9ee4e2271c47579f2216c","4f5aad743cef238a28503dace74faa3023b79810","28ece4b67147c36dbb2ccc236257c7702330ef04","d6d8a89afc4203e1d2e0c1f46d1c2cd3e656f39f","ff6deded7497e4282b0e9b054c66b2e12ab29a51"],"title":"Simulation from Endpoint-conditioned, Continuous-time Markov Chains on a Finite State Space, with Applications to Molecular Evolution.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS247"}
