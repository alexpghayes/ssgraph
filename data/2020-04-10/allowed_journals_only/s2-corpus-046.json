This article considers combining a proof of concept (POC) study and a dose-finding (DF) study with a control treatment. Conventional DF study designs sometimes are not efficient, or do not have a high probability to find the optimal dose(s) for Phase III trials. This article seeks more efficient DF strategies that allow the economical testing of more doses. Hypothetical examples are simulated to compare the proposed adaptive design vs. the conventional design based on different models of the overall quantitative representation of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. The results show that the proposed adaptive design tests more active doses with higher power and comparable or smaller sample size in a shorter overall study duration for POC and DF, compared with a conventional design.","inCitations":["4c3b4c2f13828794a26331f125cbacd3facd4c5b","1ef75ff2839eebfdd08ec659bdae2b3b8d5bd330","b2d398cf788dbd32b8af47c74e9478d4c53c5830"],"title":"Seamless Phase IIa/IIb and enhanced dose-finding adaptive design.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1094807"}

We discuss and show how desirability functions can be used to assess a patient overall response to a treatment using multiple outcome measures and each of them may contribute unequally to the final assessment. Because judgments on disease progression and the relative contribution of each outcome can be subjective, we propose a data-driven approach to minimize the biases by using desirability functions with estimated shapes and weights based on a given gold standard. Our method provides each patient with a meaningful overall progression score that facilitates comparison and clinical interpretation. We also extend the methodology in a novel way to monitor patients' disease progression when there are multiple time points and illustrate our method using a longitudinal data set from a randomized two-arm clinical trial for scleroderma patients.","inCitations":["e948cf8132c2a1d769d7cc01ea315de6aa92fa73"],"title":"Data-driven desirability function to measure patients' disease progression in a longitudinal study.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2015.1077378"}

We propose the fused lasso additive model (FLAM), in which each additive function is estimated to be piecewise constant with a small number of adaptively-chosen knots. FLAM is the solution to a convex optimization problem, for which a simple algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a global optimum is provided. FLAM is shown to be consistent in high dimensions, and an unbiased estimator of its degrees of freedom is proposed. We evaluate the performance of FLAM in a simulation study and on two data sets.

Analyses of binary multiple sclerosis lesion maps are typically \"mass univariate\" and conducted with standard linear models that are ill suited to the binary nature of the data and ignore the spatial dependence between nearby voxels (volume elements). Smoothing the lesion maps does not entirely eliminate the non-Gaussian nature of the data and requires an arbitrary choice of the smoothing parameter. Here we present a Bayesian spatial model to accurately model binary lesion maps and to determine if there is spatial dependence between lesion location and subject specific covariates such as MS subtype, age, gender, disease duration and disease severity measures. We apply our model to binary lesion maps derived from T2-weighted MRI images from 250 multiple sclerosis patients classified into five clinical subtypes, and demonstrate unique modeling and predictive capabilities over existing methods.","inCitations":["87321ce9927f84ab4fc5c729a5f1a504a6c84764","cc9b728a09316c7c1992c294c1dc3c2b59f6721a","628398e6fb872425c5b4802f1cbba83cdcfa26ec","92480b0e0492fcf305769774afa2b514e4a38b02","815c5105fa1a502d0c7505642eef0d2f4476254c","6b5ff61cb4b7768d03c30a9ed6d7c69fabda28a9","f57af454fa331a965f90225af79561f95d7f3eb2","682fb8b5b54accae0453a7a19ba85d52aa9ccee5","80e8b585518bee1438624538d06107b068cbe4b7","6545d8408f3ebc1169d777bc9d8db47e921d0c80"],"title":"Analysis of Multiple Sclerosis Lesions via Spatially Varying Coefficients.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS718"}

They showed that when dose proportionality (or linearity) cannot be established, their proposed slope approach is useful for evaluation of the degree of departure from dose proportionality (or linearity). In this article, we propose the use of slopes between the dose level and the initial dose (baseline), which we refer to as the baseline slope approach. The two slope approaches are compared under a parallel group design by means of an ANOVA type F-test and other tests. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has a satisfactory small sample performance.","inCitations":["697f3d1c9c0efdd5230f415da2542a141c9222ab"],"title":"On the assessment of dose proportionality: a comparison of two slope approaches.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600629906"}

The advantage of using latent scores as dependent variables of a multilevel model is that it offers the possibility of modelling response variation and measurement error and separating the influence of item difficulty and ability level. The two-parameter normal ogive model is used for the IRT model. It is shown that the stochastic EM algorithm can be used to estimate the parameters which are close to the maximum likelihood estimates. This algorithm is easily implemented.

These SNPs, or the particular regions of the genome they implicate, are then considered for further study. We demonstrate through a comprehensive simulation study that the inclusion of additional, biologically relevant information through a 2-level empirical Bayes hierachical model framework offers a more robust method of detecting associated SNPs. The empirical Bayes approach is an objective means of analyzing the data without the need for the setting of subjective parameter estimates. This framework gives more stable estimates of effects through a reduction of the variability in the usual effect estimates. We also demonstrate the consequences of including additional information that is not informative and examine power and false-positive rates. We apply the methodology to a number of genome-wide association (GWA) data sets with the inclusion of additional biological information. Our results agree with previous findings and in the case of one data set (Crohn's disease) suggest an additional region of interest.","inCitations":["aebf1d0dce345b39b78cbdef663922a2a7546567","8bd04b3f6e611076e85c30fc292e2c264a28aa7a","b33b1763554792028156ec460d2db9932e675194","1e7feec07c5f89576fd7cba758545ba6dd7be0ff","afb77d5b9a50c3a50a0bb413e9fc8ea4c8cb3220","dbcbacb0323a94564c2bbf3a44e689211d26f5a8","d34ac9e135d086be7558b9c0494197a26aa2a63e","024c6e45aa73c4958b3cac19c989a08be1914919","223213755f4d28183e4af0ff5c9b695794e652a5","048a7d3f717e5b13ff0f841966cdc396e24cce13"],"title":"Exploration of empirical Bayes hierarchical modeling for the analysis of genome-wide association study data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq072"}

This paper proposes a novel statistical model which provides both a metric for the intensity of anger and an approach to determining the quantitative relationship between anger intensity and the specific behaviors that it controls. From observed angry behaviors, we reconstruct the time course of the latent anger intensity and the linkage between anger intensity and the probability of each angry behavior. The data on which this analysis is based consist of observed tantrums had by 296 children in the Madison WI area during the period 1994-1996. For each tantrum, eight angry behaviors were recorded as occurring or not within each consecutive 30-second unit. So, the data can be characterized as a multivariate, binary, longitudinal (MBL) dataset with a latent variable (anger intensity) involved. Data such as these are common in biomedical, psychological, and other areas of the medical and social sciences. Thus, the proposed modeling approach has broad applications.","inCitations":["59396ee5bf681586929bb424de9f77122e662c99","598f26c54a082b63339f535d9d63b15b88ead6c9","0617eeda4529b11402e3044a8a4f63113ee7c30d"],"title":"Statistical Modeling of the Time Course of Tantrum Anger.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS242"}

This permits direct assessment of the range of possible values of model parameters, such as the recombination frequency and allelic associations, in the light of the data. In addition, sophisticated comparisons of different models may be handled easily, even when such models are not nested. The methodology is developed in such a way as to allow separate inferences to be made about linkage and association by including theta, the recombination fraction between the marker and disease susceptibility locus under study, explicitly in the model. The method is illustrated by application to a previously published data set. The data analysis raises some interesting issues, notably with regard to the weight of evidence necessary to convince us of linkage between a candidate locus and disease.","inCitations":["c646df90cd3632d8f25d8089399d0702bd240214","053d343ae3f16b43224748d535e41773f71144e4","29a079a5423063a3f084c2737f2d11c282e1c01f"],"title":"A Bayesian approach to disease gene location using allelic association.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.3.399"}

Although screening programs have existed for a few decades, there are still many unsolved problems, such as how age or hormone affects the screening sensitivity, the sojourn time in the preclinical state, and the transition probability from disease-free state to the preclinical state. Simulations are needed to check reliability or validity of the likelihood function combined with the associated effect functions. One bottleneck in the simulation procedure is the very time consuming calculations of the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) from generated data. A practical procedure is presented, along with results for when both sensitivity and transition probability into the preclinical state are age-dependent. The procedure is also suitable for other applications.","inCitations":["41fb7904e51746d1f32e30a60afc1e9979e3fe83","f84775a3d070cc1c71357d5ef234cacb59239346","560ee81102ab021c5790fe4e15b379077a73048e"],"title":"Simulation Procedure in Periodic Cancer Screening Trials.","doi":"10.22237/jmasm/1130804160"}

The principle is to reach individuals in places and at times where they gather. For example, men who have sex with men meet in gay venues at certain times of the day, and homeless people or drug users come together to take advantage of services provided to them (accommodation, care, meals). The statistical analysis of data coming from TLS surveys has been comprehensively discussed in the literature. Two issues of particular importance are the inclusion or not of sampling weights and how to deal with the frequency of venue attendance (FVA) of individuals during the course of the survey. The objective of this article is to present TLS in the context of sampling theory, to calculate sampling weights and to propose design-based inference taking into account the FVA. The properties of an estimator ignoring the FVA and of the design-based estimator are assessed and contrasted both through a simulation study and using real data from a recent cross-sectional survey conducted in France among drug users. We show that the estimators of prevalence or a total can be strongly biased if the FVA is ignored, while the design-based estimator taking FVA into account is unbiased even when declarative errors occur in the FVA.","inCitations":["69b98cfd85442db46786c8d6435eea7001d18b44","1b8684bab937c7ffb49781b2a14df8c566fa8b13","946671d7027ba99b0b8321cae09863f19cfc93e1","191f47ec6bfc4de3232d27e97573ee8bac5f4050","4a4db2cf3ed718f18313b4dae5240c6bd16ed5f3","0d0ac36b4589d7914c10ee3901e8593accf57d67","7c75b6f25120e8eec59d5422bac3b48e220b4607","e37f5fed5c91e1f4dd7d03a92c7f32f3e77b9b6d","f60f8241d26a03692e5de7aef48bd03560175d32","3c09c73df1225d0d4b3e80acf6d297f8c54e75c3","f374ec4a2e08780b9fe175f245d5f54bd2276e17","1ad07e1377d2e137afea00ec4702dfcfecfc8746","8babbb4636d08f4241aa902cdac32955c16fdaab"],"title":"Design-based inference in time-location sampling.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu061"}

Consequently, a wide variety of other types of data including many household sample surveys are used to estimate health and population indicators. In this paper we combine data from sample surveys and demographic surveillance systems to produce small area estimates of child mortality through time. Small area estimates are necessary to understand geographical heterogeneity in health indicators when full-coverage vital statistics are not available. For this endeavor spatio-temporal smoothing is beneficial to alleviate problems of data sparsity. The use of conventional hierarchical models requires careful thought since the survey weights may need to be considered to alleviate bias due to non-random sampling and non-response. The application that motivated this work is estimation of child mortality rates in five-year time intervals in regions of Tanzania. Data come from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted over the period 1991-2010 and two demographic surveillance system sites. We derive a variance estimator of under five years child mortality that accounts for the complex survey weighting. For our application, the hierarchical models we consider include random effects for area, time and survey and we compare models using a variety of measures including the conditional predictive ordinate (CPO). The method we propose is implemented via the fast and accurate integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).","inCitations":["7d5394672f8cf021f4be2d115b4adb93049902f3","0943bf43875d5e65397a3afd05bc71411378d622","ff78893069bc587c65458bd5f195fde31b58f2a3","5bc46a38fc486560695e2c1a61ba9b8eb9a2cc10","cbdf8f4f6ece3c70fb5c0abd7c369a16f87e112a","c48bad1ede64bb1a17fc68e6c37f5fc2cfa6bf0c","c80c6612490c8cbf525a4526440483c482747af0","7ab4102991ebf7ce016dcc942198443f6a25faac","b64887d6026b7dd5f45dcf031dac6d7d8e9496ea","edffa77d782e3d2ce8e965b1242ab884451589f4","7abcf312919052a2507b5d2dabd70dd9c5437fe8","f79c39557281caa935ed218ee04ca0936edddfb0","e7706e6f6895cdee68f47170a720042d3f988178","079dcb36dff2598e993af77bc90024ef0c40ecb1","43d712f088750243d96eddca7e057658f07df4ac","89ee4e3ea0f9cff5f254fa9277f636ed2cf89b46","f0c154d7f7989376f21b57d371ccdec4d5c090c2","d4f249161b4faa7f89722a053c71556e87b6ddcd","91a4807a9ab31414cf6feed33da4af6c58dd064f","67bede4a989d2020911305c8a88db2f6596aad58","c02452da415b2f24d6cce2d43aaf15834e6e41b2","b77f0abcb7e1146a215b4dc592409c0465b25985","140f3865663a15ab19f9150abfcf229bf6e94df6","7ed52ba72c1146fa90c237a92b4d9dc4cc8f3529","9176951bf766529b52a5048095bc6a2803f91326","b82a9ab4807bec1d46012bd19c1609fe7a4ed4f5","94106907faa5615c5b4fe9c34590552ff6ef0f58"],"title":"Space-Time Smoothing of Complex Survey Data: Small Area Estimation for Child Mortality.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS872"}

Subjects drop out and the initial design can be quite different from the final design. Consequently, the final design can be inefficient. Single- and multiple-objective Bayesian optimal designs that account for potentially missing observations in quantal response models were recently proposed in Baek (2005). In this work, we investigate the efficiencies of the conventional optimal designs that do not incorporate potential missing information relative to our proposed designs. Furthermore, we examine the impact of restricted dose range on the resulting optimal designs. As an application, we used missing data information from a study by Yocum et al.

The low-rank structure in the coefficient matrix is of intrinsic multivariate nature, which, when combined with sparsity, can further lift dimension reduction, conduct variable selection, and facilitate model interpretation. Using a Bayesian approach, we develop a unified sparse and low-rank multivariate regression method to both estimate the coefficient matrix and obtain its credible region for making inference. The newly developed sparse and low-rank prior for the coefficient matrix enables rank reduction, predictor selection and response selection simultaneously. We utilize the marginal likelihood to determine the regularization hyperparameter, so our method maximizes its posterior probability given the data. For theoretical aspect, the posterior consistency is established to discuss an asymptotic behavior of the proposed method. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated via simulation studies and a real application on yeast cell cycle data.","inCitations":["bcb4efdaf254cf3e8bb2f36f7d399a4c5e46fb9a","78aef7cd1536a86d2e03fae22ae8c23f84c93d74","3cd5afaff43c5007da6d0be29a46daa642a32bdd","3365626751623135aa81db8a320a341bcc4873dc","9c5a9c11c2e54d8c1b24ae42ca76b6e2dbe9844d","2674837d750d9a735e455d01c927d44d6d4417bf","78ef98c3ff9a0cfc99dc26a796785eb3b82b59f2"],"title":"Bayesian sparse reduced rank multivariate regression","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2017.02.007"}

Recently, new methods for estimating R0 using social contact data and serological survey data have been proposed. These methods, like most of their predecessors, ignore individual heterogeneity, and are sensitive to perturbation of the contact function. Using a frailty framework, we derive expressions for R0 in the presence of age-varying heterogeneity. In this case, R0 is the spectral radius of a population version of the next generation operator, which involves the variance function of the age-dependent frailty. This variance can be estimated within a shared frailty framework from paired data on two infections transmitted by the same route. We propose two estimators of R0 for infections in endemic equilibrium. We investigate their performance by simulation, and find that one is generally less efficient but more robust than the other to perturbation of the effective contact function. These methods are applied to data on varicella zoster virus infection from two European countries.","inCitations":["52451f73b1cb73b9a1fc2a8715a5aad03b9b50f2","5fc586d9164ac5d1f92aa56bb43640a189900bcc","5a75a82ea8f6611ac08033bcf52a7c4524791e86","18d5313165807163df8c04822c9dd24be528f341","a1a6c0067edf3605299df62d104c31661bbccaec"],"title":"Estimation of basic reproduction numbers: individual heterogeneity and robustness to perturbation of the contact function.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs054"}
