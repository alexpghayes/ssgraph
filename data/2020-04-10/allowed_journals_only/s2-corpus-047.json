The finite sample distributions of these test statistics are unknown, because they are functions of correlated count data. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the type I and type II error rates. For a balanced experimental design, the likelihood ratio test and the main effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for microbiological methods demonstrated nominal values for the type I error rate and provided the highest power compared with a test on weighted averages and two other ANOVA tests. The likelihood ratio test is preferred because it can also be used for unbalanced designs. It is demonstrated that an increase in power can only be achieved by an increase in the spiked number of organisms used in the experiment. The power is surprisingly not affected by the number of dilutions or the number of test samples. A real case study is provided to illustrate the theory.","inCitations":["8c6bfa6d5d4161da473037e202a7182a2a00d452"],"title":"A comparison of test statistics for the recovery of rapid growth-based enumeration tests.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1581"}

Usually, the subject is permitted only one attempt to select the correct alternative. This is adequate if discrimination is all-or-none, but is not adequate in general. Two methods of assessing discrimination from multiple response data are described. In Method A the average probability of rejecting a wrong alternative is estimated. Method B is based on Information Theory. Both methods permit the comparison of tests involving differing numbers of alternatives without using a guessing correction. A probability model is described for relating the distributions of the number of attempts needed for such tests. This is relevant to one way of using the information-measure to compare tests. It is also relevant to examining the effect of the traditional guessing correction if the assumption on which this correction is based is false. The paper concludes with a brief consideration of tests in which there is more than one correct alternative.","inCitations":["307e14c85cc3602730b45975c51ff6f17e8261d3","b4fea59b65dfaf8067450e01a3cb413ab2a23c3f","969e89e13b30d0f1c9735e1b930469fcfb73933d","6b9a73dfdc55eac5904577512eceae25e89b44bd"],"title":"Multiple Response Evaluation of Discrimination.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1965.tb00696.x"}

Because cancer vaccines require time to elicit an immune response, a delayed treatment effect is expected and is actually observed in drug approval studies. Accordingly, we propose the evaluation of survival endpoints by weighted log-rank tests with the Fleming-Harrington class of weights. We consider group sequential monitoring, which allows early efficacy stopping, and determine a semiparametric information fraction for the Fleming-Harrington family of weights, which is necessary for the error spending function. Moreover, we give a flexible survival model in cancer vaccine studies that considers not only the delayed treatment effect but also the long-term survivors. In a Monte Carlo simulation study, we illustrate that when the primary analysis is a weighted log-rank test emphasizing the late differences, the proposed information fraction can be a useful alternative to the surrogate information fraction, which is proportional to the number of events.

Nonparametric goodness-of-fit statistics are generally based on the empirical distribution function. The distribution-free property of these statistics does not hold in the multivariate case or when some of the parameters are estimated. Bootstrap methods to estimate the underlying distributions are discussed in such cases. The results hold not only in the case of one-dimensional parameter space, but also for the vector parameters. Bootstrap methods for inference, when the data is from an unknown distribution that may or may not belong to a specified family of distributions, are also considered. Most of the information criteria-based model selection procedures such as the Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and minimum description length use estimation of bias. The bias, which is inevitable in model selection problems, arises mainly from estimating the distance between the \"true\" model and an estimated model. A jackknife type procedure for model selection is discussed, which instead of bias estimation is based on bias reduction.","inCitations":["96561666c831c4d442fc72b6092a127b5966a02a","21832faea0d2d1303c6d49053532b92a21c72187","a75b72b694bfc0dc1c7a520439d3416e6f9cc593","f4ab50402624a19b0424a83cd6fbda8a899fd0f8"],"title":"Resampling methods for model fitting and model selection.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.607749"}

Thus, unlike traditional criteria for tuning parameter selection, MGCp is not prone to undersmoothed derivative estimation. We illustrate a scientific application in a case study that explores the relationship among three measures of liver function. Since recent technological developments hold promise for assessing two of these measures outside of medical and laboratory facilities, better understanding of the aforementioned relationship may allow enhanced monitoring of liver function, especially in developing countries and among persons for whom access to medical and laboratory facilities is limited.","inCitations":["ae3f51037a98bb1ba7d369bb45c96aa10d7db834","1c68138f6d6f6debbc98cc0db0583e4edf1ad159","18ff81630634c8a9e9d82ef6cc2b03d541e402c0"],"title":"A multivariate generalized Cp and surface estimation.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu042"}

Increasingly encountered in regulatory applications are adaptive statistical information designs that allow modification of sample size or related statistical information and adaptive selection designs that allow selection of doses or patient populations during the course of a clinical trial. For adaptive statistical information designs, a few statistical testing methods are mathematically equivalent, as a number of articles have stipulated, but arguably there are large differences in their practical ramifications. We pinpoint some undesirable features of these methods in this work. For adaptive selection designs, the selection based on biomarker data for testing the correlated clinical endpoints may increase statistical uncertainty in terms of type I error probability, and most importantly the increased statistical uncertainty may be impossible to assess.","inCitations":["5bcbbe3ea67b80e1e3d5cf7ab64e7436a13d398e","e97db076c4af6bd446d09bc991597dd1b32fe335","10d3ad6256dde0525600c347bc4b5ef91b9b1c37","7208a0c4ab5e65c1ffa168dca813fdba28378968"],"title":"Some challenges with statistical inference in adaptive designs.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.925911"}

The covariate mean differences between the treatment conditions can inflate the standard error of the covariate-adjusted mean difference and can actually produce a larger standard error for the adjusted mean difference than that for the unadjusted mean difference. When the covariate observations are conceived of as randomly varying from one study to another, the covariate mean differences can be related to a Hotelling's T(2) . Using this Hotelling's T(2) statistic, one can always find a minimum sample size to achieve a high probability of reducing the standard error and confidence interval width for the adjusted mean difference.","inCitations":["b95d8386fac353604af96b91d551acf283d9bdc9"],"title":"The effect of covariate mean differences on the standard error and confidence interval for the comparison of treatment means.","doi":"10.1348/000711010X526575"}

Multiscaling takes into account the difference of abundance between molecules, and captures the dynamic of rare species at a mesoscopic level. We introduce an assumption of spatial correlations for reactions involving rare species and a new law of large numbers is obtained. According to the scales, the whole system splits into two parts with different but coupled dynamics. The high scale component converges to the usual spatial model which is the solution of a partial differential equation, whereas the low scale component converges to the usual homogeneous model which is the solution of an ordinary differential equation.

This TMLE relies on an initial estimator of the entire probability distribution of the longitudinal data structure. To enhance the finite sample performance of the TMLE of the target parameter it is of interest to select the smallest possible relevant part of the data generating distribution, which is estimated and updated by TMLE. Inspired by this goal, we develop a new closed form TMLE of an intervention specific mean outcome based on general longitudinal data structures. The target parameter is represented as an iterative sequence of conditional expectations of the outcome of interest. This collection of conditional means represents the relevant part, which is estimated and updated using the general TMLE algorithm.

Since survival is often extrapolated beyond the range of the data, inaccurate model specification can result in very different policy decisions. However, in this area, flexible survival models are rarely considered, and model uncertainty is rarely accounted for. In this article, various survival distributions are applied in a decision model for oral cancer screening. Flexible parametric models are compared with Bayesian semiparametric models, in which the baseline hazard can be made arbitrarily complex while still enabling survival to be extrapolated. A fully Bayesian framework is used for all models so that uncertainties can be easily incorporated in estimates of long-term costs and effects. The fit and predictive ability of both parametric and semiparametric models are compared using the deviance information criterion in order to account for model uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Under the Bayesian semiparametric models, some smoothing of the hazard function is required to obtain adequate predictive ability and avoid sensitivity to the choice of prior. We determine that one flexible parametric survival model fits substantially better than the others considered in the oral cancer example.","inCitations":["5615d394c22752a3da0395ae09a46e0d99b80edb","8a7890e9a57795acb5f7a83133ce89c0c0671cdf","9fba5a6d481588285559c85b6a7c759d724df4ce","b5593e8e0cbcf1eba3f9f9804624fa2e4836219a","4abb6ab17aa70734db583b5b1d9b7d92b9249e75","f3c2ff6e336614b1ba1706d5298bc1575097d2f9","533bf17e19a08febb7f3621233259e221f006939","b3af00deac49035f402e310894281f3b540600c4","ae40fefe872c034cdd20284d67f5a87c0fded776","39a70ba075d3fa765453dee8a5dbf863e78ba8fa","76dba952e670031457e565be6e36e426682c5972","5dc6783daf6fe1ab34d47ec7ea4a3ada5d1c487c","5848d57a97ee99648edaa169c6d74740448cc973","c325038eaa582937f1792496fce41f9266f4bf95","296430642f012f2d742fd184ee76c5f7347dd616","a19c1a1220dc3e16a4d0272986919e69d619c76e","42f45dbc7f2898abb096e2f350a1f531adb43cd7","dfe37459bd357db5115652d462e2cdb03b57a403","b0dbf55ffde55bce9299c455e17c62dfce113cee","0bc382bafc2830e64af4fe86e93f663d9b6c2887","c054059ef2a301aa8f34447ecc08bbd71464984d","25a68042d517b14f8b88b01acb7ae29cfbe093a2","d9db1e38609c00725032d818855cdb60dc6f9911"],"title":"Survival Models in Health Economic Evaluations: Balancing Fit and Parsimony to Improve Prediction","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1269"}

It is assumed that a normal random variable (L) underlies the artificially dichotomized variable. The proposed correlation coefficient recovers the product moment correlation coefficient between X and L from a fourfold table of X and Y. The suggested correlation coefficient nu is contrasted with the phi correlation and the biserial eta. The biserial eta was proposed by Karl Pearson and is conceptually related to the new correlation coefficient. However, in addition, Pearson's biserial eta invokes the assumption that the marginal distribution of L is normal, which contradicts its basic assumptions and thus does not recover the true correlation of L and X. Finally, an approximation is provided to simplify the calculation of nu and its standard error.","inCitations":["41fa331d76d946086af4256cfbe446dcc63214e6","51abfd8aa7a57cfed6db807b871eb3d90c673fcc","409dcd2fd589166b36e61d1a64f812542bbb779a","3c649a8a4a4a92090cdb3af314f9fa4282fcc1f2","9b1c50351f6ea233e56baf13aaae4d084e98f16d","1d951c8c87e41d4e0821cb075d7f8cab237bc6c3","5bd46dd2f9f3f7068a2c0f454cfb8c714acdab57","f3bf21d61ae1b00617ca501f41ae812632d077bb","72232addf3615cd212767c98711846c480c666cf"],"title":"On the correlation of a naturally and an artificially dichotomized variable.","doi":"10.1348/0007110042307203"}

Such genomic covariates often have certain structures and can be represented as vertices of an undirected graph. Biological processes also vary as functions depending upon some biological state, such as time. High-dimensional variable selection where covariates are graph-structured and underlying model is nonparametric presents an important but largely unaddressed statistical challenge. Motivated by the problem of regression-based motif discovery, we consider the problem of variable selection for high-dimensional nonparametric varying-coefficient models and introduce a sparse structured shrinkage (SSS) estimator based on basis function expansions and a novel smoothed penalty function. We present an efficient algorithm for computing the SSS estimator. Results on model selection consistency and estimation bounds are derived. Moreover, finite-sample performances are studied via simulations, and the effects of high-dimensionality and structural information of the covariates are especially highlighted. We apply our method to motif finding problem using a yeast cell-cycle gene expression dataset and word counts in genes' promoter sequences. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can result in better variable selection and prediction for high-dimensional regression when the underlying model is nonparametric and covariates are structured.

As a result, the treatment labels among the units are possibly dependent, complicating estimation and posing challenges for statistical inference. For example, cluster randomized trials frequently sample communities from some target population, construct matched pairs of communities from those included in the sample based on some metric of similarity in baseline community characteristics, and then randomly allocate a treatment and a control intervention within each matched pair. In this case, the observed data can neither be represented as the realization of n independent random variables, nor, contrary to current practice, as the realization of n/2 independent random variables (treating the matched pair as the independent sampling unit). In this paper we study estimation of the average causal effect of a treatment under experimental designs in which treatment allocation potentially depends on the pre-intervention covariates of all units included in the sample. We define efficient targeted minimum loss based estimators for this general design, present a theorem that establishes the desired asymptotic normality of these estimators and allows for asymptotically valid statistical inference, and discuss implementation of these estimators. We further investigate the relative asymptotic efficiency of this design compared with a design in which unit-specific treatment assignment depends only on the units' covariates. Our findings have practical implications for the optimal design and analysis of pair matched cluster randomized trials, as well as for observational studies in which treatment decisions may depend on characteristics of the entire sample.","inCitations":["209928f2019676a868b7f0becd4da023e77a086c","a4d1443a5b0bc8ccbd2c1db9de0e799201570306","3f00a704a295a8165a502c8a99839b5ed18b401d","4150135622a51559c53e6e34c32ccbfa6571fe70","9263f291f0e50212fb62aeb43a4d59088f188a12","75f09fefce77947dd72916a634c6dca6174d4233","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c","bec23409277fd91121fa16bcf78c3cbe7dfdac07","a8d3afd007b1524dc468dbad5154c1a00cdb197f"],"title":"Adaptive Matching in Randomized Trials and Observational Studies.","doi":""}

Recently, several parametric/regression models have been developed utilizing the gene network information to select genes or pathways strongly associated with a clinical/biological outcome. Alternatively, in this paper, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model for gene selection incorporating network information. In addition to identifying genes that have a strong association with a clinical outcome, our model can select genes with particular expressional behavior, in which case the regression models are not directly applicable. We show that our proposed model is equivalent to an infinity mixture model for which we develop a posterior computation algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We also propose two fast computing algorithms that approximate the posterior simulation with good accuracy but relatively low computational cost. We illustrate our methods on simulation studies and the analysis of Spellman yeast cell cycle microarray data.","inCitations":["a3294cabbeab185f75885af73f1b2485cf80ee6b","e76c8af283621d5d3454e036fb0d1738a9d7570c","4c7ee54e991ced1de67a63c1df632c15f2fcfaed","b22b90a93783e7baa4e72d100ad9a228d3a72dd7","5e531ca606778866a8dea4fdbd6517b4ec401073","d387a291580122e1ee490a3888a10820de21d943","3d2c1e85198ce031ce707afdec8b1337ed9fca02","b984d8e78029828ee28272319f5aec2e488829f1","48dd02f684de882e0cabd611d72f0c0190f8789b"],"title":"A Bayesian Nonparametric Mixture Model for Selecting Genes and Gene Subnetworks.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS719"}

For example, a steeper dose-response curve than expected was reported in one such study. This article demonstrates that the maximum likelihood estimator systematically and considerably exaggerates the regression parameter with moderately large sample sizes. Thus a probable explanation for finding a steeper curve than expected is the method used to analyze the experiment, that is, the bias in the maximum likelihood estimator. An additional consequence of this bias is that the mean/median/ED50 are estimated with a misleading precision. In particular, confidence intervals are much too narrow. As a conclusion, we warn against conventional logistic or probit regression in combination with up-and-down designs.","inCitations":["0f8ec84f223072ef55835682f0a20b28227fc1af","f521a0c09122803d5eadec856de4ea953a196e6f","671df6388fa6451c97d03bc25f3a8a6749f6dc69","b80a23dffdacfba2806f66ee4f01bc02716b2a8e","f89bd03537e91eeb882e7d53751a2c8746e59f12","90eaa21b6f9e6dc1379e25fb070fe6fd76fe732b","a06bb7ca68ce2b9cc378dfdc39cf9c390afdda3c","8e667768f21ea2937c54fb2144c22e0706c0af69","bdab1eb71401efaf808c9dcfc8b5284821d2b0f5","c24fda6c7c2ab2f7a465a74dab8c9a606d507049","ddbe5e55230349eec4e4a68206a08f39fc1ab4cb","560a016b22b3cb2b275eaf8558ed12904689c8e8"],"title":"The distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator in up-and-down experiments for quantal dose-response data.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101190"}

This can lead to improved screening, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. Yet, most current multivariate methods to evaluate pleiotropy test the null hypothesis that none of the traits are associated with a variant; departures from the null could be driven by just one associated trait. A formal test of pleiotropy should assume a null hypothesis that one or fewer traits are associated with a genetic variant. We recently developed statistical methods to analyze pleiotropy for quantitative traits having a multivariate normal distribution. We now extend this approach to traits that can be modeled by generalized linear models, such as analysis of binary, ordinal, or quantitative traits, or a mixture of these types of traits. Based on methods from estimating equations, we developed a new test for pleiotropy. We then extended the testing framework to a sequential approach to test the null hypothesis that k+1 traits are associated, given that the null of k associated traits was rejected. This provides a testing framework to determine the number of traits associated with a genetic variant, as well as which traits, while accounting for correlations among the traits. By simulations, we illustrate the TypeâI error rate and power of our new methods, describe how they are influenced by sample size, the number of traits, and the trait correlations, and apply the new methods to a genomeâwide association study of multivariate traits measuring symptoms of major depression. Our new approach provides a quantitative assessment of pleiotropy, enhancing current analytic practice.","inCitations":["4d6a6bcb5cf1b0d0bb78ffee52fe569f11eab978"],"title":"Multivariate generalized linear model for genetic pleiotropy","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx067"}

Individualized treatment regimes have the potential to dramatically improve clinical outcomes. When the primary outcome is censored survival time, a main interest is to find optimal treatment regimes that maximize the survival probability of patients. Since the survival curve is a function of time, it is important to balance short-term and long-term benefit when assigning treatments. In this paper, we propose a doubly robust approach to estimate optimal treatment regimes that optimize a user specified function of the survival curve, including the restricted mean survival time and the median survival time. The empirical and asymptotic properties of the proposed method are investigated. The proposed method is applied to a data set from an ongoing HIV/AIDS clinical observational study conducted by the University of North Carolina (UNC) Center of AIDS Research (CFAR), and shows the proposed methods significantly improve the restricted mean time of the initial treatment duration. Finally, the proposed methods are extended to multi-stage studies.","inCitations":["2f0e4654e86c5bb96d2d4de8918768a74a44b3d9","ecf556b5125d37b584ad46a58a7a73adbd7ff514"],"title":"Doubly Robust Estimation of Optimal Treatment Regimes for Survival Data-with Application to an Hiv/aids Study.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1057"}
