Similarly, detecting case-control differences in co-expression among genes can be critical to understanding complex human diseases; however statistical methods have been limited by the high dimensional nature of this problem. In this paper, we construct a sparse-Leading-Eigenvalue-Driven (sLED) test for comparing two high-dimensional covariance matrices. By focusing on the spectrum of the differential matrix, sLED provides a novel perspective that accommodates what we assume to be common, namely sparse and weak signals in gene expression data, and it is closely related with Sparse Principal Component Analysis. We prove that sLED achieves full power asymptotically under mild assumptions, and simulation studies verify that it outperforms other existing procedures under many biologically plausible scenarios. Applying sLED to the largest gene-expression dataset obtained from post-mortem brain tissue from Schizophrenia patients and controls, we provide a novel list of genes implicated in Schizophrenia and reveal intriguing patterns in gene co-expression change for Schizophrenia subjects. We also illustrate that sLED can be generalized to compare other gene-gene \"relationship\" matrices that are of practical interest, such as the weighted adjacency matrices.","inCitations":["a635d5184faadcaaaf9deacc3cde023a11bdb8bc","e67bccacc04a883170bfe9e038e7938445d1d084","20df179ac839b14f112c2337240bed675bb1b6f3","e8c00d811834c9c4105096edc9749d3738b52363","f89aa517a1782396491bc2b01534f96f06777426","38892116652ebb6daf53f6b5f73d7a672f881ec6","bcbf0061d90068175652480d9c2341c169e95bf5"],"title":"Testing High-dimensional Covariance Matrices, with Application to Detecting Schizophrenia Risk Genes.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1062"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2013,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The need to use rigorous, transparent, clearly interpretable, and scientifically justified methodology for preventing and dealing with missing data in clinical trials has been a focus of much attention from regulators, practitioners, and academicians over the past years. New guidelines and recommendations emphasize the importance of minimizing the amount of missing data and carefully selecting primary analysis methods on the basis of assumptions regarding the missingness mechanism suitable for the study at hand, as well as the need to stress-test the results of the primary analysis under different sets of assumptions through a range of sensitivity analyses. Some methods that could be effectively used for dealing with missing data have not yet gained widespread usage, partly because of their underlying complexity and partly because of lack of relatively easy approaches to their implementation. In this paper, we explore several strategies for missing data on the basis of pattern mixture models that embody clear and realistic clinical assumptions. Pattern mixture models provide a statistically reasonable yet transparent framework for translating clinical assumptions into statistical analyses. Implementation details for some specific strategies are provided in an Appendix (available online as Supporting Information), whereas the general principles of the approach discussed in this paper can be used to implement various other analyses with different sets of assumptions regarding missing data.","inCitations":["2e7b6bfaf5dae982b0a64f705a48ddbaf415037f","c80e845ff75c3e9ea81730de93d06130d2e4f958","53b8f690a85d334e5038a2b00af1ca33aceb5c88","de707f596cee2000ded57fb06af2c35f9105563c","ada7780e621e9b1d515422a2c6f61be2d02a4de2","b137a86bee0ba271089ee6b8a56a584d36ae4fb0","7b278b954288e3780d2926d6e7729efd9c86c9b4","992425b84197cbf7cac3015abdb273ca7d41e91b","0c5bfc9749663dbe388197c2fafcb2bbf24d52b1","c190302249cdf86e92b7c9324ef3e93283ef744b","2be90e21fb283e59f20e22be7ee326611bbb2960","24684221496e4c588b8f795eda98507a8dca9ea8","278128fbb2954b0c200c1cf8d07bfaf5b44230de","64ee5037ded95576d844a64e16b793c10c291f8e","245f2437e4dc47a09046330dcb7393e5297c477b","b47933a8b5b92a4c17b615792bb1ba6dd0c945be","217b9b03ece50ce89c2d862888ca3716841f1ea8","a2a152c48f3a34108fa63e38f9354de2460a1015","18d6c94687e31157839fb5b9056ce917418c3ea2","a261bb42750c756fb1bd009673a2e3fefb3955c5","8a52c9a6895138318272f6dd211a4bdcf91e0797","ed1f3e8be5b33b359aa779cae4f3f6af82033225","914b6435a680316a8bb7907cb11daaf3da552a56","faed42ee98cc4c3d62904e81ce21eec4e1ad2b18","2bd3cc13eb315a17ed879e04ec53c03cd1069378","734620a286031d5941348a02dcb52725cb82bc27","13af64544678013e0d897d90be430776e5ef2e91","2d61221e75aaa1478e2530dc096ece823b5a3507","f315838ab5d71c02e3a41d2cd9c81af529e46acc","392d1204855c9f68e98db94b99b0e8a5662b46bd","1cb75652bb6486c89a5c6bd01a886c9c1f6f1471","7905a24a6714fca40a8cc887caf6c6b91b9d4758","38b9ebc358221d44193f739b423bbbd3932bbe4a","9580c128d799f8b0bf8beac975cca291100f7209","0041d9bf36ff681c0d369fddb6f8847b428ee326","be8b531e71147b72426f721fad2e5d104e2512af","3cbed7c9bb90ec6c2d9512795962a8899e2737a1","9454ee526c4285147165180c6a7f4a13a92728ed","6c16dc05c6e51cb9c56f358e9b5a6d47468a0318","95c2eff4bc13dbd4f598e2696aec5c9d7b6e711d","5962cedd44bbcef6b749e111e8f5bb3834afe6ac","ffac056ad77c4292f5b167465066e82894f804df","282fb23d5bb7ba9000ab9a3ba4a70072daa67846","ff9f9f38be8be98f24d0978d37d239f58bf35dfa","432efac0d6145b282f6be61d7c7fc208708e42c3"],"title":"Missing data in clinical trials: from clinical assumptions to statistical analysis using pattern mixture models.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1549"}

Previous efforts extended the framework by using item response theory (IRT) based trait scores, and by employing an iterative process using group-specific item parameters to account for DIF in the trait scores, analogous to purification approaches used in other DIF detection frameworks. The current investigation advances the technique by developing a computational platform integrating both statistical and IRT procedures into a single program. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation approach was incorporated to derive empirical criteria for various DIF statistics and effect size measures. For purposes of illustration, the procedure was applied to data from a questionnaire of anxiety symptoms for detecting DIF associated with age from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":1997,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Reference ranges are used in preclinical drug safety studies to screen experimental data for atypical values. The methods used most often to construct sample reference ranges are essentially large sample methods and may flag too few \"atypical\" values. It is better to generate finite sample reference ranges by modifying existing methods used for constructing tolerance intervals.

The methods are based on a conditional negative binomial model for the response given the baseline count and can be used to examine the effect of introducing selection criteria on power and sample size requirements.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2006,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"There are essentially two kinds of non-inferiority hypotheses in an active control trial: fixed margin and ratio hypotheses. In a fixed margin hypothesis, the margin is a prespecified constant and the hypothesis is defined in terms of a single parameter that represents the effect of the active treatment relative to the control. The statistical inference for a fixed margin hypothesis is straightforward. The outstanding issue for a fixed margin non-inferiority hypothesis is how to select the margin, a task that may not be as simple as it appears. The selection of a fixed non-inferiority margin has been discussed in a few articles (Chi et al., 2003; Hung et al., 2003; Ng, 1993). In a ratio hypothesis, the control effect is also considered as an unknown parameter, and the noninferiority hypothesis is then formulated as a ratio in terms of these two parameters, the treatment effect and the control effect. This type of non-inferiority hypothesis has also been called the fraction retention hypothesis because the ratio hypothesis can be interpreted as a retention of certain fraction of the control effect. Rothmann et al. (2003) formulated a ratio non-inferiority hypothesis in terms of log hazards in the time-to-event setting. To circumvent the complexity of having to deal with a ratio test statistic, the ratio hypothesis was linearized to an equivalent hypothesis under the assumption that the control effect is positive. An associated test statistic for this linearized hypothesis was developed. However, there are three important issues that are not addressed by this method. First, the retention fraction being defined in terms of log hazard is difficult to interpret. Second, in order to linearize the ratio hypothesis, Rothmann's method has to assume that the true control effect is positive. Third, the test statistic is not powerful and thus requires a huge sample size, which renders the method impractical. In this paper, a ratio hypothesis is defined directly in terms of the hazard. A natural ratio test statistic can be defined and is shown to have the desired asymptotic normality. The demand on sample size is much reduced. In most commonly encountered situations, the sample size required is less than half of those needed by either the fixed margin approach or Rothmann's method.","inCitations":["84a1cd1f1b0c7ef22eb6d87abfe27ee58afc8f4a","51d5b862e68b31a24cdfdfa3cd43d6a941040ba3"],"title":"A ratio test in active control non-inferiority trials with a time-to-event endpoint.","doi":"10.1080/10543400500508754"}

Two main challenges in imaging classification are the high dimensionality of the feature space and the complex spatial structure of imaging data. In SWPCA, we introduce two sets of novel weights including global and local spatial weights, which enable a selective treatment of individual features and incorporation of the spatial structure of imaging data and class label information. We develop an e cient two-stage iterative SWPCA algorithm and its penalized version along with the associated weight determination. We use both simulation studies and real data analysis to evaluate the finite-sample performance of our SWPCA. The results show that SWPCA outperforms several competing principal component analysis (PCA) methods, such as supervised PCA (SPCA), and other competing methods, such as sparse discriminant analysis (SDA).","inCitations":["3ef1aa70d22148011d5fd8d05a64babd9f61c895","8cbed22f52fa21a3ed5a719a6a5cec5365786fa9","ead6ecf08c837dbf62ccc8537beaa6d0856448f8","1365652eaedf93e93990a7c188f64e41ce82841b","a2d87195f05004ad1a8c2be63918ceb6a40ee23f","d7a8cb038d1d8c272e992fe529aab0287276ec5b","f8da29e8ebc0897b6318412fc6463da60d35b905","5b1b45dd9c55f0f37ca05c513b0ee72b55827007","2bccb3e85ce49104a85f2e7c6cf30999e260fc46"],"title":"Spatially Weighted Principal Component Analysis for Imaging Classification.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2014.912135"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2010,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The International Journal of Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"Most attempts at causal inference in observational studies are based on assumptions that treatment assignment is ignorable. Such assumptions are usually made casually, largely because they justify the use of available statistical methods and not because they are truly believed. It will often be the case that it is plausible that conditional independence holds at least approximately for a subset but not all of the experience giving rise to one's data. Such selective ignorability assumptions may be used to derive valid causal inferences in conjunction with structural nested models. In this paper, we outline selective ignorability assumptions mathematically and sketch how they may be used along with otherwise standard G-estimation or likelihood-based methods to obtain inference on structural nested models.

For continuous data, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) is a popular index for assessing agreement between multiple methods on the same subject where none of the methods is treated as reference. Barnhart et al. (2007) proposed coefficient of individual agreement (CIA) to assess individual agreement between multiple methods for situations with and without a reference method extending the concept of individual bioe-quivalence from the FDA 2001 guidelines. In this paper, we propose a new CCC for assessing agreement between multiple methods where one of the methods is treated as reference. We compare the properties of the CCC and CIA and their dependency on the relative magnitude of between-subject variability and within-subject variability. The relationship between CCC and CIA as well as the impact of between-subject variability are presented algebraically and graphically. Several examples are presented to explain the interpretation of the CCC and CIA values.","inCitations":["9ef5e21972dbf694b809aafcad58453771e3a602","00a4684e15aca717992c5f665afa52b07533cd63","2e905f426c150be642fc35495939be473b6976d9","7da7492ac77a4c731ea3d2fa7c6bc52312609793","313dd66aad0d3b6bd433729d84eab03ea031ea50","bc8a9a729a48dfe914390ccd384ee850d0f5e283","6e5c130842746de9287e551d2fb03d0d8bd69a50","b83524bb7477fdfe084f990f8bbc2e2aea20d527","53314e2edf158ac66ae76fe3b92e5ce6a039ea3b","112fc3f9dee58254d2bc6943a246a256e4004feb","0c8a5815279ec1c369e4c0a90d0aac7996a59d13","723a7696f89c20599f24dab2774d36b42f26d067","254ae6c37a9456b7cc0477bf6ac957e671ae3cd4","873ce989c9d130b1892a03cc22556051f4f82894","9f21f898e4148403aa2cf739e07d51c79fabf6c7","77047c541caf17fb60c5d7a2eedb3d167dc956c8","147059cfc041748643a4105fdabf51ba9ba4a97e","2ae9be8c1354b0737aea529d00de6abf3a5b6c7d"],"title":"Comparison of concordance correlation coefficient and coefficient of individual agreement in assessing agreement.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701329497"}

It is highly relevant for understanding human reproduction and represents a series of highly interrelated and timed processes. The statistical literature has recognized the need to incorporate both biological and behavioral factors (Barrett and Marshall, 1969; Dunson and Stanford, 2005) when modeling conception probabilities, given that intercourse during the fertile window is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for conception. The heterogeneity of behaviors such as the timing and frequency of intercourse in a menstrual cycle needs to be considered when estimating conception. Here we propose a joint model of intercourse behavior and human fecundability through a classic conception probability model and a structural equation model (SEM) to accommodate intercourse during the menstrual cycle. The SEM part of the proposed model allows the dependency between intercourse behaviors on consecutive days in a menstrual cycle to vary across days.

To account for the effects of measurement error, we apply a correction to a criterion function. The specific form of the correction proposed allows Monte Carlo simulations in problems for which the direct calculation of a corrected criterion is difficult. Therefore, in contrast to methods that require solving integral equations of possibly multiple dimensions, as in the case of multiple error-prone covariates, we propose methodology which offers a simple implementation. The resulting methods are functional, they make no assumptions about the distribution of the mismeasured covariates. We utilize profile kernel and backfitting estimation methods and derive the asymptotic distribution of the resulting estimators. Through numerical studies we demonstrate the applicability of proposed methods to Poisson, logistic and multivariate Gaussian partially linear models. We show that the performance of our methods is similar to a computationally demanding alternative. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our methods when applied to Nevada Test Site (NTS) Thyroid Disease Study data.","inCitations":["b4401500110b43b28c955e7829ecab93d6381a7c"],"title":"Estimation via corrected scores in general semiparametric regression models with error-prone covariates.","doi":"10.1214/11-EJS647"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2003,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In certain studies it is desirable or necessary that a subject, such as a patient in a medical trial, receive a treatment in each period. This facilitates a within-subject comparison of the treatments. Designs for studies of this type are called crossover designs or repeated measurements designs. If there are s subjects in p periods, the design should specify which of the t treatments is assigned to subject j in period i, i = 1,... ,p,j = 1,..., s. Equivalently we may think of a design as assigning each subject to one of the t(p) possible treatment sequences. The choice of a design will clearly depend on the values of p, s, and t, to which we will refer as the design parameters. But for any set of design parameters, we will typically still have many design choices. To distinguish between different designs for the same design parameters, we will compare the designs under criteria that are related to the objective of the study. Often the objective is a comparison of the treatments, and we would choose a design that, in some sense, provides good estimates of the treatment differences. For these criteria, a design that is optimal under one statistical model may not be optimal under another. It is therefore also of interest to identify designs that are efficient (relative to an optimal design) for more than one model. The main difference in the models that we will consider is in how the possible first-order carryover effects are modeled. This is a controversial issue, and it is by no means our intent to resolve this here. But a design that is efficient under a variety of plausible models is preferable to one that performs well under one model but poorly under another. Our main focus will be on two models. One of these models has been considered extensively in the literature, while the other is relatively new. For selected design parameters, we will compare selected designs under these models.","inCitations":["398df48eb863daa4c21d9ec910b32b22ad610292","6fe38f1c725057f5b5cde69113b6e2f62da0498a","7996d23360d09ca4bf429e8d8d98f7419958e73b","a50b1ed16c8b4b3ca1dfdd44f98029b143053a69","c216032ac7948a23c4f72d1a8ca5ecf7d2d77f71","41c0825a8d3dadbeae96baa36674dae09c950536","4327902fadefea2a00dc409f66317c4f2305f919","4653b798d7666be539fab41c0a21f7e6aa807b08","ba631407628ad94f5e5a872d838fe65fa74d3fdb","9879ddadaa3296c7398a984cafad49459e6de65a","6eb4b354367520083636e0cea281d14ed69ea853","47419ad46acfd7a0fbe370e8eb4a13742f871cef","51a817e31f4b91246e88d1b5d3e6b8476b21b98e","809c426242de81f5b7590bd69fbdcf668999a75a","1d584401472c500bf44aeb10b11a9819783b66e6","4280fae56be7fcc23efccdb479548dc9f128714f","43c7b860f67f2731fda95b93fc3d22711de87d32","45c260e58e8aa04ae37cf6cd9deb85dcf4e5e754","ca9c1d22d0f1d3181a5ef11241251fca4184e413","7c4dd4f12363128c94c5c9021495d6e847537920"],"title":"Optimal and efficient crossover designs under different assumptions about the carryover effects.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120022771"}

Pursuing the former approach, reasons are given for preferring the family of rp ‘coefficients of likeness’ to Mahalanobis' D or other distance measures. A general formula is presented for rp, applicable to factors of any obliqueness and any assigned weight, permitting classification by what an individual docs as well as by what he is. \n \n \n \nClassification procedures require recognition of the differences between types as homostats and as segregates. A homostat is a set of unusually similar people: a segregate is a series with above average similarities which thus has continuity, although there may be negligible resemblance between first and last members. A Boolean algorithm will objectively find homostats and sort them into phenomenal and nuclear clusters, and a further algorithm will operate on these to locate segregates. These steps have been combined in a computer program called Taxonome, two examples of the application of which are given. Search for types is a topographical descriptive procedure in which finding the ‘texture’ of a whole domain is as important as the location of individual types. Type analysis contributes to non-linear prediction, to theories of type origin, and to higher order systematization and conceptualization.","inCitations":["3062a9d29b804eb77ab321c4839ad85ead559f56","849287862e01639378d2301fe5489378df4adf59","ec01ffe30436e1556f69847fb26a92028dbf471a","cb40b885b6ee632785e4341675c483d784d73e05","59f21f036c75801f255841d238553da4e34ae6ca","4e66081ce3a28200642e1ba43e9165bee440dd91","75ba0044bfff03eac4f6830a6b610d01c37390a7","d7c5d631ee41a28ee13dac017c9955505bff457b","fcdd32b153a94e201cd5973c8ea2991c6b274fe5","8dbe424b9255bc7efc947d25b4f06013abb5e5d4","b155344aa9ba120d2a6fd2c556bbc4ae9064d26c","2ad92a21a021c8efb4faf5d85f2f933f9ee346df","220f41982a402777be4ab096efc4a2db6d6e68d8","9fb86d405fc929add9533a6a5c511c6d77c3f04f"],"title":"Principles of behavioural taxonomy and the mathematical basis of the taxonome computer program.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1966.tb00370.x"}

A major challenge in their use is determining which clusters represent important underlying structure, as opposed to spurious sampling artifacts. This challenge is especially serious, and very few methods are available, when the data are very high in dimension. Statistical Significance of Clustering (SigClust) is a recently developed cluster evaluation tool for high dimensional low sample size data. An important component of the SigClust approach is the very definition of a single cluster as a subset of data sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The implementation of SigClust requires the estimation of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix for the null multivariate Gaussian distribution. We show that the original eigenvalue estimation can lead to a test that suffers from severe inflation of type-I error, in the important case where there are a few very large eigenvalues. This paper addresses this critical challenge using a novel likelihood based soft thresholding approach to estimate these eigenvalues, which leads to a much improved SigClust. Major improvements in SigClust performance are shown by both mathematical analysis, based on the new notion of Theoretical Cluster Index, and extensive simulation studies. Applications to some cancer genomic data further demonstrate the usefulness of these improvements.","inCitations":["cb501bf9c94a99c1369fdc9100439a1ba070f5f1","d6f4b57f26075ca2eb906896b493daa495ece516","27f28b56e9e479ffd0d79038d3d5368691f06e0b","44dfd0859b54d03b2279455b97b5ad1d798234fa","1b878343e93e4268ad95bd9274603e2258f0964b","2e7eb0a78844f42484c6b7a138333d44c9968aa9","159f42b03579769c40ede738831c7ad5e98369e1","96e01992a9bddfd723b607a882559b372b5cf111","2c3671eb9ce5e655de233813153d3852a790ce2c","b1466b830f88e5a20d784ff2e54b4c088154b993","d4279f913271d93ef17b620cef7f7f5237a63f35","76f62046fc6e8108d324cfb6823306c260fa89c6","09f51d2a120639f084306dfd92cb4701b47d150e","a93d461d9306148cc264beeaa0212e74d9b15e2f","22ac0e5ddb8b21f50d524074748d4a62a634c2f2","61d62a814e1111fa5a750d1cbf6b943680a43849","be4458b52c481285de58adb6679dcf8d5cb1e952","8d5bb9d07b28b376fcc76c59eb7f1eb7793af355","69fdbbc5bebfc9007bc36397d2543246f60674da","3e427858a34cc6fabc67efc5946c8256f09aafd7","ef4009800135068509723f267e687dfc1bc5b1e8"],"title":"Statistical Significance of Clustering using Soft Thresholding.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2014.948179"}

Sensitivity analysis using Bayesian modeling for missing data offers a systematic approach to assessing the sensitivity of the inferences made on the basis of observed data. This paper uses data from an 18-month study of veterans with schizophrenia to demonstrate this approach. Data were obtained from a randomized clinical trial involving 369 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia that compared long-acting injectable risperidone with a psychiatrist's choice of oral treatment. Bayesian analysis utilizing a pattern-mixture modeling approach was used to validate the reported results by detecting bias due to non-random patterns of missing data. The analysis was applied to several outcomes including standard measures of schizophrenia symptoms, quality of life, alcohol use, and global mental status. The original study results for several measures were confirmed against a wide range of patterns of non-random missingness. Robustness of the conclusions was assessed using sensitivity parameters. The missing data in the trial did not likely threaten the validity of previously reported results.","inCitations":["49f719918ed525048ee1984b1b056cf11e82ebb8"],"title":"The impact of missing data on the results of a schizophrenia study.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1651"}

For tests of reasonable length and for realistic sample size, full-information test statistics such as Pearson's X2 and the likelihood ratio statistic G2 suffer from sparseness in the underlying contingency table from which they are computed. Recently, limited-information fit statistics such as Maydeu-Olivares and Joe's (2006, Psychometrika, 71, 713) M2 have been found to be quite useful in testing the overall goodness of fit of item response theory models. In this study, we applied Maydeu-Olivares and Joe's (2006, Psychometrika, 71, 713) M2 statistic to diagnostic classification models. Through a series of simulation studies, we found that M2 is well calibrated across a wide range of diagnostic model structures and was sensitive to certain misspecifications of the item model (e.g., fitting disjunctive models to data generated according to a conjunctive model), errors in the Q-matrix (adding or omitting paths, omitting a latent variable), and violations of local item independence due to unmodelled testlet effects. On the other hand, M2 was largely insensitive to misspecifications in the distribution of higher-order latent dimensions and to the specification of an extraneous attribute. To complement the analyses of the overall model goodness of fit using M2 , we investigated the utility of the Chen and Thissen (1997, J. Educ. Behav. Stat., 22, 265) local dependence statistic XLD2 for characterizing sources of misfit, an important aspect of model appraisal often overlooked in favour of overall statements. The XLD2 statistic was found to be slightly conservative (with Type I error rates consistently below the nominal level) but still useful in pinpointing the sources of misfit. Patterns of local dependence arising due to specific model misspecifications are illustrated. Finally, we used the M2 and XLD2 statistics to evaluate a diagnostic model fit to data from the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study, drawing upon analyses previously conducted by Lee et al., (2011, IJT, 11, 144).","inCitations":["59a99b1b01210d96478e5e17307dd5360cb9a22d","e6138b2a6bc6b5dc383f406d8891cd2981a22657","45feae66c974e002f9ed9c9dc89c146d4497f2b1"],"title":"Limited-information goodness-of-fit testing of diagnostic classification item response models.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12074"}

Identifying the 'optimal' dose is the rate-limiting step since conventional methods, estimating the full posterior predictive distribution of some utility function under each of the possible doses, are very slow. We explore a simpler strategy based on importance sampling, whereby the posterior mean of the utility at each candidate dose is estimated by taking its average across an empirical distribution for the model parameters from the current Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run, weighted according to the likelihood of one or more predicted observations. We identify appropriate settings for this algorithm and illustrate its application in the context of a normal dynamic linear model used in a dose-finding clinical trial of a neutrophil inhibitory factor in acute ischaemic stroke.","inCitations":["927b7ee5b73c7287a2d0d6b8923af87c91b44ce3","efd5d9c07325d977ca4c02fb0eb49f729e4ebe43","78ad398c7c1d8e2915eed5feb591098e37a76036","12db70111c6d61c5b824e17f597439db65541f6b","bae8a43aa2ae8b0797b47fbdb0ce95ebd1118600","6ac664fc29d8776ff4c8c81912c4f6774448bd90","f4aef353d5772fd5523b517d3da03727400bab4a","6fbbd94f127b6a316afa2e43442dce64b02f9448","7258d99d092fc46d0aa34e7bf724c1d9a137a2e2","88591cfc978c7116e82f677c5090f53560319e97","567ed60772d3751fa2392cf7c286a3e4319771bd"],"title":"Flexible design and efficient implementation of adaptive dose-finding studies.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701643947"}

The criterion for assessment of bioequivalence adopted by the FDA is a moment-based criterion evaluating log-transformed pharmacokinetic responses such as area under the blood or plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) or maximum concentration (Cmax). Unlike traditional small molecule drug products, the characteristics and development of biologic products are more complicated and sensitive to many factors. Thus, it is of concern to know whether the current bioequivalence criterion is applicable to the assessment of biosimilarity between biologic products. In this article, we compare the moment-based criterion with a probability-based criterion proposed by Tse et al. (2006) for assessment of bioequivalence or biosimilarity between two drug products in terms of consistency/inconsistency for correctly concluding bioequivalence or biosimilarity. A simulation study was conducted to study relative performance of the two criteria. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed criteria for assessment of biosimilarity of follow-on biologics are discussed.","inCitations":["812a477385d204e9d390271e3d60e71513bc0b4b","72a0da7b962a9968c127665a192b3c75e370ce2d","4f71472d7eb02af4133f7a1ddd7aa3b838f121dc","accaf379dba883356243a3a0596b0ffa97a702ab","c5fc43e388eefafcad61c9393ed5ba3b46cc6d18","c76ac5ab5842524950a302dccfeaee684f34513f","49d8715215aecfbb6e1d28e46b70e4723a543956","74c9bf0d33555eaf7f98c0e971d72fbe43148735","0f18a93d68ce1ce67fe50f0c7d628a7c60b6dfe9","572bdc1f8754278a9dd16cbe559054d106392f70","a411ff746d65512eb72b95c7d8f55a8156c05403","4b3ce815af84a6d1866213190167bba85d7ceba7","8854360b769b2473fa16d4c2674a646f8dfbfb4d","ca492dd883c9afb6abd401fbb6523c28b8c2852c","70ac9d005449cd82cc75c4631d6e7f4efdfa8bd8","8396ee74f1b063e3a6b12016128536e9dfc1bfee","31a2ac97446a3a5aba70ddba116c4124451ee723","6745cf652218043d711c695dedb2c487e2a68054","3d972b954ce38204aa1b6d496f1cf626fcc23502"],"title":"A comparison of moment-based and probability-based criteria for assessment of follow-on biologics.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903280308"}

We proceed by reporting a weighted average of the responses of clusters of earlier patients. The weights should be determined by the similarity of the new patient's covariate with the covariates of patients in each cluster. We achieve the desired inference by defining a random partition model that includes a regression on covariates. Patients with similar covariates are a priori more likely to be clustered together. Posterior predictive inference in this model formalizes the desired prediction.We build on product partition models (PPM). We define an extension of the PPM to include a regression on covariates by including in the cohesion function a new factor that increases the probability of experimental units with similar covariates to be included in the same cluster. We discuss implementations suitable for any combination of continuous, categorical, count, and ordinal covariates.An implementation of the proposed model as R-package is available for download.","inCitations":["28db5c883055aea6409a64b14c11614d056045d4","76de9f8fca83937a5a7e01231043c9b5b1d2e452","cfc1ae03a4eb87b54b1db8881a5827d8c6ee950b","0952011dd79a1be03f49497e5d305a760c609b68","d45b54d2c5ab67282815b2355af1b982d387e70a","3482d984fd1c60416e40ba4409a42addbc74da7f","c35518c4b5296b2c660445bbc2c9eafa1f47dcfa","55b3412671d9630e8a7828d9bd2a1705aaadcbd1","17a728adc32f6b1f2f65aea810fe0355fd7c5b60","da5163d16f4cd7dfae4acdd890be00d928a08a7e","2d48c9647e315c77de0e95a5a34ba788bf9500d2","1dbac7a2a543fe9113ff64cd041965bd41f31bcc","a2c9f8579557c2a33062eb6d4de7846bcbb6ff8b","9f251df368f7b4f65b4c103cfb7bb827d8c36ebf","7f673d188c8cb322fc893d9ffbe92ed636541d63","a139fd5e7656ebe426da69331e787fe72c2e1668","24b053406e64320b15a3c8500e25bf8b6a597ebc","eca664bbca25ce1d18003c3b59b570b8134df781","3b8a4fe850d50fcc1b182f8c0c664c5861b9cbb7","febc204104962b40f14a554ff68f2445018a31de","f40727069d4cd6f088930c9456ea7924d3e314b4","4b7f19191cb5f08fdb6b534f62068058dadf4b17","028d1231011c6fd7a03cc24082b7de4d9f667915","3cae1b02b9dfb3307e7a205e3d9a513e7dadfc37","7f1d1f321d556634f1857e8565e09b533510c703","5aca0355d74eedbe08574be078ccd8f402f005e1","4068b52f778ce33f301ff349a06388678d4410b2","1f18f14f26c365a7cd14d0067870d664e1e7e9bf","7d7aa0b4fa493f184820c5b46201b19f93843d48","9be6cfb1a764061a27dd1018db4fffaee9b67204","28129778eb41f370a1ac563d9050a1b714202b22","9c91d022ea02b85bbb1a29f04ace679ddee39c6f","d5dc5836224e38055cf65cd877ee1291faa21431","78d58ff3069865a959fe8493ea792b155171f9eb","1a41270b9117640fdd7cdf132e73385223126e00","14fdf1bc2334de1fe1a2bd05dc02a74e0e762ef9","f99318dfabc7af4d401afe9f11e0a61b60cde467","e81fea928b659e05d32f64033b371732bd122d03","75205315d3cad5d179f2b3ae2068c015d4c8007d","47b12210ed1f479a3aaf79571bb51c0e9a082d54","1af15b10dee8977fe85ccfc6e9d5b935cf4f8d03","402e97b8eadaa5094814c4c81e721509f59dcfee","3ff7bcf27dadbe8a7e7c5cc616dc90643b52b5d4","3142418c2c58cdbb072615d9e021bb33f2c3c715","fa642ed2005c421c919d71aed156f20789078571","e8301dff0bfc1193bc3a290525c150a493b4cb43","f46432ca2e4302b808cd1176f138c51acae09afb","36acb1efa73a92172999c21f38de80e2d90712ac","3cc8e1b4a17ecae94ef15a3bc5f00d888f372b5f","0bbd161299877a1815c5935e35a2ac44a64d158e","c70632546cebd51c27d425cae504f557b97d9d8f"],"title":"A Product Partition Model With Regression on Covariates.","doi":"10.1198/jcgs.2011.09066"}
