This may lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect and loss of precision. The issue of missing data for inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation of marginal structural models (MSMs) has often been addressed, though little has been done to compare different missing data techniques in this relatively new method of analysis. We propose a method for systematically dealing with missingness in MSMs by treating missingness as a cause for censoring and weighting subjects by the inverse probability of missingness. We developed a series of simulations to systematically compare the effect of using case deletion, our inverse weighting approach, and multiple imputation in a MSM when there is missing information on an important confounder. We found that multiple imputation was slightly less biased and considerably less variable than the inverse probability approach. Thus, the lower variability achieved through multiple imputation makes it desirable in most practical cases where the missing data are strongly predicted by the available data. Inverse probability weighting is, however, a superior alternative to naive approaches such as complete-case analysis.","inCitations":["ca463c8c8e44c79c0dda1aae73f0e20374752eac","1aff9b2ed0bec70b9243828fca0fe590345544e5","d47b4aaec98dae0902c83a788476f55ebaed6bbb","1c15f5a1183aaa012e83b4a06044e21cf4ca40da","b70b5f7b8f026f6b1cee1fc3b582e9f12de64ccb","c900bdf548ed2e8bbd1c614b6735455204d25509","59529fc67f9442e04bb83889b101708a5bf2709e","c7d422f0e6f5ad7ca3a2bcfab9abb0d74642efe5","9dcea1dd53b276ef63f2947e4526f089e882ee19","db04675a2800334aa9dc3ca3d74e2009e0a2a8b2","8a1d4ad2489816700583d1490d9211e9ea6887c7","6456401ad7b46699bc2844eeb37ac0c4f9486b8b","5eb7fc04da69604373b4d58b6ee4dba4369bc0f0","5c5d5d9d5e486dd3d4c4fa0da705632904a5f690","b634bfa3f51c69ecadf627a316aded489d460067","0c34cf9226656a3bed8c27db8a4e7604dd2df18c","b05ffc2274d34b80086f10a168ad708057218151","133681f145eae139e9af90fd6c83eebfc2e56891","ee7e6fa6b03b7a6780df045a230b53acd164a537","e74dfe2152b19cdc5a27507b17336b2246aaaea1","bf5837d4ab2ceb8d4a8bda47918080103830c656","ee0276298667e8cea0adaca414ae239745e3fa39","0a478f518a22173b8c1a7ec0ae53ba3649ae2ea2","7d32b2980ba36239b9a5e419175671dcae4f0ea8","fc38c4bce796b540f87e6fd25008d449c3fc9cbc","bebd498c3cf5fe1c774bafff1ba72e94d2fcd63c"],"title":"Missing Confounding Data in Marginal Structural Models: A Comparison of Inverse Probability Weighting and Multiple Imputation","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1106"}

In this situation, the target population for the proof of efficacy is commonly selected in a data-dependent way, for example, based on the results of a pilot study or a planned interim analysis. The performance of the applied selection rule is crucial for the success of a clinical trial or even a drug development program. We consider the situation in which the selection of the patient population is based on a biomarker and where the diagnostic that evaluates the biomarker may be perfect, that is, with 100% sensitivity and specificity, or not. We develop methods that allow an evaluation of the operational characteristics of rules for selecting the target population, thus enabling the choice of an appropriate strategy. Especially, the proposed procedures can be used to calculate the sample size required to achieve a specified selection probability. Furthermore, we derive optimal selection rules by modeling the uncertainty about parameters by prior distributions. Throughout, there is a strong impact of sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker on the results. It is therefore essential to evaluate the rules for patient selection before applying them, thereby bearing in mind that the diagnostic that evaluates the applied biomarker may be imperfect.","inCitations":["8a9fc04e57379aad6860cf02a434b5d0b8508d59","6be61362217e586fef25eb6e40b68d4b8c73521e","2d978be4ab99b4924083de721f9e81ee71c212e2","2cde7d41615164d08d099dc0de1156f04fc1c13c","27cfcd8586e1b37c40b2c67091395fdac7f1dfcf","4bc65502becb9108ca3a0a1d5594efd51c206253","093e269022bf353dbd8ce7582dbc9eb832c10c72","2822cd4f41962615b1ae6e1a8480a3c4afe1b33f","691a2267134c4a540cf64ec833f45b696890559c","d1278b966024cfe4bcbee9600253888b81efb879"],"title":"Decision rules for subgroup selection based on a predictive biomarker.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.856018"}

In this context, urn models-where the probability to assign patients to treatments is interpreted as the proportion of balls of different colors available in a virtual urn-have been used as response-adaptive randomization rules. We propose the use of Randomly Reinforced Urn (RRU) models in a simulation study based on a published randomized clinical trial on the efficacy of home enteral nutrition in cancer patients after major gastrointestinal surgery. We compare results with the RRU design with those previously published with the non-adaptive approach. We also provide a code written with the R software to implement the RRU design in practice. In detail, we simulate 10,000 trials based on the RRU model in three set-ups of different total sample sizes. We report information on the number of patients allocated to the inferior treatment and on the empirical power of the t-test for the treatment coefficient in the ANOVA model. We carry out a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of different urn compositions. For each sample size, in approximately 75% of the simulation runs, the number of patients allocated to the inferior treatment by the RRU design is lower, as compared to the non-adaptive design. The empirical power of the t-test for the treatment effect is similar in the two designs.","inCitations":["6360e76b4927b9c8005e8cdbeab5297a5c196bf2","d4fb0b69d807397fc27ea5d94d67c5b780593f24"],"title":"Urn models for response-adaptive randomized designs: a simulation study based on a non-adaptive randomized trial.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2018.1452024"}

It was originally designed for binary problems with desirable theoretical properties. Although there exist various Multicategory SVM (MSVM) extensions in the literature, some challenges remain. In particular, most existing MSVMs make use of k classification functions for a k-class problem, and the corresponding optimization problems are typically handled by existing quadratic programming solvers. In this paper, we propose a new group of MSVMs, namely the Reinforced Angle-based MSVMs (RAMSVMs), using an angle-based prediction rule with k - 1 functions directly. We prove that RAMSVMs can enjoy Fisher consistency. Moreover, we show that the RAMSVM can be implemented using the very efficient coordinate descent algorithm on its dual problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is highly competitive in terms of computational speed, as well as classification prediction performance.

In its original formulation, the scheme is based on a fixed sample size. Many experimenters feel that, whenever possible, it may be advantageous to bring these trials to an early halt and thus reduce average sample size required to complete the study. To address this issue a stopping rule has been proposed (O'Quigley and Reiner, 1998) based on the idea that continuing the study would not lead to a change in recommendation with high probability. The rule, based on precise probabilistic calculation, is quite involved and not straightforward to implement. A much simpler rule can be constructed based on the idea of having settled at some level. In this work we investigate more deeply the essential ingredients behind these rules and consider more closely their operating characteristics.","inCitations":["d694dbe34338c060a9cc856c1201d9e0c05db8c8","b1640fcdac06250b67fc8d9db7eed9cfc76a8733","fa3c0f2598f8fbbb3c63d51b879d97c0bbe770be","c4e2821c58a52d91984b398f372379c1e6c56061","3061a3ead443825e77db0f509979ec949af590eb","18b1e1048967b301c18de3734acb99169f1195e5","97ba59b11b81c4b181700ca45c0b5041a0277362","5db722b8a43eeaf89fec2ff88dc5cd958d9c9407","59d987b5aed1b030c6a1ad53245cfb9051f87c49","07fe097f52b7ac945adc00d05af339108887f2b6","37e3bb568cd24e78c0031629c19a77bba57fc25f","2cf5202916a14aec7509e0542fde2de7bc3086f1","40c0a1dd50cd04367b425997545e48c75c0643ee","5fa0966f5e8ae60e555d6c78c699eaa11c845014","68d633c75e414146d8e61399c2c81ae98a2b75ec","3e10c60716d9a705d8fd2b12c31f3ba717b23d70","9d4e25ff3cd46ad3beb4cd7da4e2b964f26a71dd","b949c0852b83b9f8ffb1829a9e5ec9e52460ae3b","37a91ce799a5c6b5537700b186d3fdbcb4d9b5b5"],"title":"Continual reassessment designs with early termination.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.1.87"}

Solving the sequence of simple optimization problems guarantees convergence to a solution of the complicated original problem. Convergence is guaranteed by requiring that the approximating functions majorize the original function at the current solution. The leading examples of majorization are the EM algorithm and the SMACOF algorithm used in Multidimensional Scaling. The simplest possible majorizing subproblems are quadratic, because minimizing a quadratic is easy to do. In this paper quadratic majorizations for real-valued functions of a real variable are analyzed, and the concept of sharp majorization is introduced and studied. Applications to logit, probit, and robust loss functions are discussed.","inCitations":["97fee0a74f04107ab215ae0aab86c025882723ba","314bbea32843455dc94da885a207a8cbd5953b13","2316fc04ff0131ebce5aed025cf8167cd405d5e1","12b406050e31637a06269c1a6d9ce6166b4ca875","c93dc7eeeee984d548e0a7173b43ad4ad43b3840","e1014b94334f5470cf5b2ed34f42994d63c43924","306a769fa65641aedf3125e229a6b861506bc609","57818866546f1bee27f00783c8b62734738bcc77","15cb7ea24aa780efbb995c4365149acb3a42c42f","c96fc18daaf0a9c204ed582053344dbb709d0dd4","4547e9110e198ec6e284ece63f3b875ec1761554","6b6505bfc02b83996a4fe19daec66ef5251474ba","8a483662c800af077e20d41f356dc813b7d5c2dd","f690d4db1fe6b191194072dd1d21ee7c565388c5","8f458e739c2c771cdac6f5a29eaa8d9bf8128a3c","f2bc673d4dd7d0ab24a5431784cb2f736dcd4763","399bc94b5ec174faaa3cf1865327fc38fa4c061e","d77f4c3a9440b859b9ea1f6d3cdef67728164fdb","b7532a0de1b6012e82199105c2d789dc78332d6e","6fb54dd25546234b99c3b0a9d68c3a20ae98cce4","96ecdf3dd1a4b57702ba2ecd3b66538c485a4de6","58fffe271b1bda1db332c9655efce6db4ccb5246","cc3252c22406899b976d63bc394fcfa45fee6cde","8483609150b966ae787f0808066ab94a7b35618a","2cb062ed997ee05cb84a32063ef776a00d16d7f6","12dba59c0bd783c4b9c84d2c933f5b3acc9867c7","abd21a350e5915df418f6fffb5a3c4192719de33","4808f9f5540c9fb82cddd57085712252432cea8d","0b4f2b54834d18f15816075cd10dc29a6eb03dac","3a766c074341982725ad27009de3e9d7d26c86db","125d6358c0989823a8a2ba2115c7567c4a796296","b0da2ea428692e7cead6e0a7a351a2e5d040c2a0"],"title":"Sharp quadratic majorization in one dimension","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2009.01.002"}

Simulated conditions of control indicate that as alternatives become more available, so does potential reduction of the probability that aversive events will occur. The simulations indicate, further, that realizing this potential rests on predictive judgements surrounding the alternatives; such judgements represent ‘cognitive demands’ which are regarded as stressing in their own right. After being demonstrated quantitatively, the inverse relation between aversive-event probability and requisite predictive judgements is examined empirically. Mathematical models of preference and choice are then used to identify implications of the inverse relation for the relative ‘appeal’ held by alternate conditions of control. Both strengths and limitations of the current formulation and its supporting evidence are noted. Finally, the present type of control regarding stressing events is compared to other types, followed by discussion of their respective roles.","inCitations":["6938757950d7a198c07c8f43f9531e2e4b3aa70b","7ac97bac70a30f6657ced57f33bbd23308c7e204","b068d2271ead8d5fad79af50b8af3377ab524829","a99ab52728b176d7b5d7932fc64a9ac365fd6294","f686160002bff20f18550a3a4ed25909b9216a26","1d5cef076c6afbbf668b9bc776f7e935ffade629","390fdaf33aa82880bc279d08d1fa7f9f87336780","513ba89defcbe9669320e965de9c9363a33bfeec","3df62cd473fc023a071f5d45aea254367f6acd39","cdeb06bb0ea4cab487b2300969562b858a527319","130055b81fa26d9dbb60404a0dabb419f650a85e"],"title":"The economy of probabilistic stress: interplay of controlling activity and threat reduction.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1988.tb00894.x"}

Sequences of treatments are given to subjects, and in practice the observations within each subject are likely to be correlated. This paper is concerned with the construction of crossover designs for such cases. The design problem is nonlinear in the parameters, and design optimality depends on the parameters defining the correlation structure. When the correlation structure is known, local optimum designs are obtained. When the distribution of its parameters is known, optimum Bayesian crossover designs are constructed. The optimum sizes of the groups of subjects receiving the same sequence of treatments are also determined.","inCitations":["0a85e92e6464b58a8a17eb1f2956edf5e9702066","740651969d47c280909899e45d3a67b9c0a08d9a","285bc06f3d74cf8ca495b0bc3a1151e84212563a","8498939159cad3d6aeddb23c11f91753155a5b89","b47136184b570c6c4023ac66b8dc06eaf67834fd","d00597f1d16512fa625a279fe9e9924b513a4cbf"],"title":"Crossover designs with correlated observations.","doi":"10.1080/10543409808835237"}

The interested inference could be the mean change from baseline to a particular visit in some lab values, the proportion of responders to some threshold category at a particular visit post baseline, or the time to some important event. However, in some applications, the interest may be in estimating the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at a fixed time point post baseline. When the data are fully observed, the CDF can be estimated by the empirical CDF. When patients discontinue prematurely during the course of the study, the empirical CDF cannot be directly used. In this paper, we use multiple imputation as a way to estimate the CDF in longitudinal studies when data are missing at random. The validity of the method is assessed on the basis of the bias and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. The results suggest that multiple imputation yields less bias and less variability than the often used last observation carried forward method.","inCitations":["fb16e0fa7812a4a44604631250e0e6fb3c07e36b","8d63351ccc6d222cd3cd8da2ce6adb7b57262115","b4b327ac9c1d9a358a749c519d1cd545b56b4fb7"],"title":"Using multiple imputation to estimate cumulative distribution functions in longitudinal data analysis with data missing at random.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1579"}

Simulation results are conducted to validate the proposed methods.","inCitations":["256134720d4f1a0634b5591c78c123d025a1cb71"],"title":"Simultaneous inference for semiparametric mixed-effects joint models with skew distribution and covariate measurement error for longitudinal competing risks data analysis.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1293080"}

A challenge in mega‐analysis is estimating the distribution for clustered, potentially censored event times where the dependency structure can introduce bias if ignored. We propose a new proportional odds model with unknown, time‐varying coefficients, and random effects. The model directly captures event dependencies, handles censoring using pseudo‐values, and permits a simple estimation by transforming the model into an easily estimable additive logistic mixed effect model. Our method consistently estimates the distribution for clustered event times even under covariate‐dependent censoring. Applied to three observational studies of Huntington's disease, our method provides, for the first time in the literature, evidence of similar conclusions about motor and cognitive impairments in all studies despite different recruitment criteria.","inCitations":["f2d98292fca9881cc0ee5f57c570d7ce4c8e958c","5c30c3f4e7f864132038e4d1f1201ac354fd5b53"],"title":"Time‐varying proportional odds model for mega‐analysis of clustered event times","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx065"}

The technique involves polynomial splines that provide an approximation to the derivatives of the mean functions, the covariance functions and the associated eigenfunctions. We show that the proposed procedure has desirable statistical properties. In particular, we first show that the proposed estimators of derivatives of the mean curves are semiparametrically efficient. Second, we establish consistency results for derivatives of covariance functions and their eigenfunctions. Most importantly, we show that the proposed spline confidence bands are asymptotically efficient as if all random trajectories were observed with no error. Finally, the confidence band procedure is illustrated through numerical simulation studies and a real life example.","inCitations":["9b0fd3feb0658ea22a37ff49624ae6432d67378f","05986d09e564a7b39458b1c7268f196fdcb90479","00d7b83161fe6c3230b63f42262af5356c3eca59","2f569f40de656d7ac84b9527b2747c78da122dd7","3f0e7807cc8c5c0a8878e5b544301d6b63b86aad","5c915b60b6916cd0cfce27389630aeb6889e18cd","4fec526724484e587223426702b423d557b150b8"],"title":"Spline Confidence Bands for Functional Derivatives.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2012.01.009"}

Current application of the Youden index is limited to two diagnostic groups. However, there usually exists a transitional intermediate stage in many disease processes. Early recognition of this intermediate stage is vital to open an optimal window for therapeutic intervention. In this paper, we extend the Youden index to assess diagnostic accuracy when there are three ordinal diagnostic groups. Parametric and nonparametric methods are presented to estimate the optimal Youden index, the underlying optimal cut-points and the associated confidence intervals. Extensive simulation studies covering representative distributional assumptions are reported to compare performance of the proposed methods. A real example illustrates the usefulness of the Youden index in evaluating discriminating ability of diagnostic tests.","inCitations":["426b9682b318e2223d733eb84e8e24a07466bbc0","3cfd418648025093e943f478e7f8120fe822d8d2","1c7fe803c0879bf8ef79bb9097e3e1b20031ad5e","73e2b473d13d71e799c7a463162cb7cf814e2ed3","218f64b684eecf4f1046b48602cbb78d40dfda75","75e70da220d06be00ff6d1cf98efbaaaf42bdbd0","44abd6c74e07671f69a5210e46e8fdc981f2e236","ecb1d7645cfe0081aed8d763765811fc0cb49a78","f2cfbc8d98fa666c9779bd74b25373f6225d383f","5b94f01503320ec0708cafb0191cf923e663f551","3198699669995044254084c36ba5e503c0b16e50","a33c12551c00cdf5a1443d34a5b09558a388c533","2bddf3ca8e466259d6a387b51479c39ea0e51e6b","492635b89d364bf2aa8b30bb41b1766904f21fc3","db2288c6ef4fb8103f739743958e05cc16a455ca","9f7f5e727faea4b22556ba5dd0983b23a1fd8d01","2dc3321b0f9c8cc31014fd8375e83770d6309b36","9fddc6acf334d861f85316c4c31a07d533efa740","04e653021f92258e0692e6c37459f1c457022ce6","f29258e25611a468a89b903e575286b3eb0baa6a","c44572ee019b619fcd36f8ce033a4bd171d79835"],"title":"Youden Index and Associated Cut-Points for Three Ordinal Diagnostic Groups","doi":"10.1080/03610918.2012.661906"}
