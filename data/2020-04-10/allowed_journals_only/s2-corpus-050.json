It is closely related to several popular multivariate analysis methods such as canonical correlation analysis and principal component analysis. Like principal component analysis, CA solutions can be rotated orthogonally as well as obliquely into a simple structure without affecting the total amount of explained inertia. However, some specific aspects of CA prevent standard rotation procedures from being applied in a straightforward fashion. In particular, the role played by weights assigned to points and dimensions and the duality of CA solutions are unique to CA. For orthogonal simple structure rotation, procedures recently have been proposed. In this paper, we construct oblique rotation methods for CA that take into account these specific difficulties. We illustrate the benefits of our oblique rotation procedure by means of two illustrative examples.","inCitations":["979d318e36ac11c4116252a1ccfb878f60b9ea14","fd18749398e8cfd552a796063ce05f92a7646029","08a447457076cb60e197662b7337bda3d7f7cf36"],"title":"Oblique rotation in correspondence analysis: a step forward in the search for the simplest interpretation.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X368295"}

Specifically, we formulate a unified Bayesian joint model for the mixed longitudinal responses and time-to-event outcomes. For the longitudinal model of continuous and binary responses, we investigate multivariate generalized linear mixed models using shared random effects. Longitudinal and time-to-event data are assumed to be independent conditional on available covariates and shared parameters. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, implemented in OpenBUGS, is used for parameter estimation. To illustrate practical considerations in choosing a final model, we fit 37 different candidate models using all possible combinations of random effects and employ a Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) to select a best fitting model. We demonstrate the prediction of future event probabilities within a fixed time interval for patients utilizing baseline data, post-baseline longitudinal responses, and the time-to-event outcome. The performance of our joint model is also evaluated in simulation studies.","inCitations":["4fbe5e95693df02edfded4fbecbfe7ee06610366","698107c15065664bfd55132bbca1c3c61ca6670e","1cf74aaab3b63b7401eaab0c95df30c0f8b55f2d"],"title":"Prediction of transplant-free survival in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients using joint models for event times and mixed multivariate longitudinal data.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2014.909784"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"A common approach to analysing clinical trials with multiple outcomes is to control the probability for the trial as a whole of making at least one incorrect positive finding under any configuration of true and false null hypotheses. Popular approaches are to use Bonferroni corrections or structured approaches such as, for example, closed-test procedures. As is well known, such strategies, which control the family-wise error rate, typically reduce the type I error for some or all the tests of the various null hypotheses to below the nominal level. In consequence, there is generally a loss of power for individual tests. What is less well appreciated, perhaps, is that depending on approach and circumstances, the test-wise loss of power does not necessarily lead to a family wise loss of power. In fact, it may be possible to increase the overall power of a trial by carrying out tests on multiple outcomes without increasing the probability of making at least one type I error when all null hypotheses are true. We examine two types of problems to illustrate this. Unstructured testing problems arise typically (but not exclusively) when many outcomes are being measured. We consider the case of more than two hypotheses when a Bonferroni approach is being applied while for illustration we assume compound symmetry to hold for the correlation of all variables. Using the device of a latent variable it is easy to show that power is not reduced as the number of variables tested increases, provided that the common correlation coefficient is not too high (say less than 0.75). Afterwards, we will consider structured testing problems. Here, multiplicity problems arising from the comparison of more than two treatments, as opposed to more than one measurement, are typical. We conduct a numerical study and conclude again that power is not reduced as the number of tested variables increases.","inCitations":["0cae069e1224f51c8aa283d911dc39278f635160","919e97097939033b817b40f69a104fa9a40a9e26","cc4f43110917dd11a18133476131bec946ed5468","6bf53006ecaff490a423a09f0958ab43c975b3f4","5b7b9535bc674cb9a75d523bd89f1691dd24578a","fd3b413e23fa3aca511afeea010305ddcbfa06f2","8f56ea9249c1931bed480ffbf6a2e4f166dc7a58","a9538dc90a189bb590a3191b2064f7d5a47ee085","e625b62266db32015cc36edbc48b6760348c5eee","ed776ebaf56138d4909f2c57c744af0f54ab5dd7","0a6202b345d49f5e5e77a820e8fec573a8390390","7555d1a50262de69ab37a438d04cb6c393e47bed","6a7b3e26da4c117cfc28ad54ddd8d71bf300293a","07d8899d26bea39ce4f5e62972716eb5386c259b","351a51d7a64cea3b6e16db0c8fd863695784066d","2b7b0617303c9db7c87efaf801d32cec09a2ce72","090a699485f216815e3f8792ddf627b5f817f8e6","f70daa47bfe95d32ce46ed483ed7756623189e50","500653e6a559079a5aa52883f3532562be77b66d","f22120a0eccc18fe07710981ef6c7027d5f52211","1a502adc41b6a62040c2b0aa54eb8421751f4c1e","6e534e839c0ac41889253663ce58cca8e5e0bdf0","6efceaa062295c81617c4617bc7254995fc4b19b","780b29f931b7323929f52f50ae170f35dde53a9d","5ad745051464cb74dca903db257bc150ba95c099","8258bd15f8343bf1628a8ef6de7c9d5bf37cff91","333119b0d785ed40673909b5917f8a514f92b1d7","deb0941e1832025692e071a1077cde1315bf693f","b30e5d2965013de8996bcf7d747048e774b114da","47a77b3117ce6c253780d0f0faac71d1763f0158","0137fb09f57fd3685a6c3a43159c3647b6f1d667","cb0235e2d037de835ed2e8044493108802cd0a60","140a9875f67156ce77fb391166108d0dc2920013","b9128680fa4c13a8846cba816faac90a09464211","bae8a43aa2ae8b0797b47fbdb0ce95ebd1118600","c1fb5cbe9a010820e9ed79427ffae1198eee808f"],"title":"Power and sample size when multiple endpoints are considered.","doi":"10.1002/pst.301"}

Large-scale genomic profiling studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have generated vast amounts of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data. While these studies have provided great resources for researchers to discover clinically relevant tumor subtypes and driver molecular alterations, there are few computationally efficient methods and tools for integrative clustering analysis of these multi-type omics data. Therefore, the aim of this article is to develop a fully Bayesian latent variable method (called iClusterBayes) that can jointly model omics data of continuous and discrete data types for identification of tumor subtypes and relevant omics features. Specifically, the proposed method uses a few latent variables to capture the inherent structure of multiple omics data sets to achieve joint dimension reduction. As a result, the tumor samples can be clustered in the latent variable space and relevant omics features that drive the sample clustering are identified through Bayesian variable selection. This method significantly improve on the existing integrative clustering method iClusterPlus in terms of statistical inference and computational speed.

For example, leukemia-free patients surviving a bone marrow transplant are at risk of developing acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease, or they might develop infections. In this situation, competing risks models provide a natural framework to describe the disease. When incorporating covariates influencing the transition intensities, an obvious approach is to use Cox's proportional hazards model for each of the transitions separately. A practical problem then is how to deal with the abundance of regression parameters. Our objective is to describe the competing risks model in fewer parameters, both in order to avoid imprecise estimation in transitions with rare events and in order to facilitate interpretation of these estimates. Suppose that the regression parameters are gathered into a p x K matrix B, with p and K as the number of covariates and transitions, respectively. We propose the use of reduced rank models, where B is required to be of lower rank R, smaller than both p and K. One way to achieve this is to write B = AGamma(intercal) with A and Gamma matrices of dimensions p x R and K x R, respectively. We shall outline an algorithm to obtain estimates and their standard errors in a reduced rank proportional hazards model for competing risks and illustrate the approach on a competing risks model applied to 8966 leukemia patients from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.","inCitations":["1a1399aa951d4257687da16d2d963efab6f7927e","0bbabef525bb2cd997717ffc8859239f3b33b98f","8ae56b970412724a58dc07c1f14f61967b5644f3","4ca7dd808c18ad95bddac37e8e908e308f9926cd","bd0484b5efd83aee720fadb826b3467a46bcd090","bd6b17d746e7a5f2bbc09944db3013d98cb0288a","8d1bc4f9b4ed813ccea76e45508cc523bd9d8994","5cb3538df700c2f49449570f383a547b6908bbc4","b6769890f452812c0ff908698c90c6124bb3feb7","edf4c68928e011fdd32bc1c4b86b0305e337f190","c9af414a701b43a6ea22f104eadf36f4f3edabaa","be3686dc10947e373158ad9040405d85bf8b5048","d5d0d8a18003afaa60815f44f0b6bdef9ead19c0","c4f557cd5d9543f54ef1c9f157adf9db64b85e13","1a342afefe4f0506a8ee678f19bfac93cbd7fb87"],"title":"Reduced rank proportional hazards model for competing risks.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2004.10.031"}

A boosting algorithm is proposed that is able to handle the more general setting where DIF can be induced by several covariates at the same time. The covariates can be both continuous and (multi-)categorical, and interactions between covariates can also be considered. The method works for a general parametric model for DIF in Rasch models. Since the boosting algorithm selects variables automatically, it is able to detect the items which induce DIF. It is demonstrated that boosting competes well with traditional methods in the case of subgroups. The method is illustrated by an extensive simulation study and an application to real data.","inCitations":["17dbc631bdb4cfb7e4e823126e39a8dd97defc08","a3846e1a1ec8adc7d886770071b11a5f1e685cf6","b14623ee36097b99b04a2865dcf988085f38fea8","0c713b988573dd8f0808fbfadf84fd9fb7cf9ad9","f8d98e8449d5fde19824e7fe1ff2b685d631e499","715012bba02f8919eb08c71fbb7f50b683f7740d"],"title":"Detection of differential item functioning in Rasch models by boosting techniques.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12060"}

We employ selection priors that exploit the dependencies across adjacent copy number states and investigate MCMC stochastic search techniques for posterior inference. Our approach results in a unified modeling framework for simultaneously inferring copy number variants (CNV) and identifying their significant associations with mRNA transcripts abundance.

To partially explain the variations, time-dependent covariates are usually introduced to these models. Some covariates, however, may be often measured with substantial errors and missing observations. It is often the case that model random error is assumed to be distributed normally, but the normality assumption may not always give robust and reliable results, particularly if the data exhibit skewness. In the literature, there has been considerable interest in accommodating either skewed response or covariate measured with error and missing data in such models, but there has been relatively little study concerning all these features simultaneously. This article is to address simultaneous impact of skewness in response and measurement error and missing data in covariate by jointly modeling the response and covariate processes under a framework of Bayesian semiparametric nonlinear mixed-effects models. In particular, we aim at exploring how mixed-effects joint models based on one-compartment model with one phase time-varying decay rate and two-compartment model with two phase time-varying decay rates contribute to modeling results and inference. The method is illustrated by an AIDS data example to compare potential models with different distributional specifications and various scenarios. The findings from this study suggest that the one-compartment model with a skew-normal distribution may provide more reasonable results if the data exhibit skewness in response and/or have measurement error and missing observations in covariates.","inCitations":["3083d432efeaac9ee6a6b70ac82940a8f09468e5","199c70bb7954231a0f603980010d4c7e6d359d72","b2298f941b9bf257e7b0dccfa784fc0568483687","3cdf5be361c6a5d963b631e6ebb3c51b8bf87739","d04cbad5787c4775435dea7fd19abec6b3c0221e","c5fe92c9180986bea79569444a652dce04c7905a","31cdd59d189971d40e009279cc1ef366b489ffb2","872aa166e975bcb678db099ae71455b8723a94c4"],"title":"Mixed-Effects Joint Models with Skew-Normal Distribution for HIV Dynamic Response with Missing and Mismeasured Time-Varying Covariate","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1426"}

A proportional hazards model for the subdistribution of a competing risk. Journal of the American Statistical Association94, 496-509). This model is widely used for the analysis of continuous event times in clinical and epidemiological studies. However, it does not apply when event times are measured on a discrete time scale, which is a likely scenario when events occur between pairs of consecutive points in time (e.g., between two follow-up visits of an epidemiological study) and when the exact lengths of the continuous time spans are not known. To adapt the Fine and Gray approach to this situation, we propose a technique for modeling subdistribution hazards in discrete time. Our method, which results in consistent and asymptotically normal estimators of the model parameters, is based on a weighted ML estimation scheme for binary regression. We illustrate the modeling approach by an analysis of nosocomial pneumonia in patients treated in hospitals.","inCitations":["4dc16a02f0e80a06bed4e8cc8b744699ac4e5246","fe9ee684ba4fd180135eb394c542d6f2fa08ba37"],"title":"Subdistribution hazard models for competing risks in discrete time.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy069"}

Determining the number of samples required to train a predictor from survival data is important for designing such studies. Existing sample size methods for training studies use parametric models for the high-dimensional data and cannot handle a right-censored dependent variable. We present a new training sample size method that is non-parametric with respect to the high-dimensional vectors, and is developed for a right-censored response. The method can be applied to any prediction algorithm that satisfies a set of conditions. The sample size is chosen so that the expected performance of the predictor is within a user-defined tolerance of optimal. The central method is based on a pilot dataset. To quantify uncertainty, a method to construct a confidence interval for the tolerance is developed. Adequacy of the size of the pilot dataset is discussed. An alternative model-based version of our method for estimating the tolerance when no adequate pilot dataset is available is presented. The model-based method requires a covariance matrix be specified, but we show that the identity covariance matrix provides adequate sample size when the user specifies three key quantities. Application of the sample size method to two microarray datasets is discussed.","inCitations":["c2184a0e28816c8623c15569f7f7259935e06856","ff67836b02a1402aea9be8bcfa1b41f52903194e","637dcd85606abb2d6e3211c404c4c37e76d782cb","7452927c19290c34d3274473d6af4becf26a095d"],"title":"Sample size requirements for training high-dimensional risk predictors.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt022"}

However, complete case analysis will lead to biased and inefficient results when the data are missing at random. We have extended the partial correlation coefficient in the presence of missing data using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and compared it with a multiple imputation method and complete case analysis using simulation studies. The EM approach performed the best of all methods with multiple imputation performing almost as well.

Since repeated measurements are nested within subjects and subjects are nested within families, both the subject-level and measurement-level correlations must be taken into account in the statistical analysis to achieve more accurate estimation. In such studies, the primary interests include to test for quantitative trait locus (QTL) effect, and to estimate age-specific QTL effect and residual polygenic heritability function. We propose flexible semiparametric models along with their statistical estimation and hypothesis testing procedures for longitudinal genetic designs. We employ penalized splines to estimate nonparametric functions in the models. We find that misspecifying the baseline function or the genetic effect function in a parametric analysis may lead to substantially inflated or highly conservative type I error rate on testing and large mean squared error on estimation. We apply the proposed approaches to examine age-specific effects of genetic variants reported in a recent genome-wide association study of blood pressure collected in the Framingham Heart Study.","inCitations":["dbf4e122b153900a650b4c9c9380b79768f4fe63","6299623b150044447744996bbf1bf0aec855d1dc","515cb25c085a42dc6e7df43adc4c9070f1d0af4b","92b8e28d61d6a7e2b450c5f211733fe66da025df","4f3d2669ebaae4ee21444a39d71c0b4e87deff58","d4f22e4e1f21aabf395cc69bc8d0ec048b92e288","9af6680dcd1def451f5b7eef299686d10262b891"],"title":"Flexible semiparametric analysis of longitudinal genetic studies by reduced rank smoothing.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2011.01016.x"}

Since QT interval is correlated with heart rate (HR), assessment of drug-induced QT interval prolongation should be made at a standardized HR, resulting in the need to correct QT interval (QTc) for HR. This study investigates the statistical properties of QTc intervals using individual based correction (IBC), population based correction (PBC), or fixed correction (FC) methods under both the linear and log-linear regression models for the QT-RR relationship where RR is the time elapsing between two consecutive heart beats (inversely related to HR through RR = 60/HR). This study shows that QTc intervals using PBC and FC methods are conditionally biased. The QTc interval using the IBC method is conditionally unbiased under the linear regression model, but is conditionally biased under the log-linear regression model. It also shows that under both the linear and log-linear regression models, the conditional variances of the QTc intervals using the three correction methods satisfy the order FC < or = PBC < or = IBC. Suggestions for analyzing QT intervals based on these findings are discussed.","inCitations":["53aa6c545ae872d26d1007d8290256f0c8f7c14e","114c911eb669955376ee32f11dd74dcb9fbbeee8","5fc0a119f748e71f9487f042073a7886d9a2dcff","b3c0c9708014bc44835a0e4d3d4c52f950baa1a4","cb2f1f973e351af01cf9f90477281d6d479f0fdf","4467ef17978e9166493c917e0df280fc3864d49d","3f41be9a659ab04c3f634d41d77cea72cf7c4037","7bcfd89727df3d1e3c933124f381ae8197c0aa4b"],"title":"Bias and variance evaluation of QT interval correction methods.","doi":"10.1080/10543400801992988"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"year":2000,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the meta-analytic approach to estimating the effect of a new treatment on a true clinical outcome measure, T, from the effect of treatment on a surrogate response, S. The meta-analytic approach (see Daniels and Hughes (1997) 16, 1965-1982) uses data from a series of previous studies of interventions similar to the new treatment. The data are used to estimate relationships between summary measures of treatment effects on T and S that can be used to infer the magnitude of the effect of the new treatment on T from its effects on S. We extend the class of models to cover a broad range of applications in which the parameters define features of the marginal distribution of (T, S). We present a new bootstrap procedure to allow for the variability in estimating the distribution that governs the between-study variation. Ignoring this variability can lead to confidence intervals that are much too narrow. The meta-analytic approach relies on quite different data and assumptions than procedures that depend, for example, on the conditional independence, at the individual level, of treatment and T, given S (see Prentice (1989) 8, 431-440). Meta-analytic calculations in this paper can be used to determine whether a new study, based only on S, will yield estimates of the treatment effect on T that are precise enough to be useful. Compared to direct measurement on T, the meta-analytic approach has a number of limitations, including likely serious loss of precision and difficulties in defining the class of previous studies to be used to predict the effects on T for a new intervention.","inCitations":["231308aebaca9d5616cbdc54eba36abd7be02f7c","566dc41f3b3e43b021a3dde42bc6d8c97ceba32f","41f6b982811d9345812d597897392a0104db9227","564ea8cf766deaf936f2c9e88d79461677332cbd","711a2fc38173e3940f0cd6251d26380669b06168","7f16da23304e8fbfbadb0352580c714f8a781eb2","871d6fcf14a2e699d448cb9203f8affefab20012","f333899e7071bcf4e8b38c2b8c20fd2973d599b8","64ce841e81efa5122110c42af73b721a51006933","981cddde2b3d53a22aabea153a2707bf66f3d11d","8b058d5fd132225dec31144d2a1611a5baee40c2","239b0204c99432f3dc97b759738886a261069bdc","2b0556424e37a49c46e974d24720994b01db0738","b941b4cd8f106157524bb9e1930375f3c3029cd9","22ef34d79b84d709febd3f5b87d31678888b810f","568c489a0a7930d0ffecf1061e02f34bcc42deca","8ce3d65ab4740dcdb4119420463ed37c677d5a27","5d1cd24bfdfb69fa289704958354058e51f168eb","8fa38fe3be3968dae6fca4b2a44cdfd4e5f8cc2e","93eb28d685d0c8e5dbe34d5be691aff28a0a21e0","9baa36a3411ae70f2cf54fb1a9875f2fa28384eb","182eff394939105950b70995b29f0673199429d0","40d040519a70269f857a52da90bbc48f325a26e7","0cc01e17f76e41e38af0fcc9e22102d449854618","712993dd7ab6b505034bce119f0c44d1e179cc07","19314e7d39a8bbf9eabb70d1c8e9ea2ea5ec3c84","fb6f7b3af06ac246784f3a7e5be5e7859f2111ef","7dbd5061486abb0e310d694d521bf612afc2bec0","055d8a2a068fbd0c43fe57df1d143a9e790eb209","ba59696cbfa7da8a8a2e09bb7e9401de04017647","55301c5097d67833b9c6ba55ab14c94c613f7b69","cc3792eada3b7ced04cb409101fc664e64dcd183","3a8cd5bc30d9ea22aabf47c2c137063862528803","e85caae0c41d6a871562eaf57cf7117f5fa6f94d","0c9bf773471f497195f4c67888a3959236512bbf","5e731b2a1ff0655e996738dfb67934487f3573e1","75ab7c595c858c2ef841609438eeca2dfd82f97f","8994c25ee5730e2358ae22afe08b3b8016db5cd4","c7f9935f2c9d3fba5ca3c87986c0b48ca6c1be24","4715c52d59dc19f82f72353cbc7a4861d25e9be6","5a08ad81a19cbb9d744909394172b5548c4a46ca","8d8d0d31abd57f132b2eb192e1094206ffff4bf0","291ac6fe305840af2de12c73d8aa15b6def5b4d3","5a25125dcbd73fa0fec5a831d49b14a0bab4f869","180b878beac3bdb5dfdfc3217487ca674b77fe9a","e6731bf95a16a0b2f65d3a3094066cb514bedf85","f76d3b019b552fde34d1c2043b254dd7ce8176f5","dcf6bee2827bb1daa02cc96237aa40b54fb2f306","63a4f8ec37d4763ed3b12b304e44b0a281fe51ad","d3cfacc424d860fc6a64569d4f698a69b445828b","35a7f4812d0439359ae2b5caa9182a0c73741cac","3e6fe4ee2444ad5bf2e8bca2da94c905bb1cfe21","3f92132772625fef3abff85a48ad925cbb8abff2","deaf2fbad5cc173049ba710175cf82dd2608beed","75bbade0bcb4110cd2511604da5c4649162f2c57","e8c2926c4f91b88f777611366d466e33d0cea17e","c4ab00511bd57980821ee4a63274b8b595df752b","edf6cbc1246f0c85eb0f653843e294824db310b0","36dcd28a2e5c959b5f32a535168f6ea51102b026","99610755c8612165982237ca45e502756e9f81db","b26e240162230cd54c88791faea70a9342f145aa","c69734fffa06fcdcf10088c6914f30da158c327a","0fcd673694828130059d67a3a99a152d431a774e","ef2d854e9832241f982885512508b605f2c4283f","e581e180e87842ab6f6a51184760c69bb7b485e4","ae6e759059c931bfa16abc0a2418dd73ed1672b8","ea7c4a6e22e151ab6f0cdc0178cfa3b014525eb1","5833917d74b49c3f7d4e103df5824d3398f567ec","e8f8d6d5b0c6ddb55130acfa25e89ff234fc9950","8e43b22de47f360875d4d6d4ad435586b8b4a9e6","918d90ab7cc883f664648558913670034fa89b9f","53e2bcf02771d4eec1109b834d6881fda671e03a","3850f69122890f119599b73b522375f9ffcac095","cda122e33fdcd9d2ded48c59e2a0a9abe2c2aebd","3e3a2829b1a9ca2957aa605a8efc6bba19bae744","8ff0dc45045c06102f88d4d285417567fea60d52","fc3eb70f6fcfffe6ef375be029db07c96c5bbd0b","845f5ffe3845ed5eb50e0a4b4513c7abd55f57d8","a9c76146f022d1efb9c8a059c047eb3a14816709","3f6ac65bf88ffca7458b1d6d53e3ec5feeb47f3b","fbbcef70a665f11a69bdc98751d38c4c437656f0","4ed9ae6c8a216a33fbf7b271178a034b020036ba"],"title":"On meta-analytic assessment of surrogate outcomes.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.3.231"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":1966,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"Two statistical models for the clustered firing of cortical neurones are discussed. The first model assumes that a neurone alternates between periods of inactivity and periods of hypersensitivity during which it fires. The second model assumes a definite causal relation between a spike and the succeeding one. Both models lead to a mixed exponential probability density function for the inter-spike interval. Estimates of the parameters of the second model are obtained from published data, and are used as a basis for discussing the descriptive potential of the model.","inCitations":["84f9c1369bffead475bbc1fa3d124a3b1945f0e4","cc5b4a14e28af8af552f9dc57d0db2aebef6bc96","2206995ebc3648d01ae20df1811b442c58cc50bb","fd422032d22d4d21382c0cc62036c0e8d9c5a19f","9b2e41b6f875de2a60b367cc398471c1a4aa89e2","df67b32bb6be1e81047456032ef5c37db70ec6d2"],"title":"Mathematical models for the clustered firing of single cortical neurones.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1966.tb00365.x"}
