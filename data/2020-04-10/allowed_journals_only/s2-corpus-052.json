However, the mean regression theory breaks down if the error variance is infinite. In addition, correct specification of the likelihood function for existing imputation approach is often challenging in practice, especially for skewed data. In this paper, we develop a novel composite quantile regression and a weighted quantile average estimation procedure for parameter estimation in linear regression models when some responses are missing at random. Instead of imputing the missing response by randomly drawing from its conditional distribution, we propose to impute both missing and observed responses by their estimated conditional quantiles given the observed data and to use the parametrically estimated propensity scores to weigh check functions that define a regression parameter. Both estimation procedures are resistant to heavy-tailed errors or outliers in the response and can achieve nice robustness and efficiency. Moreover, we propose adaptive penalization methods to simultaneously select significant variables and estimate unknown parameters. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are carefully investigated. An efficient algorithm is developed for fast implementation of the proposed methodologies. We also discuss a model selection criterion, which is based on an IC Q -type statistic, to select the penalty parameters. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated via simulated and real data sets.","inCitations":["eda1fb426e6dd6e53e6c6b4ca4c1db6d1544e1b0","f3c87b38825e1193e7286baeb5117b312a68d40d"],"title":"Efficient Robust Estimation for Linear Models with Missing Response at Random.","doi":"10.1111/sjos.12296"}

However, most health effects studies focus on single agents or consider simple two-way interaction models, in part because we lack the statistical methodology to more realistically capture the complexity of mixed exposures. We introduce Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) as a new approach to study mixtures, in which the health outcome is regressed on a flexible function of the mixture (e.g. air pollution or toxic waste) components that is specified using a kernel function. In high-dimensional settings, a novel hierarchical variable selection approach is incorporated to identify important mixture components and account for the correlated structure of the mixture. Simulation studies demonstrate the success of BKMR in estimating the exposure-response function and in identifying the individual components of the mixture responsible for health effects. We demonstrate the features of the method through epidemiology and toxicology applications.","inCitations":["b889da211d245a1d268a9c116ae2b3552a29e76c","9704cc2b30cb8ab794f2d9bf0a83082f49a55cad","1b050671b5d3fd5049d91a0c20cda7c2b48c0e7e","9a71ae27ba1df30db83447b783e6786f30a3bbfd","f33b92cf37e8b2558743d5f05f3153741edc8114","0b4d05f340a8db6a5f3a81c71ffb0c855877f054","8d52d58af750cb90130ba70628133277dde87d2a","f2c1ec7b27a0c285f0710d8cb952c13242ad254a","efe12ca67221131404f25b77d81fecc365ef8257","0b5c1cd3a1f564122b973a146f4814796cbbc2a7","192afc74f853d2fd11b0fa2443c235c21a8f2078","d2999cf1564dbb4dbcf631fae52101bcfd6e0fd1","87640bb1b2aa857eb79408a24a533ade8a5d7eb7","730b917245f2372e37c0be962797b27b70f54700","8c2ae219f396e839fb138fb2501b820c9409c75a","a00a97fe5c0d845c7a9e93214c4e729803c37b57","c98cd19424aaebedddbcb6e2985406238805bc8a","8f0c13ce0edfd005a98bc2693af157aa23affaf0"],"title":"Bayesian kernel machine regression for estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu058"}

Typically this data matrix is transposable, meaning that either the rows, columns or both can be treated as features. To model transposable data, we present a modification of the matrix-variate normal, the mean-restricted matrix-variate normal, in which the rows and columns each have a separate mean vector and covariance matrix. By placing additive penalties on the inverse covariance matrices of the rows and columns, these so called transposable regularized covariance models allow for maximum likelihood estimation of the mean and non-singular covariance matrices. Using these models, we formulate EM-type algorithms for missing data imputation in both the multivariate and transposable frameworks. We present theoretical results exploiting the structure of our transposable models that allow these models and imputation methods to be applied to high-dimensional data. Simulations and results on microarray data and the Netflix data show that these imputation techniques often outperform existing methods and offer a greater degree of flexibility.","inCitations":["a308b551a3dcb84a19e628fe7d3d748b13236bd0","d02e6068d344014b1332140e73f2cd14464280f0","23549fa0de89477d3de99945bb327dd7ca483d26","64b955c52deddcd5db5a1eade47797e484114a85","c0567e4e39441c43369f44d2f9181dfe71c0e238","d2ae4ab27e624f450e5cfb2c6cb317caeb82e516","af6d94731c7ae56003caa63cf271d9ed269b588b","ffa5a394e04da99dfbe8155caeb3fab01e7beeba","295ad0d5637be2a7c177dc8bd1fe6945eaeb006f","73c2df7531e37d6293fbdd7b26ad0e5895f77716","de6bb43c7039a07561ab43a8ec6a4e5cf7a87d29","507e31c548fd03d82913243de757ff95cb9c963c","82e469fab686e94b96638543d2a973a6c054dab3","0630448087f4e7da034d5a510045969a628b02e8","4b32108228345a0f4a75769bebeeb91638603635","ddf41695b7d0be65f699ffc59f99ea6498e0f97c","c58926c856782379e1aebe7193abacfa1c8880f1","4071fb7fcdfda799f3de4a242d08242444cfeae1","b5c9942e467fa17f4e313ac7403c2c27caaca90e","bc01ca64766eb0e8e5b17c6af4dc86c8bfcd4c58","193387f9adf55a3eeb09be81e2c3e2e7660f7dfe","2ab81c6c63065287d69ba7d1fad6f94db17f1fa9","01f207a1c48bcd4ae1f51675093b1e84bc819147","d7c526f2f51131c0f78d1b5a6ec1795b545d525f","85ad5ca3021043218328934b07f98b8f6c23a683","30d9ad3651f6cce5acdcf59a70f25dd74fa6c8d1","6d1ca0c201affdf49c8a91310bc8cd7cec659567","7b52d0dc1faebd61bd69231b91b920372254a8d4","b19c815611a79e44d9bd039da5e8864e86645ae7","b91a31e63748468e156207c633cb2481da462cc7","6b5e99c128b9cd7b7fbc817a2843a47ce8a1c35d","06dd9c3e0df16c84c828fa2b11ccae2db8c2d6e8","e3db05ad9c3e00ae7989c9fd187223d8319fd525","f67afec4226aba674e786698b39b85b124945ddd","3e6febce1d0fecc7f269cfa08f9c24b8fd5c73cb","2e0f1f01a2680bc90b366aaf8a6e49116cddd12b","e516cc51b20098e244dd2997eb3ccb1b57d408dd","aa2edaae5fab4600bfe83367af89106a5d8dd3e6","1f0ec975b22d7664aa3165e0a83140f292f05e41","198cbadaf5d5f8a44cd6c46876427e4f013e9422","869e58fcc4d181cdff2ebf5c9b1c295cc29a3fe6","e3c5330eefa5a263d2671c2418531aa07510efe2","91bc586e75ca65ab26eacdacb9b03e477179251a","3c5cbd903ec024d3db78e1b3c5aa67a3c2b22057","d578ff11a2c1a47fdf7c88ea47d2528b7aae117b","66112f92c52cde13376f791d0b44643c34522316","9a1124b7205616ef4e7218261311ce872efd72c1","2d185ce589538f2b11f26cf04a450f06b93d69c1","1e20a56a50eae790bf40a707379a2e95d94c87b0","ddebdbfc189f25585cb367b69ae15051e9f195d0","954d150a222635d86654a019ff833d9ca2788834","61d643d89d9f87b0f93b74d68bed227ce48792c0","584475a4c49e1d2258de59277bcc5674313736c1","f21de669b6da14ea0ed9a1ac0586fd2fcd5c80f3","0300d4ca14847841d60a955f52ec35051af0c172","46ebc0c907d9f40a93b99e76a3055db90490107c","215ae95658bbb9a910978ec85991153866262890","b6a925ad2c4d9fa0fda616b2999e0b1b954e022d","3399850d6c87c33d252453da03c78b6ad4f6520e","bbde02d99533ad27c1e20447f58e5a6a3fc4e353","d06b7e6be29669329b331a538bdcaf0fdd0a55f2","9a7a4d6fbd8e160c43f102be5732eb60e539ee3c","4d7a833782e1e8e7f43bcbd4f8b4e570133cef31","a80eb63bea6766fc6443e60abb5c47119f732b10","0ed772ed027087f453218be8fefaf211b8dccb3c","e90c9dbbdf324243e1394f722884407fddfe10fc","407b18c598f775d1e268e46cbd6c1b8e3c583af6","29551da2757b25681d9343c5013b5b2740acd86a","c7160b48dfc7008e8e41e08873ff531f37eea69c","e4137796fcb4e5f5cba1fea3b0b8371d950df66b","3c1b59da08de3d15212adfb0a1903c0011ffcf22","fa499a7cb25be1ee090f00a7adc920da2f2e28ab","d7c271b0ad9902ab103c1fdb7eb67d871586748f","3eacf6a59043385e9244192656fef27e865c7c91","d563c07c6b3446bc919f9486b2435e9bc7fb0434","45ea19c4b3a63741b1688294488dc689a16b34b4","04f1e69af1af9bf6c284d6f902f27fc692255ea2"],"title":"Transposable Regularized Covariance Models with an Application to Missing Data Imputation.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS314"}

Structure plays a critical role in defining the function of proteins and is more strongly conserved than amino acid sequence over evolutionary timescales. A key challenge is the identification and evaluation of structural similarity between proteins; such analysis can aid in understanding the role of newly discovered proteins and help elucidate evolutionary relationships between organisms. Computational biologists have developed many clever algorithmic techniques for comparing protein structures, however, all are based on heuristic optimization criteria, making statistical interpretation somewhat difficult. Here we present a fully probabilistic framework for pairwise structural alignment of proteins. Our approach has several advantages, including the ability to capture alignment uncertainty and to estimate key \"gap\" parameters which critically affect the quality of the alignment. We show that several existing alignment methods arise as maximum a posteriori estimates under specific choices of prior distributions and error models. Our probabilistic framework is also easily extended to incorporate additional information, which we demonstrate by including primary sequence information to generate simultaneous sequence-structure alignments that can resolve ambiguities obtained using structure alone. This combined model also provides a natural approach for the difficult task of estimating evolutionary distance based on structural alignments. The model is illustrated by comparison with well-established methods on several challenging protein alignment examples.","inCitations":["94ebb162afbcd6cadcecff8da720e663e7e0de19","5c53d52ebc53fdd95e67d996ab9b65ad4a9abdf9","7c8913f2a50866d0f05a85f8742269cbd86e1c2c","0df02529dbcb39ad23d98cf90ce5879d5200d518","a2ead60ed472b6b7273a75b7ce359d5a6784f80f","daa77ed9257518b436a1c0e154b45baaf1f93656","22421efe5072124391d540da23323ad0b2e21993","cc1c54ef3889121097d6f7df35b54e09d613fc26","c18a3a924d40c0ca27cb2c437cb01ba36a6c1d17"],"title":"Bayesian Protein Structure Alignment.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS780"}

A common practice in supervised machine learning, is thus to test if the estimated accuracy is significantly better than chance level. This method of signal detection is particularly popular in neuroimaging and genetics. We provide evidence that using a classifier's accuracy as a test statistic can be an underpowered strategy for finding differences between populations, compared to a bona fide statistical test. It is also computationally more demanding than a statistical test. Via simulation, we compare test statistics that are based on classification accuracy, to others based on multivariate test statistics. We find that the probability of detecting differences between two distributions is lower for accuracy-based statistics. We examine several candidate causes for the low power of accuracy-tests. These causes include: the discrete nature of the accuracy-test statistic, the type of signal accuracy-tests are designed to detect, their inefficient use of the data, and their suboptimal regularization. When the purpose of the analysis is the evaluation of a particular classifier, not signal detection, we suggest several improvements to increase power. In particular, to replace V-fold cross-validation with the Leave-One-Out Bootstrap.","inCitations":["63d4c78ec8c3deb2f6645cd873e2dbf832793654","abc553da3f547d555cbc58a150ab70518ffeb713","f9a10801db1148a4935688a93236bf208099887f","38a88f0fbd9f5a372a97dd79a4afb4d61aa23d6d","5d70f7dc5349fb48d43906f80db4a97aa6dcee44","c059443263cc74f20f9237bbbd8e7c216530c52d"],"title":"Better-than-chance classification for signal detection.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz035"}

The asymptotic properties of the estimators in both parametric and semi-parametric models are derived, combining the approaches of Parner (2001) and Andersen (2003). The method is mainly studied when the families consist of groups of exchangeable members (e.g. siblings) or members at different levels (e.g. parents and children). The advantages of the proposed method are especially clear in this last case where very flexible modelling is possible. The suggested method is also studied in simulations and found to be efficient compared to maximum likelihood. Finally, the suggested method is applied to a family study of deep venous thromboembolism where it is seen that the association between ages at onset is larger for siblings than for parents or for parents and siblings.","inCitations":["72f05d9d507c65e6b131a04c8d8be651fdd2e6f8","87cfbb1868d340f3ed70afcb8230dd55a50cc1f3","28d6bcf3678c43ac271a25d02c14724857cc20cb","e780eebd2977612622b5a4d25ac9266fd190b8cc","d4561ea877098b9b74c655d178aa280401427e9c","d7e19f959dde55b25c2db6c4a64113db2cd2077f","a588232a180d835a8eecddd29e37c406fd22fdbc","9422199b1b8f5b11f6524d5711e2bea2a140e99e","7f5482965f78c25832fd43e67996ae3594be2a73","82e7744ebb3b5f89983e02f543e32ce518e2ede4","4443edca681660f8f9161c346f111d64a680e105","6068f2c18b15f3ca39bd9b73b1acc8c2ad53149d","c1ad101985c0338bc57fd7aad5e6fd2d1ffc471c","2c9bb30a136e7970ab1505039222b3ff33ddd7ce","e7c9dc8cad403906e4e84df99d9f6b1343bfeb47"],"title":"Composite likelihood and two-stage estimation in family studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.1.15"}

These include least squares means, trimmed means, M-estimators and medians. In addition, some methods begin with a preliminary test to determine the shapes of distributions before adopting a particular estimator of the typical score. We compared a number of recently developed adaptive robust methods with respect to their ability to control Type I error and their sensitivity to detect differences between the groups when data were non-normal and heterogeneous, and the design was unbalanced. In particular, two new approaches to comparing the typical score across treatment groups, due to Babu, Padmanabhan, and Puri, were compared to two new methods presented by Wilcox and by Keselman, Wilcox, Othman, and Fradette. The procedures examined generally resulted in good Type I error control and therefore, on the basis of this critetion, it would be difficult to recommend one method over the other. However, the power results clearly favour one of the methods presented by Wilcox and Keselman; indeed, in the vast majority of the cases investigated, this most favoured approach had substantially larger power values than the other procedures, particularly when there were more than two treatment groups.","inCitations":["fec611fcf7716535e2bf672a8bdcacd47a5abeae","0270a328175ffa4590f0180c801267947a2c260e","c2322425dfa6a59d85ba254d5cb6cad35c3ca0f5","65af98047828e3505879909cb624a720f6403fe4","f9dc07026bc49b1b380c8f244b138628de181be1","d4665b13a0e8188fb9c11390b858b197df8254cd","44ef49bb95c9a6e53224a71f53620170f6c09d57","6bf50fdcc26c1633b345a81aee4da58790cef2ec","b277feb3eaa1c1d13f7fab70693570e91ea95cca","f10f87cdda77ebbf0c3d3a555923ac5cc2fe2df9","605985fd267f282d84c426b5b82bf22be1b3a734","0b3797737d7eff92d16b9e334b7372b1ab5e909e","e5cb6b5d6b46e888f707a1d2e965257ede73622e","941111b86a65474aa850124b23093636585cd32c","1904e9cfd50d31736a7a9fd41e71811c4dcec041","5ed11064088b97d84cdb3efb4fe4eff0f2327766","a9e8a4fb10e6e93cfafbb82b5ce5857b56ac40e3","dc7df3fa8120046cbdfafc3c242e487ab6d31052","550b62996adccb8d9dcfbf9578190a3e1cf9ae7a","8577ef76adbd3e52558ed3b7a8c264eaf96d9af9","2b73177fd609940f748e9aaffae9ff1c3bb93d52"],"title":"Comparing measures of the 'typical' score across treatment groups.","doi":"10.1348/0007110042307159"}

However, classical DL models do not account for possible interactions between lagged predictors. In the presence of interactions between lagged covariates, the total effect of a change on the response is not merely a sum of lagged effects as is typically assumed. This article proposes a new class of models, called high-degree DL models, that extend basic DL models to incorporate hypothesized interactions between lagged predictors. The modeling strategy utilizes Gaussian processes to counterbalance predictor collinearity and as a dimension reduction tool. To choose the degree and maximum lags used within the models, a computationally manageable model comparison method is proposed based on maximum a posteriori estimators. The models and methods are illustrated via simulation and application to investigating the effect of heat exposure on mortality in Los Angeles and New York.","inCitations":["896cf5a934849cbd13ead7a0cc52d56036b8d028","f33b92cf37e8b2558743d5f05f3153741edc8114","24908a378d2accce97bd03f28fa2a11348eb2385","93e610557c0ece94a908f7b88a0d0682a47e9c79","6526a94d1002785113b9d5283e7c5df38fc918b7","c23b9c1945b33c724ab609c6fb35b0c75cfe76ae","8081326137fa8b3b0ce61e87d80347d77b983c4c","ea2b0665b5f3a49f364d8683bc2f49f4970a5571","cdcf678b6040b90420c09a298418f7601ed45588"],"title":"Extending distributed lag models to higher degrees.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt031"}

Adjustment is often straightforward when a discrete covariate partitions the sample into a handful of strata, but becomes more involved with even a single continuous covariate such as age. As randomized experiments remain a gold standard for scientific inquiry, and the information age facilitates a massive collection of baseline information, the longstanding problem of if and how to adjust for covariates is likely to engage investigators for the foreseeable future.In the locally efficient estimation approach introduced for general coarsened data structures by James Robins and collaborators, one first fits a relatively small working model, often with maximum likelihood, giving a nuisance parameter fit in an estimating equation for the parameter of interest. The usual advertisement is that the estimator will be asymptotically efficient if the working model is correct, but otherwise will still be consistent and asymptotically Gaussian.However, by applying standard likelihood-based fits to misspecified working models in covariate adjustment problems, one can poorly estimate the parameter of interest. We propose a new method, empirical efficiency maximization, to optimize the working model fit for the resulting parameter estimate.In addition to the randomized experiment setting, we show how our covariate adjustment procedure can be used in survival analysis applications. Numerical asymptotic efficiency calculations demonstrate gains relative to standard locally efficient estimators.","inCitations":["e0b4a026f7a62b4a44cc3da50d4f1dd56509f4ab","5d7dccc3edb399c223f4f2cc3807291dc771e64a","8d3bbe6ec2909ead5bc034f780c176b5aa0bcfeb","abb89cec7d657aa88335cff7d30e5a395230ba26","408a8653afc38adc7dd3084ec7ca5d12c493d06f","e57e8b54a102ab2677825d22cb8403a16bf5fccd","aece945a38b1177ca3a92a42a700eb2ba6d3b93f","4b51f2ac81d3dfda1c546c08e33e5c49399100aa","8d7d26695485d9a39910e662ad820c6d83f3ead9","977c998b5cfe1ce08a6ad1444c64079eb7939025","00d00349559b116eb19f52584ff5659ad48fcfdd","b5633d0e49beb7a9091d92ce039f39361f2b64fc","bff1a261c93b010c9f280646af16aebeccbb3df2","4d76a996ae6d8372e3ca6ef947ba72930e11eff3","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c","d237d0b857fc17692f3e970460e1103415126ddf","a4d1443a5b0bc8ccbd2c1db9de0e799201570306","271043391d9b28842a2f682964a898372ce767c7","3fd9089e81afdf869f492fd923bb1bc14e306053","3f00a704a295a8165a502c8a99839b5ed18b401d","f5ea7bde1ad500285044ea401e6cde7bc9bcbaf9","23dab9ba5ac7a76d68b2c04c93381293ef557303","9151d84629277bab26148bdb6379626b44e1cd0a","0959b38d531e842918775f02549647faf5863b2f","be85c8ce364b42ff939c4f93715e54c5de5f2aed","fc41ac21596f8d2da1214f9c0fca9f4942639340","b87e4abe9ed5f6aca7e7f8e078fb4344642e7708","4e093584f02b1a1a338fe6d27b4c325aa00a8edb","474400f1519b82a3931644943cd966ddf95c44c3","c0eab2b3f0982d29e1202c7fb347f95dfc97cc2f","2172fd75b7e6e8db47d8f709ceda45c60029363a","1efc98b6a5f82d85b44392a0493649f1f5065666","0db6155cefe66cd45633d21abee2169b23a4d2ec","e2625d7e5f53b417506302dab383a13f8cfa19c9","3b2f0c5e158ebccc8123e732ed79c179826ad865","4150135622a51559c53e6e34c32ccbfa6571fe70","f8cf8f35d47f078fb2cd9ee179bcd68eae08ddc6","0d586fe9be1f4549341d09701a4af439fc74d772","474958b63ee8702f7f3f51996044f222074f11d3","9d8b4582ee8b09f641a9f1b196d7b6d10217dfd1","cc2cfe9a8b66e604742108b819d84825f6dff664","bd580bb56b1a70595a36f6bc5db6cf8195b15975","fcc5452d54a6abd5431d8b90e0d24c014f645d0f","b29b81aacc6182e58e10e71a72fd23ec43e67add"],"title":"Empirical Efficiency Maximization: Improved Locally Efficient Covariate Adjustment in Randomized Experiments and Survival Analysis","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1084"}

One is a method of confidence set with confidence coefficient 0.95 improving the conventional 0.95 confidence interval in the producer's risk and also the consumer's risk in some cases. It requires to include 0 within the region as well as to clear the non-inferiority margin so that a trial with somewhat large number of subjects and inappropriately large non-inferiority margin for proving non-inferiority of a drug that is actually inferior should be unsuccessful. The other is the closed testing procedure which combines the one- and two-sided tests by applying the partitioning principle and justifies the switching procedure by unifying the non-inferiority, equivalence and superiority tests. In particular regarding the non-inferiority, the proposed method justifies simultaneously the old Japanese Statistical Guideline (one-sided 0.05 test) and the International Guideline ICH E9 (one-sided 0.025 test). The method is particularly attractive, changing the strength of the evidence of relative efficacy of the test drug against a control at five levels according to the achievement of the clinical trial. The meaning of the non-inferiority test and also the rationale of switching from it to superiority test will be discussed.","inCitations":["925be423f9089c137eb22f11543fd147b6e63431","25df9cfcf0103a9ccd93d15081f74679836eac5b"],"title":"A unifying approach to non-inferiority, equivalence and superiority tests via multiple decision processes.","doi":"10.1002/pst.305"}

Data-driven dynamic treatment regimes can offer guidance for clinicians and intervention scientists on how to treat patients over time in order to bring about the most favorable clinical outcome on average. Methods for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes, such as Q-learning, typically require modeling nonsmooth, nonmonotone transformations of data. Thus, building well-fitting models can be challenging and in some cases may result in a poor estimate of the optimal treatment regime. Interactive Q-learning (IQ-learning) is an alternative to Q-learning that only requires modeling smooth, monotone transformations of the data. The R package iqLearn provides functions for implementing both the IQ-learning and Q-learning algorithms. We demonstrate how to estimate a two-stage optimal treatment policy with iqLearn using a generated data set bmiData which mimics a two-stage randomized body mass index reduction trial with binary treatments at each stage.","inCitations":["e33caeb68e69b33345e1cd9ec9a747cb11c5af0c","858effd10b711ad6c86eff9c32cdc0bc320a6e1a"],"title":"iqLearn: Interactive Q-Learning in R.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v064.i01"}

Weighted versions of kappa enable partial credit to be awarded for near agreement, most notably in the case of ordinal categories. An exact significance test for weighted kappa can be conducted by enumerating all rater agreement tables with the same fixed marginal frequencies as the observed table, and accumulating the probabilities for all tables that produce a weighted kappa index that is greater than or equal to the observed measure. Unfortunately, complete enumeration of all tables is computationally unwieldy for modest values of N and K. We present an implicit enumeration algorithm for conducting an exact test of weighted kappa, which can be applied to tables of non-trivial size. The algorithm is particularly efficient for 'good' to 'excellent' values of weighted kappa that typically have very small p-values. Therefore, our method is beneficial for situations where resampling tests are of limited value because the number of trials needed to estimate the p-value tends to be large.","inCitations":["8abdde9fb1064d2a0b39c889bda7ddc0ef56222f","b7c872d9248edcd2ef4845399d415aae5f0f3eda"],"title":"An implicit enumeration method for an exact test of weighted kappa.","doi":"10.1348/000711007X227058"}

In addition, we discuss other non-parametric tests of hypotheses that are similar, but not identical, to the hypothesis of equal AUCs, but that often have better statistical properties than do AUC tests and may be more scientifically appropriate for many settings.","inCitations":["67a06d5a9aba7d9e9ecaaabf6f1b878abb6a072f","b4402075b3cacfebbe5f8b14262238ed4a4a3eef","5ce2923599aa790d7ec79f9d6779fe9aeffcb39a","bfdc7b3647af51f8553775b7fa78f90b3a23a375","e65ce27664fae6f854b9dc2457b3acc1544f2aa8","9fae1c9485a653e4da898f966f008dcfd7b9e599","f92aa7ebd7c1ce743913223dbcd3b14514b7ab47","98740a8a7f8b89c021e222efdaad83224f052c5e"],"title":"Two-Sample Tests of Area-Under-the-Curve in the Presence of Missing Data","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1068"}
