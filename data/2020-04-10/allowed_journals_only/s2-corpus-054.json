Undoubtedly, adaptive designs may affect almost all phases of clinical development and impact nearly all aspects of clinical trial planning, execution and statistical inference. Thus, it is a significant accomplishment for the Office of Biostatistics to develop this well-thought-out and all-encompassing guidance document. In this paper, we discuss some critical topical issues of adaptive designs with supporting methodological work from either existing literature, additional technical notes, or accompanying papers. In particular, we provide numerous sources of design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation bias that arise from statistical procedures. We illustrate, as a result, and caution that substantial research is necessary for many adaptive designs to meet required scientific standards prior to their applications in clinical trials.","inCitations":["a787944feeef0daa0a4f2283bda7ff04128e13a0","faf878c197c86a5e437fd40fd6b7360ac247dad4","fe702c36320a86139292c2ae7f87e1810e744913","93a1dcbafdc61beb0fa6179cfa9c755a06803cbe","b49913cfdf710617c46da4f1763d1433fb73f2c1","dca84b067b4127e5fd9a587e5eec0d6af37c55b5","85fe9dced2252ccf8bba0ad9f0c4a2ad9a9a869a","9618c9e22b80100b005c223ecc7b772dea74e98c"],"title":"Understanding the FDA guidance on adaptive designs: historical, legal, and statistical perspectives.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.514462"}

Thus, microbiome research has the potential to reshape clinical and therapeutic approaches. However, raw microbiome count data require careful pre-processing steps that take into account both the sparsity of counts and the large number of taxa that are being measured. Filtering is defined as removing taxa that are present in a small number of samples and have small counts in the samples where they are observed. Despite progress in the number and quality of filtering approaches, there is no consensus on filtering standards and quality assessment. This can adversely affect downstream analyses and reproducibility of results across platforms and software. We introduce PERFect, a novel permutation filtering approach designed to address two unsolved problems in microbiome data processing: (i) define and quantify loss due to filtering by implementing thresholds and (ii) introduce and evaluate a permutation test for filtering loss to provide a measure of excessive filtering. Methods are assessed on three \"mock experiment\" data sets, where the true taxa compositions are known, and are applied to two publicly available real microbiome data sets. The method correctly removes contaminant taxa in \"mock\" data sets, quantifies and visualizes the corresponding filtering loss, providing a uniform data-driven filtering criteria for real microbiome data sets. In real data analyses PERFect tends to remove more taxa than existing approaches; this likely happens because the method is based on an explicit loss function, uses statistically principled testing, and takes into account correlation between taxa.

The geodesics that correspond to this metric are available in closed-form and-within the context of Lagrangian Monte Carlo-provide a principled way to travel around the space of positive definite matrices. Our method improves Bayesian inference on such matrices by allowing for a broad range of priors, so we are not limited to conjugate priors only. In the context of spectral density estimation, we use the (non-conjugate) complex reference prior as an example modeling option made available by the algorithm. Results based on simulated and real-world multivariate time series are presented in this context, and future directions are outlined.","inCitations":["85f6882c126529b2af87004f63c1487a4e2ef167","71ebec1a3e6292a1cf570b97ee8ec3003c3a52fb","e279d5fcd94baafcbbbf06f8f25584496d6be894","e7917a1085ebcad30a6f490491a6b49f2a408c2f","71c3c838d8912385c3d99be9d41e29da3602e795","8d373f971018d13c25029853f21fd9cc91bd1127","77e4dd65e2d79af66a8b4e0ee14780285ce3ccd2","14fafd5adc1714a2ce3a309ed4c5b441ba7004ca","6d31b58f76837a4dcb31d7e83980c180f2e7348b","c8be953bd000c0d2e798b455bd2a718f63ce3292","f978fefedd5011b318d7600717ce18a5c080cbed"],"title":"Geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo over the space of positive definite matrices: with application to Bayesian spectral density estimation.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2017.1416470"}

Group therapy is often delivered under a rolling (or open) admissions policy, where new clients are continuously enrolled into a group as space permits. Rolling admissions policies result in a complex correlation structure among client outcomes. Despite the ubiquity of rolling admissions in practice, little guidance on the analysis of such data is available. We discuss the limitations of previously proposed approaches in the context of a study that delivered group cognitive behavioral therapy for depression to clients in residential substance abuse treatment. We improve upon previous rolling group analytic approaches by fully modeling the interrelatedness of client depressive symptom scores using a hierarchical Bayesian model that assumes a conditionally autoregressive prior for session-level random effects. We demonstrate improved performance using our method for estimating the variance of model parameters and the enhanced ability to learn about the complex correlation structure among participants in rolling therapy groups. Our approach broadly applies to any group therapy setting where groups have changing client composition. It will lead to more efficient analyses of client-level data and improve the group therapy research community's ability to understand how the dynamics of rolling groups lead to client outcomes.","inCitations":["6bfaf84a2bb6ca897be68902f5eac047334ff4dd","8310f4f48229273d50acbdd60b339ae0af7531f1","ce17d280de28f37020d985240fcbeb2485279e05","ccd2960a4b190e8aec142da32b09ebed5b8eecae","13407e04245d3db498bc06830c4d2abed92dbb90","bc796dc9238c0735087a028d8809a189554241e1","45dd90576b48e9ad77aae4f59e4482cb72109aae","cfbfb55a44f5e2cea71476c911b66e1c69dae11a"],"title":"Analysis of Rolling Group Therapy Data Using Conditionally Autoregressive Priors.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS434"}

Its formulation is constructive, based on an accounting of the unique cohorts in the population as they arise and evolve over time, allowing it to be written in closed form. The model can attribute effects to subsets of the population, providing flexibility not available using the models historically applied to these populations. It provides a tool for in silico synchronization of the population and can be used to deconvolve population-level experimental measurements, such as temporal expression profiles. It also allows for the direct comparison of assay measurements made from multiple experiments. The model can be fit either to budding index or DNA content measurements, or both, and is easily adaptable to new forms of data. The ability to use DNA content data makes the model applicable to almost any organism. We describe the model and illustrate its utility and flexibility in a study of cell cycle progression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","inCitations":["29a4ea2221e2ac4cd8e3d71236fb8780237bcdc3","78619a2f3e25918dfd3aefee7fe041090ea5e312","07fcf18907947c913d7eab660165e34691b14462","1923b70b5cd8ae11c3ab85500154654a3a529e29","4bc94f748986280f53ec8a015e2843943184890c","ce9166b2986dd4821668190ca1c9a3d672ce8a77","b0a0651579bf9d22fd2cbd44a13bde192329d190","220ef63c6b01c6d10b365305e1e267c6eddcdb14","719c184004dbbfc687f300526d963f419f34e8df","cd5d3d05044455156bf84646f09baa480ba25ceb","98c08ca9cbbc4f6b78e90de920ee02f994c9bd26","318df6ac841acd86425849c77f692f453cbfa5f8"],"title":"A branching process model for flow cytometry and budding index measurements in cell synchrony experiments.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS264"}

This simulation study considers three distributions: normal, Poisson, and uniform at quantile levels of 0.8 and 0.9 for cases with and without contamination. Study endpoints include the bias of TDI estimates (compared with their respective theoretical values), standard error of TDI estimates (compared with their true simulated standard errors), and test size (compared with 0.05), and power. Nonparametric TDI using quantile regression, although it slightly underestimates and delivers slightly less power for data without contamination, works satisfactorily under all simulated cases even for moderate (say, ≥40) sample sizes. The performance of the TDI based on a quantile of 0.8 is in general superior to that of 0.9. The performances of nonparametric and parametric TDI methods are compared with a real data example. Nonparametric TDI can be very useful when the underlying distribution on the difference is not normal, especially when it has a heavy tail.","inCitations":["00bfac2e71ca84fbe0519b9953137151526d4bc8"],"title":"A simulation study of nonparametric total deviation index as a measure of agreement based on quantile regression.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1094812"}

Nonetheless, these pitfalls are largely overlooked in contemporary clinical and epidemiological research, which routinely uses ratio variables in statistical analyses. This article aims to demonstrate how very different findings can be generated as a result of less than perfect correlations among the data used to generate ratio variables. These imperfect correlations result from measurement error and random biological variation. While the former can often be reduced by improvements in measurement, random biological variation is difficult to estimate and eliminate in observational studies. Moreover, wherever the underlying biological relationships among epidemiological variables are unclear, and hence the choice of statistical model is also unclear, the different findings generated by different analytical strategies can lead to contradictory conclusions. Caution is therefore required when interpreting analyses of ratio variables whenever the underlying biological relationships among the variables involved are unspecified or unclear.","inCitations":["0e0f6b193f8ef09d4f07d92cf14ceb8a1f2ca40a"],"title":"Ratio index variables or ANCOVA?

This adaptive design was developed in the context of a drug under development for treatment of major depression, but is easily extended to any setting with a continuous efficacy and a dichotomous tolerability or safety variable. The goal is to identify a target dose that was most efficacious while still being safe. Via simulations under various scenarios we show that our design performs extremely efficiently. Our design incorporates stopping rules, adaptive allocation, and dose-response estimation (for both efficacy and tolerability), among other features. We present various metrics from our simulation study, and conclude that this is an extremely efficient way of characterizing the risk-benefit profile of a drug during clinical development.","inCitations":["e66fffa83565ab82f759a4bf00e82bde541cb624","349f8429d9bc0bebb3f3206f7059182fcbbf2feb","003fbde6a92c21ca4c3428e6527cd0f7954e91f1","7cda6e41d8c882ded9a51d3d0c79290b615e2cd1"],"title":"A bayesian dose-finding design adapting to efficacy and tolerability response.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.531414"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2014,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The equivalence assessment is often conducted through a three-arm clinical trial (namely, test, reference, and placebo) and it usually consists of three tests. The first two tests are to demonstrate the superiority of the test and the reference treatment to the placebo, and they are followed by an equivalence test between the test treatment and the reference treatment. When the response variable is continuous, equivalence is commonly defined in terms of mean difference, mean ratio, or ratio of mean differences, that is, the mean difference of the test and the placebo to the mean difference of the reference and the placebo. These equivalence tests can be performed with both a hypothesis-testing approach and a confidence-interval approach. The advantage of applying the equivalence test by ratio of mean differences is that it can test both superiority of the test treatment over placebo and equivalence between the test and the reference simultaneously through a single hypothesis. In this article, we derive the test statistics and the power function for the ratio of mean differences hypothesis and solve the required sample size for a three-arm clinical trial. Examples of required sample size are given in this article, and are compared with the required sample size by the traditional mean difference equivalence test. After a careful examination, we suggest increasing the power of the ratio of mean differences approach by appropriately adjusting the lower limit of the equivalence interval.","inCitations":["812a477385d204e9d390271e3d60e71513bc0b4b","a3587ce13b224c0f7582b2e536d92cf607528cb6"],"title":"Sample size determination for a three-arm equivalence trial of normally distributed responses.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.948552"}

This method generates a measure of predictor criticality, which is distinct from and has several advantages over traditional indices of predictor importance. Using the bootstrapping (resampling with replacement) procedure, a large number of samples are obtained from a given data set which contains one response variable and p predictors. For each sample, all 2p-1 subset regression models are fitted and the best subset model is selected. Thus, the (multinomial) distribution of the probability that each of the 2p-1 subsets is 'the best' model for the data set is obtained. A predictor's criticality is defined as a function of the probabilities associated with the models that include the predictor. That is, a predictor which is included in a large number of probable models is critical to the identification of the best-fitting regression model and, therefore, to the prediction of the response variable. The procedure can be applied to fixed and random regression models and can use any measure of goodness of fit (e.g., adjusted R2, Cp, AIC) for identifying the best model. Several criticality measures can be defined by using different combinations of the probabilities of the best-fitting models, and asymptotic confidence intervals for each variable's criticality can be derived. The procedure is illustrated with several examples.","inCitations":["ce6dfd15f11ff5b6c6122efc2729c09fa06aae1a","8a15ae7c57a2b8cf250654853e70c5836f2f1516","a0a95d2853f22809c72335664405ce2ee9554f42","b87f4cd60f2a694db48701b8ec9381499999c265","f1bb7c663144c85876d989a1a2514ddc4f7c2b6f","e9f4878b529304c268b9ed36066f60449c931104","a88ffd15909d82ab7e5358abc9e83abffe904e2e","a34033365a9d81604cbd73e80c4d16eefd828e7e","e6201bb0fe74c63669030c41bc6272fa2fa1aa97","bb2671eb7d172dabc788442be99c309d65e7d19e","92ca25a98616fc5c5d98e9c7edbd65cba91d56ea","963656d161ae5ef00977848ba92e3751e4fd2557","4544ec96d5ec6e71f7795fa5498f542cb9985c7a","52448edc5c8af5a4404d3af36b28bbe021ea3a63","3ebc96305c86c1ad2fa771ce6cf2c338db07a66b","8a6e36d61289a185c4eeb10efbceeb4dbb7cc5f8"],"title":"Criticality of predictors in multiple regression.","doi":"10.1348/000711001159483"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"We consider a situation where there is rich historical data available for the coefficients and their standard errors in an established regression model describing the association between a binary outcome variable Y and a set of predicting factors X, from a large study. We would like to utilize this summary information for improving estimation and prediction in an expanded model of interest, Y| X, B. The additional variable B is a new biomarker, measured on a small number of subjects in a new dataset. We develop and evaluate several approaches for translating the external information into constraints on regression coefficients in a logistic regression model of Y| X, B. Borrowing from the measurement error literature we establish an approximate relationship between the regression coefficients in the models Pr(Y = 1| X , β), Pr(Y = 1| X, B, γ) and E(B| X, θ ) for a Gaussian distribution of B. For binary B we propose an alternate expression. The simulation results comparing these methods indicate that historical information on Pr(Y = 1| X , β) can improve the efficiency of estimation and enhance the predictive power in the regression model of interest Pr(Y = 1| X, B, γ). We illustrate our methodology by enhancing the High-grade Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator, with two new biomarkers prostate cancer antigen 3 and TMPRSS2:ERG.","inCitations":["f5281f8c633b665ccbc4c2778a46e248620864c9"],"title":"Informing a Risk Prediction Model for Binary Outcomes with External Coefficient Information.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12306"}

By adaptive design, we mean in this setting a RCT design that allows the investigator to dynamically modify its course through data-driven adjustment of the randomization probability based on data accrued so far, without negatively impacting on the statistical integrity of the trial. By adaptive group sequential design, we refer to the fact that group sequential testing methods can be equally well applied on top of adaptive designs. We obtain that, theoretically, the adaptive design converges almost surely to the targeted unknown randomization scheme. In the estimation framework, we obtain that our maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter of interest is a strongly consistent estimator, and it satisfies a central limit theorem. We can estimate its asymptotic variance, which is the same as that it would feature had we known in advance the targeted randomization scheme and independently sampled from it. Consequently, inference can be carried out as if we had resorted to independent and identically distributed (iid) sampling. In the testing framework, we obtain that the multidimensional t-statistic that we would use under iid sampling still converges to the same canonical distribution under adaptive sampling. Consequently, the same group sequential testing can be carried out as if we had resorted to iid sampling. Furthermore, a comprehensive simulation study that we undertake in a companion article validates the theory. A three-sentence take-home message is “Adaptive designs do learn the targeted optimal design and inference, and testing can be carried out under adaptive sampling as they would under the targeted optimal randomization probability iid sampling. In particular, adaptive designs achieve the same efficiency as the fixed oracle design. This is confirmed by a simulation study, at least for moderate or large sample sizes, across a large collection of targeted randomization probabilities.'”","inCitations":["0f0ad2626fdaa25b336ddd2f9ab071cfaf18b544","9263f291f0e50212fb62aeb43a4d59088f188a12","1f3c83e84d2111795508c7cab4ab6103689ef73b","a4d1443a5b0bc8ccbd2c1db9de0e799201570306","cf58ae558b11019a69a8a7665a25c220dd0cff4d","22ede5ecd73ea793ab020456b4b5f9aeba48160c","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c","1b3824f6f96041bab23e29c8ea929fbe3dff2ac8","9c4ec3c9f5ad7a85123b40c7ad1eb44f4eb6eed6","fcedc83519202a20064bd078d8dfbb3e97b10cbe","a8e7b5d20dea4ca311a6d6dd55e5d2fe022ba0f0","028ce7614231076b4afc20eb3b55aa61c3980263","209928f2019676a868b7f0becd4da023e77a086c","bdf92a902e8a833b7df0d094605b0f6693904bb9","3f00a704a295a8165a502c8a99839b5ed18b401d"],"title":"Targeting the Optimal Design in Randomized Clinical Trials with Binary Outcomes and No Covariate: Theoretical Study","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1247"}

Two-part mixed models with correlated random effects are an attractive approach to characterize the complex structure of longitudinal semicontinuous data. In practice, however, an independence assumption about random effects in these models may often be made for convenience and computational feasibility. In this article, we show that bias can be induced for regression coefficients when random effects are truly correlated but misspecified as independent in a 2-part mixed model. Paralleling work on bias under nonignorable missingness within a shared parameter model, we derive and investigate the asymptotic bias in selected settings for misspecified 2-part mixed models. The performance of these models in practice is further evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, the potential bias is investigated when artificial zeros, due to left censoring from some detection or measuring limit, are incorporated. To illustrate, we fit different 2-part mixed models to the data from the University of Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Clinic, the aim being to examine whether there are differential effects of disease activity and damage on physical functioning as measured by the health assessment questionnaire scores over the course of psoriatic arthritis. Some practical issues on variance component estimation revealed through this data analysis are considered.","inCitations":["077d9b284e88b564ecb1427524f3fbd9d5a9f4b6","27c5534111a40dcd4e3ffde7e54c83a39abaf7ed","8600099cb90135937a5c96e0db8f72ed0613e270","1825ff33e8ea612cfe1e4deb168eb1ea957af79f","0d672832b26032fd67630cc7cbf0cbf4e7497056","e29305e6a0ecf8794c3d8ffef304ffe56ebd5926","d526300b3ba78ed93a08b47531363fd17c56ece8","118207498b3f52a862f416c787208c943d77c979","1d2f6b718b127569213314916995c180bcf72b98","b622dfffdb15dd62a1be44dc001829a6cdcf0681","dbe8b415186e5975b8577287730d49fee4d2c133","465e9fa3e6bf5c427312b54410b0142b20abaf59","269400b429005ab47372b30f71e16bd57854023e","dadb04c0c70836d3c181862d66774974c9b1f479","e970a941bc89fc95213289a397bd45efc6bc15a9","36f68a2ac01d47738f583c9975e88e9c9ad65302","cf30bdb595b3eadd8660893f69d1aae55d26be3b","e8f41c2152a86c72fa1cba14b117dab58d2f9464","faf70947c948d80fc68e817a9d0a2f926b232a75","3ee8ffcc311fb39029591f53fa38ff164d00b9d1","3e3ec08f4c6ac50ec8a0044624c05e03587aad3a","db1f595161576ae187da4c66a74c3dc97a5f5542","3f1e71491a2243e94e98bf398f1f17fbf602f461","aaaa776cf7787733a4efcef405b72faf40bc8ef3","671143cb76f15a1519343fe5ccfe38fdd86f33ff","fffea453266d4df452ede9f93968d503b07ca409","0fbf338ca0e255fb31ec81be6f855b4467236088","4f29d54abd59761626a506492d491be311d63e02","cf9effe87228448c8c1f1cd5f2f847e991934e60","7b0ec56c91e9462f8d0571664885e0c78ed75b88","60e71bed6fff5f782b84434c61f61f72f4a37cad","0024dc7636234f871e818d1adf317ea3486e887a","590b49a22ebe090ac3e0af906df7a45fb8b58651","4c311e04b79643e3f923d36fe5c9a0bb2c4ac334","1d36962b0d5919ef0fc44ebedafd5d60ba3233dc","a1db478b98cb1ff9887eae15d9263364c5f6647b","350d551890a6cff7353b1d644ba237efaa298524","684e2b8c84f48cbde6d29d592be2e5a92ccf9c17","d23bbb4a226d32e25527875c0a123e021e417ba2","36e6427a0440b6dd832ce5eb1c80bbd6c01fb2ec","6a24df6b39ca40bcf87f8f2fe7738b900a3b0828","1d4e40f0b37d1e57fefb0eef4e8dbf47b04d9ac6","ca627a3a21cefcb911b47adba7d895264ae88ae8"],"title":"Bias in 2-part mixed models for longitudinal semicontinuous data","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn044"}
