Most current approaches have concentrated on bivariate models at a single sequence position. There is, however, considerable value in simultaneously modeling angle pairs at multiple sequence positions in a protein. One area of application for such models is in structure prediction for the highly variable loop and turn regions. Such modeling is difficult due to the fact that the number of known protein structures available to estimate these torsion angle distributions is typically small. Furthermore, the data is \"sparse\" in that not all proteins have angle pairs at each sequence position. We propose a new semiparametric model for the joint distributions of angle pairs at multiple sequence positions. Our model accommodates sparse data by leveraging known information about the behavior of protein secondary structure. We demonstrate our technique by predicting the torsion angles in a loop from the globin fold family. Our results show that a template-based approach can now be successfully extended to modeling the notoriously difficult loop and turn regions.","inCitations":["45d6ab9bf8dbeef2e0f5eeffa7efef9a5ce3ae87","68bd159f63c8f15ab4e465e74174f73badc79d0a","7932be51ba9344f49e3880b3363080eed14f57a4","61e398215fe63be8e213a9eccf8132f9d1081f02","2b3b4fb76ff05a351c91fadc2fca5cb4e148dcfd","9c51e6620482f8a1702e20418175ad23383e1761","569d62c241254af6133a9e475f48b07ecc95cc34","4cd32b6e458fd56c83f495459b9c166fe4c4e396","360611b74cf2ddbaa2d1a6bf27c6ec5de8a61465","251791292657f5b3cc6f764a0d1fec63910655ee","4ad219ec789fb7d0d982f08c3eea9e102c41f363","7c561e9ca10f1960622a3eca7cfa980f2243dd11","18d975490bab38366de6898a7b3ed56d7a04a9c9","3ede073791654043e480b92a893fcfbbc68ff7fd","31e5a8ab20d58e0c2081835c7f7f04ea2afef77d"],"title":"A Dirichlet Process Mixture of Hidden Markov Models for Protein Structure Prediction.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS296"}

Knowledge can be acquired through the study of an expanding literature found in a diverse set of publishing forums. We propose that structural equation modelling publications can be roughly classified into two groups: (a) technical and (b) substantive applications. Technical materials focus on the procedures rather than substantive conclusions derived from applications. The focus of this article is the former category; included are foundational/major contributions, minor contributions, critical and evaluative reviews, integrations, simulations and computer applications, precursor and historical material, and pedagogical textbooks. After a brief introduction, we annotate 294 articles in the technical category dating back to Sewall Wright (1921).","inCitations":["0a7a0582ad402b767aff5605d3c8986bd85c7d12","f6448bd59dfad741a3b14928166f8c9f5c6b808c","1d8d413a64f56d7b2c01edbacd0b72d1deb4228f","035b0a13157e705de8fab30d52c1d82bde2d2e26","0711d8a546a74687c43ac5069dc1e52ad2bc7671","eb88d5cddf45ed989a1e41d54050d6e9c111c0e3","d1ced9b73c972e4db542e142ffa9dedba7eac11f","85ef6ad9edb266b984f7e185db3653ff81ef5027","002d6623a263900ba4807b21122769b52486d877","fc76ce2d44adef80b38cf972b1a67079d1b95760"],"title":"Annotated bibliography of structural equation modelling: technical work.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1991.tb00952.x"}

In September 2007 the CHMP issued a recommendation to review the document, with particular emphasis on summarizing and critically appraising the pattern of drop-outs, explaining the role and limitations of the 'last observation carried forward' method and describing the CHMP's cautionary stance on the use of mixed models. In preparation for the release of the updated guidance document, statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry held a one-day expert group meeting in September 2008. Topics that were debated included minimizing the extent of missing data and understanding the missing data mechanism, defining the principles for handling missing data and understanding the assumptions underlying different analysis methods. A clear message from the meeting was that at present, biostatisticians tend only to react to missing data. Limited pro-active planning is undertaken when designing clinical trials. Missing data mechanisms for a trial need to be considered during the planning phase and the impact on the objectives assessed. Another area for improvement is in the understanding of the pattern of missing data observed during a trial and thus the missing data mechanism via the plotting of data; for example, use of Kaplan-Meier curves looking at time to withdrawal.","inCitations":["217b9b03ece50ce89c2d862888ca3716841f1ea8","ac86d32eddf20485815b62f13971e963e829b571","278128fbb2954b0c200c1cf8d07bfaf5b44230de","29f3485e2dbe9e34a72a93704828f1e7666471df","b198a3aae4901d847d78d956ab95766971cda534","5d8b615a75944055e2a73aef01176059a0eeed9a","1fddf6c04a27302d44e26ff0b54b4b9bf634c3ed","e7f687cf50716ab71b48f95076c86faf86c41af4","3a87edd619d7baba6324c364987584fad054878a","13af64544678013e0d897d90be430776e5ef2e91","9d3300fdbfc8b86978b471c1ad249040c3e25c7b","e026c6065355f2d44587587ef3eb1b551956c787","9454ee526c4285147165180c6a7f4a13a92728ed","22ce74467b3fb0f2c98bbde59c155d21155294bb","5962cedd44bbcef6b749e111e8f5bb3834afe6ac","d6c7c18d9fed014e436c379b578f2d9c38de684d","599a266a17f337b17e78fa388c795d9d916c5fb9","7905a24a6714fca40a8cc887caf6c6b91b9d4758","ced8dbfb3973af7249169891c6a41776e1080c8c"],"title":"Missing data: discussion points from the PSI missing data expert group.","doi":"10.1002/pst.391"}

Nonetheless, such categorization is thought to be more robust and interpretable, and thus their goal is to fit the categorical model and interpret the categorical parameters. We address the question: with measurement error and categorization, how can we do what epidemiologists want, namely to estimate the parameters of the categorical model that would have been estimated if the true predictor was observed? We develop a general methodology for such an analysis, and illustrate it in linear and logistic regression. Simulation studies are presented and the methodology is applied to a nutrition data set.

Results showed that when the missingness mechanism is random-slope-dependent MNAR, TLME estimates of both the mean intercept and mean slope are biased because of incorrect weights used in the estimation. More specifically, the estimate of the mean slope is biased towards the mean slope for completers, whereas the estimate of the mean intercept is biased towards the opposite direction as compared to the estimate of the mean slope. We also discuss why the PM approach can provide unbiased fixed-effects estimates for random-coefficients-dependent MNAR data but does not work well for missing at random or outcome-dependent MNAR data. A small simulation study was conducted to illustrate the results and to compare results from TLME and PM. Results from an empirical data analysis showed that the conceptual finding can be generalized to other real conditions even when some assumptions for the analytical derivation cannot be met. Implications from the analytical and empirical results were discussed and sensitivity analysis was suggested for longitudinal data analysis with missing data.","inCitations":["87d3b509eca1228aae3dda3ea60a4cd93bfb5b06","b6b1afcd00449400d1200344383b997fc0112570","66d64209c0a987739438a03dde1deaa41233c87d"],"title":"Bias in longitudinal data analysis with missing data using typical linear mixed-effects modelling and pattern-mixture approach: an analytical illustration.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12043"}

The idea is to compare a case's exposure immediately prior to or during the case-defining event with that same person's exposure at otherwise similar \"reference\" times. An alternative approach to the analysis of daily exposure and case-only data is time series analysis. Here, log-linear regression models express the expected total number of events on each day as a function of the exposure level and potential confounding variables. In time series analyses of air pollution, smooth functions of time and weather are the main confounders. Time series and case-crossover methods are often viewed as competing methods. In this paper, we show that case-crossover using conditional logistic regression is a special case of time series analysis when there is a common exposure such as in air pollution studies. This equivalence provides computational convenience for case-crossover analyses and a better understanding of time series models. Time series log-linear regression accounts for overdispersion of the Poisson variance, while case-crossover analyses typically do not. This equivalence also permits model checking for case-crossover data using standard log-linear model diagnostics.","inCitations":["54446249ff4f6a66b07cea05b5b50fef5c90bcbf","129bc291993f33b57ac50f3dc2072f6945ab906a","1bd0375f111bb677cc95eda574305a1b643b0803","31d139090d4ca0e31be35eb7c178a9f855d40ee8","2876d2773b17c7b4184cf48b58f40151c8301d58","2f8986d14d09619e15bf16b868cf9c85c3babebb","43da0a04e21d4df208ee824490b73dc7694d4e91","b292ab249440cc41d27c3c18219212cd4acea4c5","199670cca5d54763609eff84e108a21e03c29447","787f4d45061d84008bd54264288334922f969995","2bcaf11b23a0fc9a20f508df592f3c1b3f205732","3f3ad7983c2944225539f5987967ef20d33b80d3","af3def3d1492100fad8c736214f3516f766de2fa","0aa00a68d8c5fa05c4315ffe6f8425dd0429a00a","e870cbc6b39cf6291ef63c3deea1c27af35db812","23e86284325380f42e43f795f14a4373e432b0fb","996f5d28ca4e8f831803dd82afdf64e9ed2e7664","4fe1e202e0e6fda818e920dd24690d1ec4b2133f","72ad99ea804dc4c8728cc952ea7480bf94642969","45bbe7732a8941e4131c395b849e1fbd6a9f22a2","f63818f09395a7e7f1a314394fa737198f36daed","bd5306f07ccb0634e710e61d2dc766e76955e7a4","fbe72f5a7a4707c19ccf10018bca6c9e85964a86","76852376dc0050743121075f59c89fbcc4c98011","dd72960b7115f77599a9336c77cf1a35a27e09de","75c213ba38ca303defdb26eaafc4d5f226ea5d8e","0a797d6a7790d49a655171cddf836154963b0d13","73ee168cdce0f21b8dd9b6049a7f431cceae849f","d25e8927e011b95124633e6bba070044e3a8b043","87a81e1d34658fc37b83d092053ad99af8bc7b3e","47036d3d13b3268c5d49cfd06ac77b3765c596df","9c1730ed59e0b90ef7ea207d9fdd754f61ec7c18","6053d4f2e4f647c5b2bd4c8ea7793afcb721641f","01ecfb8d91fba6a3db58c8a7104fd7303ef0a085","93ff3dd315640ad57881848fb945877e2ac83e8c","ca8a28879692a41160cce7e927705455a4e57858","17bfb26c1e5ddc80a963db6113012c078f74207b","7bcd59cabc739b738e9190e2467fd47ad4311a15","ce72637a610571c270e7dcd2c8829c07b680b108","8061643d1eef4c378a0f42dd7b565d42e16796ad","f48ca02d662fa8201bcd6897514430e5ba6aea22","a904eebbad2c78e319dc7f6530b1b268e167b9f2","afb9c8c8436034509dad6574358c7822911fba93","6b915ac41d87190f523457a073498c58f54f4404","5df4c87c78defaf940a4a70e25bbe0ace316d8d8","5c439eccc7967ac74f31e023e52925809a8b136e","6bd2c1a02896614da0011fc228715511a27fb3c3","5b7511072383814e4aef2cff2ec8662f46da589e","96539d5bb823d94dd86dec8d9c93c4d26a7ebbf6","29bf2e48ae499905bc06ac9e683908c2a7bccdb0","79072e677deed7d40a842b9d51c3325eb71806cf","b2b15072de7406faec354174ce94339bb4f0b55a","73c5680f10275b7d582bb70ada15f4e0b32d890e","f317d3d8a7bf2477993ac044c06d0421a702897a","1a886a25af2240526466e83edeb0b732bb1917b7","89c509e427ca694451195f680edc7b41eb36fcb6","7b5f43ca741d3d9739d5e72544a9ea647c0eee31","4e11bdfcc9b438db63ae01b6da1bdf803f9df14a","920110f9c54f7abc22d96a49fd0bf7c979e3966c","e1ab6fe0e8b53a250b72d0a8a062401ed495aa96","d87e9de7b1646132fb742c591f043c8162f30858","83afdb9af0a0d00c691890c05dee93b3ba432403","2ed68c0e80b45846b9f51f2c7bc1dfb5a21637ae","fff6de7a9f914c619943d0c340a943474ca1c214","eb3f78716ff32cc66f99fa97d130b29cafa1d842","e7d561d66183ade02fbac3de605a09706460e536","08c1849cd881023cbfdb6063700ac7b1549efab9","9667b1efdab32cd5d24354fbed98b3b1bdf21c0c","ffe11df83341a5ad3308729cdf26d0c5965df5c4","daf47e159274c0d8fc04f3a230f3d2e5c608ae3b","95517bcfde89fb174427a7cebff16b9bae806f3a","d6c96b1d73d530551c69f38ec10de662bfd946c0","14d72bd9cb3ca1dd06e6ed1dffb473b077bb92ce","b00a60bbcac802c55c2ab18a2bf3bf9a5eee03c8","40ba38ec83320217abe45e5ff4c66955add94778","649e4cda9ca1f072a303e6ae67d6fa1f2ae26486","34909ffa23f3d9621ac345e4f201abfb2a690900","8eb29701dccba1885a2ece7a9308adb410b0a2bf","0449c447bf97255bc0ba6548f7bcf211a1c08bd2","c93989db36d468be0ba34f856a29ecf86d1f9cdb","6cb5c837ac38fe19d11dec75eb287c2506183cd4","cba4ff5c156dc5087d08e66d7c7aff52c5130b7f","aa05a850b79f7cff2ba92f647b658eb176330ea2","8aa68226acb3142440fd847501adf8341938b27d","caf2d9ea0914e7c283a7b80ced0ead72049d5757","760d771b7f91003381ae27857eab0c475a002cb0","4e80eb4be4be71efbf9528b2791a9e0ea690b164","5c3a659bee2ee15c9983ba7e9c28ffc307f4766c","4ec64e3bfd4d57c08c07d837fc058252370fc479","51a5593c383baf695aaf0f49248c55c828a8b9d5","863b243b80902cafc0a60af65d7723ea91180f0f","492b00c908e63dcbfa9d6b41e599f8b5f2abec06","b3374989beebbe824f586bca4f1164f8f1b6b8f6","cee9a4de9521c2050141f9383d95d5c83ea5add4","d744c6ad2d8a70924725eb66e91cc8b8242e069f","103bb80e4d90cb2142c4ec200131d28a7eb8dc31","13be930f6c1fcf1067b949179704c6be92239389","887cb5395982d32866dbc1f9bf9c9806f9a1af13","0128c485bf2dbd47b975fc9be09b8ef28d0a3a53","878ceb2400b3891d86b63f7701eb0bad0eebac77","2470984d99ed47c40be31a3ad715acdf674d2f45","cb0fbdddf89596832237ef100e8fca0601757f37","30321574b29395061595c2ae62724f7eb9a6d4ce","573a65b080247c209b3c9074f33f5f75664739ff","24a4e423e11a5cfb4d1e7b7827c2c7eb266f6d57","5236cb464f932d8cadc76b51fb08bb2978ce0c86","2801068f231f476486371f7590fce4ee9e804f9d","1e7767d59998fa04f114e669c48cf9c195bfeec4","b5c1cbbd1fd8f6f39b610f8120b902135d59ebd0","0adbe11d864893a998c840dbe1b9ecde5fc9608f","f0eb871883ca3bab804b737107d69b440203b344","2c377e96d88a4175ca65e2597ff40703e098c04d"],"title":"On

There are two different definitions of the two confidence interval method. One of the objectives of this article is to sort out some of the confusion in these two different definitions. In the first definition the two confidence interval method is considered as the fixed margin method that treats a noninferiority margin as a fixed constant after it is determined based on historical data. In this article the method is called the two confidence interval method with fixed margin. The issue of the dependency(ies) of noninferiority test(s) does not occur in this case. In the second definition the two confidence interval method incorporates the uncertainty associated with the estimation for the noninferiority margin. In this article the method is called the two confidence interval method with random margin. The dependency(ies) occurs, because the two confidence interval method(s) with random margin shares the same historical data. In this article we investigate how the dependency(ies) affects the unconditional and conditional across-trial type I error rates.","inCitations":["923f7fe28aa0f76526facb5ed519931c1d8d09d1"],"title":"Strength of evidence of noninferiority trials with the two confidence interval method with random margin.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.616965"}

When the number of outcome categories is relatively large, the sample size is relatively small, and/or certain outcome categories are rare, maximum likelihood can yield biased estimates of the regression parameters. Firth (1993) and Kosmidis and Firth (2009) proposed a procedure to remove the leading term in the asymptotic bias of the maximum likelihood estimator. Their approach is most easily implemented for univariate outcomes. In this paper, we derive a bias correction that exploits the proportionality between Poisson and multinomial likelihoods for multinomial regression models. Specifically, we describe a bias correction for the proportional odds logistic regression model, based on the likelihood from a collection of independent Poisson random variables whose means are constrained to sum to 1, that is straightforward to implement. The proposed method is motivated by a study of predictors of post-operative complications in patients undergoing colon or rectal surgery (Gawande et al., 2007).","inCitations":["9c12eb93951c73c280136515107d350e938ec25c","19d925eb4bd019a8c9490696987675c18946be41"],"title":"Bias correction for the proportional odds logistic regression model with application to a study of surgical complications.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2012.01057.x"}

Viral dynamics models based on nonlinear differential equations have been proposed and well developed over the past few decades. However, it is quite challenging to use experimental or clinical data to estimate the unknown parameters (both constant and time-varying parameters) in complex nonlinear differential equation models. Therefore, investigators usually fix some parameter values, from the literature or by experience, to obtain only parameter estimates of interest from clinical or experimental data. However, when such prior information is not available, it is desirable to determine all the parameter estimates from data. In this paper, we intend to combine the newly developed approaches, a multi-stage smoothing-based (MSSB) method and the spline-enhanced nonlinear least squares (SNLS) approach, to estimate all HIV viral dynamic parameters in a nonlinear differential equation model. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a comparatively thorough procedure, accounting for both efficiency and accuracy, to rigorously estimate all key kinetic parameters in a nonlinear differential equation model of HIV dynamics from clinical data. These parameters include the proliferation rate and death rate of uninfected HIV-targeted cells, the average number of virions produced by an infected cell, and the infection rate which is related to the antiviral treatment effect and is time-varying. To validate the estimation methods, we verified the identifiability of the HIV viral dynamic model and performed simulation studies. We applied the proposed techniques to estimate the key HIV viral dynamic parameters for two individual AIDS patients treated with antiretroviral therapies. We demonstrate that HIV viral dynamics can be well characterized and quantified for individual patients. As a result, personalized treatment decision based on viral dynamic models is possible.","inCitations":["c4db07567534357163ec2731947149648ba6508c","04251bbb6969f6ce814723a79a9b16b8e9625ea5","407e6341f222f63cb0dfa8c36dd090bd1768bee9","ed19ad7754bdb84a26d6ed92a48eed3eef95f32b","cdeeda731c05d7ade60fe4b33e76c717a6a56d3f","95433d6ff8434ee8450d99b26769eaf971b5b1c2","0180b102cab73f3471fc2b197929c290e5985d5c","abc4fa71a4dcd85dc21cb366c9c0bc56e1e1eb05","3d1c44c0df96a4860a75c553dddc55e7faf579ba","4b28eb25438358ac856169e022979d03ae3191b9","c0b873687d8ffc4ed62ecce4f880aae2dee96211","b2a5d5b668198dadf57faee0d20b8ddedac46b1b","1230b75553f8781e108e97f31b5d4ccaa88b3372","d828c5491d8650dcb577547861d95c7e8d0c3698","f696be7376a5f419e8ee55688b1a45b99f87ef15","1623cc2f09bd24f4231c1a32a78e6ad90e5c37cb","15641c334cd4a7a05ecfe4edfc04d1befe92bff4","39ccedd1230a0815602fb4607914428ab5dd5ff9","74d6b3d703fe1b53f8043a9dc153c47f5a1c07a6","de1b80b074535729952a2c67e29bb5eb553f05db","13b26a454b7c5801740f36af7a7c25aaddd2f5dd","73330813b4a8bfd7e7be0285350412563c06c039","a3b0ac072f7edd115af9025dc5eb36d7fd5ccedd","641163f24da6d10102cf9af60ac272e8832bbd52"],"title":"Estimation of Constant and Time-varying Dynamic Parameters of Hiv Infection in a Nonlinear Differential Equation Model.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS290"}

In this paper, an improved Bland-Altman method is proposed to handle more complicated scenarios in practice. This new approach includes Bland-Altman's approach as its special case. We evaluate concordance by defining an agreement interval for each individual paired observation and assessing the overall concordance. The proposed interval approach is very informative and offers many advantages over existing approaches.

We look at various forms of bootstrap tests that use the F statistic to see whether any or all of them maintain the nominal size of the test over a variety of population distributions when the sample size is small. Chernick and LaBudde ( 2010 ) and Schenker ( 1985 ) showed that bootstrap confidence intervals for variances tend to provide considerably less coverage than their theoretical asymptotic coverage for skewed population distributions such as a chi-squared with 10 degrees of freedom or less or a log-normal distribution. The same difficulties may be also be expected when looking at the ratio of two variances. Since bootstrap tests are related to constructing confidence intervals for the ratio of variances, we simulated the performance of these tests when the population distributions are gamma(2,3), uniform(0,1), Student's t distribution with 10 degrees of freedom (df), normal(0,1), and log-normal(0,1) similar to those used in Chernick and LaBudde ( 2010 ). We find, surprisingly, that the results for the size of the tests are valid (reasonably close to the asymptotic value) for all the various bootstrap tests. Hence we also conducted a power comparison, and we find that bootstrap tests appear to have reasonable power for testing equivalence of variances.","inCitations":["a165e4af5153990b874978157c0a5608597691bf","4f0f472532fd7777f68d4112eb7c9ef4aeeef674","b0c8c72ad90ec8b8066c8df6936b06ebea9a7a23"],"title":"A bootstrap test for comparing two variances: simulation of size and power in small samples.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.611082"}

A typical approach is to perform a three-degree of freedom approximate F test of the null hypothesis that the relevant parameters are equal for the two preparations. We argue that this problem may be more appropriately viewed as a practical equivalence testing problem, and present an alternative method for testing parallelism in the four-parameter logistic response curve, based on the theory of intersection-union tests. The approach is intuitively appealing and simple to implement using commonly available software, and may provide more appropriate inference for the problem of interest. Two examples are discussed to illustrate the testing approach outlined in this article, and to compare it with the typical approach to testing parallelism. A simulation study is also presented to compare the empirical properties of the two different testing approaches for a set of cases based approximately on one of the examples.","inCitations":["955ec0c5e6cca14f54c327c4250c034be8b35ee9","ed0c68b9f8fff76ac01e245475d87f6ae0d7183a","b393fa9b957770b0c44dca8aeb7e2566e31ad4d0","f27ffd9b345ee1b8fb6977798b4f6ce8f54bb656","cc3887100d94b52815edf58e3be8214debd3ebc4"],"title":"Equivalence testing for parallelism in the four-parameter logistic model.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903105299"}

Starting from a consistent Bayesian hierarchical model for the mean treatment effects, we represent the variance configuration by a set of triangle inequalities on the standard deviations. We take the separation strategy (Barnard and others, 2000) to specify prior distributions for standard deviations and correlations separately. The covariance matrix of the latent treatment arm effects can be employed as a vehicle to load the triangular constraints, which in addition allows incorporation of prior beliefs about the correlations between treatment effects. The spherical parameterization based on Cholesky decomposition (Pinheiro and Bates, 1996) is used to generate a positive-definite matrix for the prior correlations in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Elicited prior information on correlations between treatment arms is introduced in the form of its equivalent data likelihood. The procedure is implemented in a MCMC framework and illustrated with example data sets from medical research practice.","inCitations":["6c1731d0afeab8221f96a97923801d561b775106","0c84921b639c7b1cb2f9c4a9126a26ec1fe3f698","10634282fab6ab006717d121c3afd1d32363eabd","49c8b2329a1489a2edf6e35069fa1363ae98df52","6b32aab51a72eb02598e1dccd041d57ae5df63a7","c3de3fd05f107a28a984b9b584873113bf4aebee","43073f440025e610f80f0b5a28dd9a6b8437b773","14b094ad014bf78d05c80e1fd0c07c5ee7c39090","d5cd78f4c6363dd68e1532db65d44665cad618f6","b16191050b16130b8bfa8c2ee98bda3395b9fdf6","12124eb7c8a1f08ba8d881de4e80086d50d6c1f7","965c16335482be707ce69e168c3b87cfc58be626","abd66592bdc948b8382cf0b8fd7a1fb7caeaee63","f0e295f62ace240333bda19cd5684183e255058d","94bec09e6c40b49a636f9e41d4c0848be85ef396","84b155dee5b09adb0f260bcdded032b916f89b86","c2faa3c94a23aad23471a0b3a2cdd1f5c1d402df","081e3289fa1eae31b7fe293f1b24cd8359e5d7aa","81897ea97fd9a285cb3229433585a9713aaf7419","ab621249893faf853d6b432f663518abfe48053c","687dc97c2f524aca3de109cc4e33fd761eb121a9","5ec6dddff8f7f2396f2aade4029f875faf4f3eab","aa32afdc51e33e6cbd8094c64f87d92501258492","9b532ffbb4953f3794d6ad55e95e6929bffe2e4d","c72c5a00952b53efdb446b2f8bc705bb45ec679e","063cc6ef7e7b9732998c92988491a29cc0f7741e","ed07bbc1fa59c9666d323758c6211d893e21ceb1","e0d890ff21b87e640bd5d3ced061b3c707c59cb0","118abc42636040ea240d4285d482e49a4544fa6c","d09afd813509cb6a459c3e7910ef18ace6e53d02","5a3c19f9f2a50dce244ece8903463aa0b3cd9464","7ce718bad816fbd71829a5e5708eb1bd17acd433","31741a64209ad95afd20aa7a202c0694e45b4667","31bbffa32b9fc7bd5f7cbbb6d8c8eeed4bbdfb54","3ce1bdb5a291c981f0690829909ffe0ebd90bd09","a95a44e719f8ed1990f6590a17a08597c9576e5e","a328cd891a0d75adcf46d7a8f78d84e946507143","0c12d4cb36fd6cf5a7edc093171221ea16910cf9","bef40a474cc46d5d1f6fef39680f3712fa19754d","c5bb63ef355095a2d38f0a7a0818972e70390cd5","40e24b1e8dc8e8bda5aad52abceb6552048c3ff1","06cc20d81ed84a19d8f75578a66e2a4b772bd7f6","8a5a938a365f9878f2dc9d53a21b1dc628bc9b39","578e4738450ec880eaf9024a89206814457e1d00","c1890b48051e42d4a960e349ea4c18cd3693efba","d7142ddfe3c5f435df0bad2b32ef685893bd3430","67a22b71f06d3eea5689642a3b2da13582dcf90b","6e97a2489ff8b7b42525841d197384509ff4a983","8efca06db6e379d3233b8053e5c766f3dea806c9","0b0b5c8efacc650bfe08c3188901bac315b19335","e8c576543cb5ef089ae2d263f61816e6ce04caf9","364746bebd6b3fa4a12839a403647946635e39f9","57e7b0e1e604fd71eaf44d94c0f0efaa3318209c","487e62286db887160a1ae04faf7cf8bb316b98c2","584df43bf0440dac22d2b7dc26c0ccfd4de1e74d","a736e5120a1bf9d43c5adfff6bf3f7b8c4e5868c","bd4e6c7fa843202e79733a656c594db9b9b1291b","207640856d298423810c17fa1a77551c59da8828","3b9625a02c471d80946a0bb82bc685bdc5ffff6c","04c85194fa00579a03baca7ab593ebc509f9fd7c","1364787744da92ad14029ef40950383c553d6a69","fa2e6e5eda672455b1b3638cb7469b4b3d5c1ccc","9643ef69ce250a089451c3c076e426a2e56a3557","5ba1c4c1b7c8bdf60301b35da55afb6749b75ae7","0304f089ee72071bff46a76b4b12debcce8acc24","7398d8ac63a74360364d81fa65ab8850cf731039","f8f77b1ebcfa69d7a8c5a6599db1da90c6e30b98","8006bf04b4b78a1ad225843ddee0ca26363a30d0","817cc203799429274f8c7d04fa5f4d2ebbd69e33","9c6bfc4c4033d5f4f24ce118404f11f8d31700b9","19a82276d6dc9f95ea7d6bfa5dd0a68edf139c2d","4010a87284e9fa18fc8627a5882f60b256700bcf","c89bc2a01b6d38b1916534943d185150ce53aef5","bc298fc65c49c4cb06f9be1e4eeb7b7012693143","e8f6f61744624d035eb41717a5c1b202ff9b64c8","3cb254bd0e3bc1db1b90c77a5c5e8e52ed3f5bfb","ffa5a394e04da99dfbe8155caeb3fab01e7beeba","7a2e0ee6dfc0bd3787a41bf52a124d070115c561","29cd4ca17bfcbd5a858db829698a141b071cd3b2","3190c7f89fc0acd55f09d565951e9330132bf9a3","a1baecd916f1e12da3fb11720cbb0d442f8c2228","a1a5e781c8f4f95dcdb65fb144c6196410a61965","451172b130645d8b36d7082b474dfe9942439c10","bc1862fc85e3b56f53b63a7b48ae3ebe15e6e2e5","d7228dfcba550f61d38c48e20ee2411f1869c035","8e17666b6136bc236d3bd84466123dde3cd2beac","f6c763a4ab36e19c89b7ae5706cca83c8c6f76a5","e88a52c2a801e9ed8964c6f983ffc3b21f45db1c","d1e6869cddaeb9b4c50d6f31514b60e51b046c75"],"title":"Modeling between-trial variance structure in mixed treatment comparisons.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp032"}

The tests are based on the pairwise distances across subjects within each subset of the response. A complete graph is induced by each subset of response coordinates, with the sample points as nodes and the pairwise distances as the edge weights. The proposed test statistic depends only on the rank order of edges in these complete graphs. The response vector may be of any dimensions. In particular, the number of samples may be smaller than the dimensions of the response. The test statistic is shown to have a normal limiting distribution with known expectation and variance under the null hypothesis of independence. The exact distribution free null distribution of the test statistic is given for a sample of size 14, and its Monte-Carlo approximation is considered for larger sample sizes. We demonstrate in simulations that this new class of tests has good power properties for very general alternatives.","inCitations":["e22273f9b1329ba6f0c794fc225ad43e3981ca76","4b46030442bc79c632ceed776cf67bbfd28c8414","11a922db5d2fabe356f8fa587818d2a1f8392dee","bffb23af543fc65f440f2c48a49576260ad60fd4","418edef7f531aa124e98e248cdb1d3c89966d2c9"],"title":"A class of multivariate distribution-free tests of independence based on graphs.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2012.06.003"}

We present the analytic expressions for the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for several commonly used frailty distributions. Furthermore, we develop a time-dependent CCC for measuring agreement between survival times among subjects who survive beyond a specified time point. We characterize the temporal pattern in the time-dependent CCC for various frailty distributions.

We perform a variety of simulation studies in order to illustrate the strong performance of our approach. The coverage probabilities of our CIs in the one-sample setting are superior than or comparable to other well-known approaches. The true utility of our new and novel approach is in the two-sample setting. For the difference of two proportions, our smooth bootstrap CIs provide better coverage probabilities almost uniformly over the interval (-1, 1), particularly in the tail region as compared than other published methods included in our simulation.
