However, alternative solutions are needed to increase power in small microarray experiments. Use of traditional parametric and even non-parametric tests for such small experiments lack power and have distributional problems. A mixture model is described that is performed directly on expression differences assuming that genes in alternative treatments are expressed or not in all combinations (i) not expressed in either condition, (ii) expressed only under the first condition, (iii) expressed only under the second condition, and (iv) expressed under both conditions, giving rise to 4 possible clusters with two treatments. The approach is termed a Mean-Difference-Mixture-Model (MD-MM) method. Accuracy and power of the MD-MM was compared to other commonly used methods, using both simulations, microarray data, and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The MD-MM was found to be generally superior to other methods in most situations. The advantage was greatest in situations where there were few replicates, poor signal to noise ratios, or non-homogenous variances.","inCitations":["7fc1fac844586ce95de85c1275f258e842514a97","cee74e7645674064f59e3e2c14f922fa65b85292","017b21fc910bdcacd71f5d87c20b3b82619b98e3","459ae9fc5b7ff2fd4ad455546400b251812e846b","9339111f4c1f4df1230d7e866e7df9b1d05dd02c"],"title":"A mixture model approach for the analysis of small exploratory microarray experiments","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.06.011"}

Assume that the schedule of a screening program is periodic and that the sojourn time in the preclinical state has a piecewise density function. Modeling the preclinical sojourn time distribution as a piecewise density function results in robust estimation of the distribution function. Our aim is to estimate the piecewise density function and the examination sensitivity using both generalized least squares and maximum likelihood methods. We carried out extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the methods of estimation. The different estimation methods provide complimentary tools to obtain the unknown parameters. The methods are applied to three breast cancer early-detection trials.","inCitations":["ccc34544eca22371e2d6b43f00a372206911538e","19000590651226e5f8aae422c41ef24422da618c","71399adc30ba6b5ba70173b323a9676fe798c323","2177b7c0f9bb6e15b7b7b341cdf67def4b344a13","1a3d191049d86b4bb371a6ba3ebf84d482704688","36967863c12a62cfc506cf8492c844221bbc0857","41e401e23c5b2ccf1e29bff69a2fb035f0a615c2","5b24d13bd348379399de38fedc250db67d737f13","24e13316b5e2b3ac012c912f38d169c6a7c65aef","56ceeddd24f7dae218b6d310e846642ae9f9f631","572810df18d2b4673b9ae9c50d8f750254687b30","196f9bb70e1991519a65e8cb597fbdf2206135cb","59855f46bc4b37cbef8c897ea1ba222606e5842f","e3660c7c39208cc38bef97cb0fea6f1345b64f1c","872db845b8d3268a63253a2a1793ce8ed7ae9a4a","346e4ad0e7e45cc575ff0f8cf7a8c07dda772d1a","eb2ec093fa9a3f2894df170aabff41fe53377ab6","d0f314332c498e6415b45e96ff4e5473587ce451","28fdb63f0ada8975a636bdfa9afe115c9c51a886"],"title":"Robust modeling in screening studies: estimation of sensitivity and preclinical sojourn time distribution.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi030"}

If an independent data set were available, the parameters of interest could be estimated by using standard inference methods to fit the postulated marginal model to the independent data set. However, when applied to the same data set used by the variable selector, standard (\"naive\") methods can lead to distorted inferences. The authors develop testing and interval estimation methods for parameters reflecting the marginal association between the selected covariates and response variable, based on the same data set used for variable selection. They provide theoretical justification for the proposed methods, present results to guide their implementation, and use simulations to assess and compare their performance to a sample-splitting approach. The methods are illustrated with data from a recent AIDS study.","inCitations":["603fbdc67e94a0c3d8a308bb1ef80072dffe63ce","44bea0ef802ee0803a755eb01aca1cb65e3cd207","568041132ef83e8e80094fba4da477f440168c22","de15d2d492da816a9dc71b5e05eb095947dd4848","3165ce9ae9530f0206bab9ca6d2a0ada14094526","c7c9f50424bd52c592ec307224e8b3ed5cee2768"],"title":"Inference after variable selection using restricted permutation methods.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.10039"}

The proposed method can be used to handle a variety of continuous and discrete outcomes. A test built on this approach is also developed for model simplification in order to improve efficiency. Simulations are carried out to compare the proposed estimation procedure with other methods.

Computational statistics","paperAbstract":"Cluster analysis methods seek to partition a data set into homogeneous subgroups. It is useful in a wide variety of applications, including document processing and modern genetics. Conventional clustering methods are unsupervised, meaning that there is no outcome variable nor is anything known about the relationship between the observations in the data set. In many situations, however, information about the clusters is available in addition to the values of the features. For example, the cluster labels of some observations may be known, or certain observations may be known to belong to the same cluster. In other cases, one may wish to identify clusters that are associated with a particular outcome variable. This review describes several clustering algorithms (known as \"semi-supervised clustering\" methods) that can be applied in these situations. The majority of these methods are modifications of the popular k-means clustering method, and several of them will be described in detail. A brief description of some other semi-supervised clustering algorithms is also provided.","inCitations":["327b5a13e62406e69e7fe447e368e6626449b545","219330dcd5ba1bac8c9f693dc4c8e07eb8a29a81","91b7b487c2dc523fdf152690425c1955613c504c","55852abe71181f3f5e454df8032193af8746317a","a8cdc41109b71e8b85e627aeef54fb109ee25077","57d56b8197204405aabf31a64305228901773958","76ebac7c98ccbd595d4954686b099c5e45c0d1c6","9343d0794db9f3eda350492c188a2a77edc0d11b","a7a166aa6f733d7e40e32096aaaec95a5e507c34","f6c195c8d7eb1db5a873f7620121d0b16059e2f9","add459d9d37743dc2baad703fe17f794cb6b5d3f","a134b30f013617b3c99f7412b83996b8d1b42625","bdc3de97bf65a801dbf54bf7d5f73a242bcab0b1","6607f7546e15dfab597303c8288ba92ecef973cf","f72535bca9d1122ae1f977fc1b061c15551b059c","17e7bcef3b5487a8b53d52cf422ca5e10c1d73eb","484c733d15e6c4cb1300643af5d294d2355e7a11","39adc5f48e52c437696df21eb7d77ffe6a1de18d","9f95312e39d37731b44621129f4b62ad64b6d912","8d5459b4afc763a0348b5bec1155823d34204f3f","5c90d8fa6155ec0a756250d6d0f9aeeac76b4d3c","5d325485a7d9d2f4e99905e408ce90de6875e1a8","eebc609cd357788e54f3b264c61f2e3d16669666","0058cbe110933f73c21fa6cc9ae0cd23e974a9c7","a338daadf10943237effe2742958ac4d314e2399","ab34c35db2a37f5c2ee461f863037673e55f5889","7c1186883b630b155e3b5e0a474d31ef8f64e366","fce9558bae35d0a8b7ac625924a017730db240ee","9a374b6b58ee3f112dff3f078c1bbef61a261c79","390c92f07761b6856d2de4072e69b6e916785b05","cd2e5769b4914a92551d926bfc4cacc0f9a85081","f0bc091a7a5d71383b8d94d616136c8c0bbf2980","2d1f26a90e2a2fc1b8f96c459b3213d0f29eb3ce","e9a6f278aeac878dd805646987ec399269eebf8e","7cff8149ce772d53998b19c30274f5475a108b17","4096bcf05731a107a41dfc38abf20c93d161f27e","8c61fc8abe011637e64e29c83be3af245ff52788","57f8ce3cfb50f9c727095de3ca19da0c22355608","219f235e1243a80a57ed465d7c72b7cfe45e3bf6","0997d0772faab7f6479d731a1e3fe9843f4b6a41","8cf2838df9c0b68aa08388790e5c591f13e02f0e","05cbdbbf46be3c57d2db13877b36baa0f8ece1f1","4b237fe311361b4c5af2786c0131d3235f2f4cbc","25a0402f6e691ee3866e0816ac181c93f38997ba","cad3224883adceaea2e7265870cf550ba1d778ee","bb8f6b6e5d277a82b77115156a4b2bab56a47784","3021b6dec80e7032fd995c0dcadf4c992b7d7506"],"title":"Semi-supervised clustering methods","doi":"10.1002/wics.1270"}

It requires a major undertaking on breakthrough strategies and methodology for designs to minimize sample sizes and to shorten duration of the development. We propose an alternative phase II/III design based on continuous efficacy endpoints, which consists of two stages: a selection stage and a confirmation stage. For the selection stage, a randomized parallel design with several doses with a placebo group is employed for selection of doses. After the best dose is chosen, the patients of the selected dose group and placebo group continue to enter the confirmation stage. New patients will also be recruited and randomized to receive the selected dose or placebo group. The final analysis is performed with the cumulative data of patients from both stages. With the pre-specified probabilities of rejecting the drug at each stage, sample sizes and critical values for both stages can be determined. As it is a single trial with controlling overall type I and II error rates, the proposed phase II/III adaptive design may not only reduce the sample size but also improve the success rate. An example illustrates the applications of the proposed phase II/III adaptive design.","inCitations":["706de60030ee5d38da2cf99b98269ed50721896f","f3da1413a7101395d71f24c02d54ba1e78b0a254","dc17509a897b3dfe62731527caf6b461d5a23246","96e4f5aa6a7008d2a0b06269a7fc34fd644b78fb"],"title":"An alternative phase II/III design for continuous endpoints.","doi":"10.1002/pst.418"}

To gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of this effect, researchers may be interested in exploring whether or not it runs through a specific intermediate variable: the mediator. Mediation analysis in crossover designs has received scant attention so far and is mostly confined to the traditional Baron and Kenny approach. We aim to tackle mediation analysis within the counterfactual framework and elucidate the assumptions under which the direct and indirect effects can be identified in AB/BA crossover studies. Notably, we show that both effects are identifiable in certain statistical models, even in the presence of unmeasured time-independent (or upper-level) confounding of the mediator–outcome relation. Employing the mediation formula, we derive expressions for the direct and indirect effects in within-subject designs for continuous outcomes that lend themselves to linear modelling, under a large variety of settings. We discuss an estimation approach based on regressing differences in outcomes on differences in mediators and show how to allow for period effects as well as different types of moderation. The performance of this approach is compared to other existing methods through simulations and is illustrated with data from a neurobehavioural study. Lastly, we demonstrate how a sensitivity analysis can be performed that is able to assess the robustness of both the direct and indirect effect against violation of the “no unmeasured lower-level mediator–outcome confounding” assumption.","inCitations":["4452cc53983a567e0ee0cd5653e2c57aac46152a","90c8f8daeb503574a86d078bf2c682dc3739eff9","8019fd70a723ff127125bb36c494712a631b7eb8"],"title":"Within-Subject Mediation Analysis in AB/BA Crossover Designs","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2014-0057"}

The traditional approach is to control the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis, the familywise error rate (FWE). To improve the power of detecting treatment differences, an alternative approach is to control the expected proportion of errors among the rejected hypotheses, the false discovery rate (FDR). When some of the hypotheses are not true, the error rate from either the FWE- or the FDR-controlling procedure is usually lower than the designed level. This paper compares five methods used to estimate the number of true null hypotheses over a large number of hypotheses. The estimated number of true null hypotheses is then used to improve the power of FWE- or FDR-controlling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of these methods. The lowest slope method, developed by Benjamini and Hochberg (2000) on the adaptive control of the FDR in multiple testing with independent statistics, and the mean of differences method appear to perform the best. These two methods control the FWE properly when the number of nontrue null hypotheses is small. A data set from a toxicogenomic microarray experiment is used for illustration.","inCitations":["04c77eb8113bca89594e7c29a217e7b239d8952e","1ef83b2b980b406db708adb6104533be05af9854","d3950396051b4b7dee4d5d9f3c10191f9e5c8b8f","ed7d2b49b7fb728e9fbbc15c048a30a0623cd68e","f136a8167e2627dc0347b05466744f2f5935eee3","56f76d7b283fad276eaeaf5a86b3516cbf8c3e68","949225972b308425359ce046d5418c914288f66a","628f62241eb3b9b99cc424095f55ed15f98c5478","f1e7570781fba2ac576049f589308fcf794ec768","b51839a995c62f0283ab1a1c6c185d13a092f7b2","03428a22201ae7eb1df627e509b2fcc0df1b18e9","eab669a51f7a7321092998cc79150d306d708647","2c4c300672ea8634f4714432cbd54d9f3f9d37b4","1c796e57afdadaadf935b0031c327a4158fca3d9","522a22f15190643e99bdd4a14357665443216260","3e9a554c9b5e4396e583d0695d4ff33b03e532c5","c9be3c6a8e182f1e6c710de8e4a03b1b892f41fb","25ae3fb1f01414577a301e3021d7fad05d550345","6907ced8b2b02e60582537ff9727103b5aed7bd1","c1fb5cbe9a010820e9ed79427ffae1198eee808f","0062a39e5b3d0659788d37b123f4d2d2c5ead412","96ef799148b63e2f4399cb454b1dd1b0c6836c3d","d46cb66d6ea4ede69758ca1641708473858ab125","0d04d5101a308f961946f6adece668ed05beab32","4d0e428a0bec04d2c711e3588b3ab83ef85b1aef","8cf12905d7d704bf22b7d3618743817591243466","7aeace2306487c5e5f3ff6711e1a5d3fc1e4c899","604ee9ce5a7daa35020171b80b23f82eb7b3378a","d62a394db31665005df761959f6f56b06048c6aa","7e8b9a9b5922e5f948f2e4c935afd19779c804e3","d419a92e68596f68fae410c1d96bbff453b1ea19","31599dd445bb4ed5039bc12d58d653ac5e37e28a","9f859afeaa8f3d62345217e102c965613b69edd4","e028ba1ebb93627731de80adae9a6dc44e7b6557","6bfe9d3321e4163a6b40b33fd9f9b6305c19b0f8","126e3c4d73150f3497733f5bf58e0718960c7f39","395736e43dec0d6e9927ff4c104d1bb19ef0841f","0f96c5403f1d1a81e3fafb09363807757e59b8fe","42b96ac69d45782d141bcf1395901249f8d08b47","b69804dfb97df175f6e4bf61b89fd9767283e6b6","b9c33773da6837f4d1db99c027ff33087f99e093","a6cae558a4410123e3e827f6c4a79fbf647e1a2d","7d152d02732a6dbe5b65b2a9c3bc9e3529c0193a","66bc5f9640ce69c3c992a7a0d6cf74ca64d8592a","05c82a1de2705388dc1343dd3f765b8e32c37ba2","5cd42d3de2acd5a92b2d5de01b9405ee02ec78aa","5d57c4f772ad145f6ee30b9e4d5f1a1c118f70dd","c960f74e75298f497224f5c2374b49bcb4ae9b85","1914398448fcf52b288bee0745307938a6f06294","8d3a7b10e7de6cc24934ad963fbe15d6e12ac003"],"title":"Comparison of methods for estimating the number of true null hypotheses in multiplicity testing.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120024202"}

There are myriad sources of uncertainty in microarray experiments, and rigorous experimental design is essential for fully realizing the potential of these valuable resources. Two questions frequently asked by biologists on the brink of conducting cDNA or two-colour, spotted microarray experiments are 'Which mRNA samples should be competitively hybridized together on the same slide?' and 'How many times should each slide be replicated?' Early experience has shown that whilst the field of classical experimental design has much to offer this emerging multi-disciplinary area, new approaches which accommodate features specific to the microarray context are needed. In this paper, we propose optimal designs for factorial and time course experiments, which are special designs arising quite frequently in microarray experimentation. Our criterion for optimality is statistical efficiency based on a new notion of admissible designs; our approach enables efficient designs to be selected subject to the information available on the effects of most interest to biologists, the number of arrays available for the experiment, and other resource or practical constraints, including limitations on the amount of mRNA probe. We show that our designs are superior to both the popular reference designs, which are highly inefficient, and to designs incorporating all possible direct pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our proposed designs represent a substantial practical improvement over classical experimental designs which work in terms of standard interactions and main effects. The latter do not provide a basis for meaningful inference on the effects of most interest to biologists, nor make the most efficient use of valuable and limited resources.","inCitations":["732a80947eb949eee0399930d32899c044529ca3","cbc145adb6b45ef18eccf7d222303be91b10777d","fa6d42bc6c1958cbcbbe2588b93d5f77c97ecc4c","3ddd2be141e5f45dc725a96b6ae7bad9cf3bc34f","949568b3513d424680a7fa934737716dbfbd8eda","de452feac9df522cff28a13f66892e3b1e3e1298","4bcaaedb0486743c6c3abc8897c43d1aad730352","b504e4385c931b7bfec93ee68cc35ee92b2a92e5","ee3c4b0c9551fb6bf76b340120d2ec19bf5531f0","5ebdb6c54c2391b28738c9620351d57ff70dd13b","e09ef8608282fe453a88ad5d8cb7fe0250064148","6af3bb401e69990f0c18da9815470374e7161cef","5d8c9e1fa6ada33ac192a9bf239c182d36e3a756","d612e81fa3279b7a7887970a3e3b8f8f0d22b060","1c878934d830ded259f5f100591a49ad1b893bc9","586d52c0c99b37f0751ff5bde68cd5c35cde52e6","bb7a0f25385e18829feeeab1f1b7dccac7306e8e","58c1a47fa1702007fcd257ec0d5f62c7fea55275","2c493f00e186affee97ec341a004da8638e4c503","c43113f4424fdb2b7ef88e5ddd98ca8989846103","bd795829cb54d10e2e74e6d65a3fd12c63d326b5","8f222aca3a6555b656ee132ac3aa11bee5a65d8a","fa167e80915dba5e26f19e6f82423a2be223f5e9","72a72df8ef3dd944be92c52c0ff81482ee8b1249","ce993b2030489430f798a60456910de4d7ff0612","62597fdef42f25f7e977b379cb8653561e7aaabf","6ffa4d7604308d4c02dd98e0a08ec842096fdc8e","f71be1544a4892929c700d31858e1691ec69b68c","89a594ecacbf6c148b26a880cd892e7b6b69a1d7","038c2d9a4f94760ee450334278dd33ad4f712698","0bf87dc4f9c8ae39a01ae941683809dbda33f661","8fa3d3dfec0ea88ee70fb609cd6f0dd44c9a0b88","7ab1409b8094af264b475230fccf37f447e11822","c0b7849bce0572f4f57edff8670bbd08bc73cfa1","86b22a974a715fe82c7c5429230f7dfa4f9a8070","326df6b6e8db9376eaa7284e6e752faf6c0855f6","19c3c29a2fc70d24d2f25e16cf796d65e8e7f889","283f478b76f0e3dc04b15bd8a9eea1987492b6c5","7b47cc8c7570bd0d70b7ac58a9348dcb1d4a2c88","d2527481fbf183b495352008c21beb663db39b13","21f17758de94af264cde14313cb9327065926c62","97fdee98907f0a10f37232e29642063831b21b37","82a15dc8b5be5955858a06edaf9e6e3ca35ffb5b","03546fe0fb1a6087165b8d8af6ace435a58dd43a","5f21fc230767f31f15fb54db4b7b947b2a722ba7","a411584e230308c1c8d834a420e14d6ac4434a8d","5d64b5b72f54333222068ba73cee085330872674","2c7f89c60c318c065bdab97f68d340584e59acd4","60c35f4d0410c317977e1106ea8017ebbed30206","d6cdeb90b29c0078746df1f96fec2d89ad1bd76f","b97db678a484cd745a71527fd0a38400f7b02b78","6562ef3135d9eec7c55fef0b58a1d2e5d1e1033c","4c5a6b0a3fda340b9aa720b7b31ca58e79ee8ea6","9f20c71a65b2925dfb80cbaaeb6e37d6ee4d4ab1","70493b02a33bfa855715268b1d962ee960a1259a","d8e6b2fdf9046bde56f8fa0130efe7b434a3a1b5","58a972fbf1c544c867e150bf05679fe9610549b6","b5e1f5c495de180d372393805d964a588989f9d0","15715efa75d3c53ff253af92b5fa82ba5ecad109","2d7805507953ed3af628401685c3f217850572c6","2dec3b5b5a58f48d694e5bb30f9e7387842398a7","66ee3ec55527f641799e7d98bb930164af5d55be","35a3cb09f0302316ae0e5f3ef30ffecf86d83d88","eb881f66b01f49161a209b53911cb39a5347f25e","320ba80cd27ae159dd53bea424fe763b9a0ba8ca","217649be8b98e895bb56fa4abb4ffc5c7452e0da"],"title":"Factorial and time course designs for cDNA microarray experiments.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.1.89"}

We develop a framework for using data to inform these decisions in realtime. We formalize a treatment allocation strategy as a sequence of functions, one per treatment period, that map up-to-date information on the spread of an infectious disease to a subset of locations where treatment should be allocated. An optimal allocation strategy optimizes some cumulative outcome, e.g. the number of uninfected locations, the geographic footprint of the disease or the cost of the epidemic. Estimation of an optimal allocation strategy for an emerging infectious disease is challenging because spatial proximity induces interference between locations, the number of possible allocations is exponential in the number of locations, and because disease dynamics and intervention effectiveness are unknown at out-break. We derive a Bayesian on-line estimator of the optimal allocation strategy that combines simulation-optimization with Thompson sampling. The estimator proposed performs favourably in simulation experiments. This work is motivated by and illustrated using data on the spread of white nose syndrome, which is a highly fatal infectious disease devastating bat populations in North America.","inCitations":["1001ca294f6a9124aa548b532bc3bc550964635a","b842fdfd2427c3adf2f2cdd5288506ba218c1e65","0837365f6416be9e167638de38fc246c6b0cd5eb","352209ec89587205c64411bcfddf837f428e3eba","8cdcfd333961b3209e05de5ed8a48741a878ae16","396b6798341e46cd8553cfc799b78c17391caa47"],"title":"Optimal treatment allocations in space and time for on-line control of an emerging infectious disease.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12266"}

In many situations, all covariates are measured on the entire study cohort. However, in some scenarios the primary covariates are time dependent yet may be ascertained retrospectively after completion of the study. One common example would be covariate measurements based on stored biological specimens such as blood plasma. While authors have previously proposed generalizations of the standard case-control design in which the clustered outcome measurements are used to selectively ascertain covariates (Neuhaus and Jewell, 1990) and therefore provide resource efficient collection of information, these designs do not appear to be commonly used. One potential barrier to the use of longitudinal outcome-dependent sampling designs would be the lack of a flexible class of likelihood-based analysis methods. With the relatively recent development of flexible and practical methods such as generalized linear mixed models (Breslow and Clayton, 1993) and marginalized models for categorical longitudinal data (see Heagerty and Zeger, 2000, for an overview), the class of likelihood-based methods is now sufficiently well developed to capture the major forms of longitudinal correlation found in biomedical repeated measures data. Therefore, the goal of this manuscript is to promote the consideration of outcome-dependent longitudinal sampling designs and to both outline and evaluate the basic conditional likelihood analysis allowing for valid statistical inference.","inCitations":["83b2cba3a38cbb27158214a6664168c023b0bce4","14cfdc4f77b84610e5a1112a596033e318c2f845","3a59bb107fc705f1d06f7299fb1f6cb2fd67e486","41af5c14c98c6d67f54994b4c838296dda4e3a57","f512e4da7c62eae45117884369de020e802fb754","0fd3a19e18c52042a52a4bce9f0fb9c3b0a19886","a3c8d5676781030c056588c9e963bd9874d115a4","a51bd4e4e1c93a76c1ea3a456c9564e019f6c123","50f6c9df4c1136a287ba9846187cc1a138c918a9","7efd60c6b7458d6087d062e25b06f6ead84b4c2c","444bc59a698aae309b7f19de49c09757b02c8713","f92f5ec14d15933a940a8786c8267846e6f35e48","b44ca1d8c3ffb37ad65c2f80b2bbfa8c15876e46","f9cff488d02f3744e96741b8c0d757ce19ade0cb"],"title":"On outcome-dependent sampling designs for longitudinal binary response data with time-varying covariates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn006"}

However, the following four issues may be critical in longitudinal data analysis. (i) A homogeneous population assumption for models may be unrealistically obscuring important features of between-subject and within-subject variations; (ii) normality assumption for model errors may not always give robust and reliable results, in particular, if the data exhibit skewness; (iii) the responses may be missing and the missingness may be nonignorable; and (iv) some covariates of interest may often be measured with substantial errors. When carrying out statistical inference in such settings, it is important to account for the effects of these data features; otherwise, erroneous or even misleading results may be produced. Inferential procedures can be complicated dramatically when these four data features arise. In this article, the Bayesian joint modeling approach based on a finite mixture of NLME joint models with skew distributions is developed to study simultaneous impact of these four data features, allowing estimates of both model parameters and class membership probabilities at population and individual levels. A real data example is analyzed to demonstrate the proposed methodologies, and to compare various scenarios-based potential models with different specifications of distributions.","inCitations":["d79e1ecc3b689c443568d30ee439291740572785"],"title":"A mixture of hierarchical joint models for longitudinal data with heterogeneity, non-normality, missingness, and covariate measurement error.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.1000547"}

We consider two scenarios involving binary exposure X, covariate Z and outcome Y. In the first, Z is not affected by X, and is a potential confounder of the causal effect of X on Y. In the second, Z is affected by X and intermediate in the causal pathway between X and Y. For each scenario we consider various linear constraints corresponding to the presence or absence of arcs in the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG), monotonicity assumptions, and presence or absence of additive-scale interactions. We also estimate Z-stratum-specific bounds when Z is a potential effect measure modifier and bounds for both controlled and natural direct effects when Z is affected by X. In the absence of any additional constraints deriving from background knowledge, the well-known bounds on RDc are duplicated: -Pr(Y not equalX) <\/= RD(C) <\/= Pr(Y=X). These bounds have unit width, but can be narrowed by background knowledge-based assumptions. We provide and compare bounds and bound widths for various combinations of assumptions in the two scenarios and apply these bounds to real data from two studies.","inCitations":["78d6cf71f20ca359680175369fb755be8c218de4","bc7245bc88d7004120d8c2224d24025635653f67","9cebaa4ad91b84ae3e1edc1350d9719b594e42fd","7e64d163dcb3b5d3a1167280c5a05415a5219c4b","6050109f158775408aa6b44caeb2bf6efb9a39f3","b58c9365c768d6b4504d6e38f03e2278c65d745f","40e00c944ca01028aee3d6741d06869fd5a17f09","e3b3806100853dbe8e85da9362624d852cb1b4f6","5125af4f64ce7f490ea8b306cddbe62dea21b48a","eb59cf7717b6db35f54ad5b06e909c7d15e88dc1","5b2dea65c09d0e6e557c4052df322b0c9772bf14","a01cd51416397d488d7f1a45816750dbb20894fb","e23eb0f0ba5d2849302d9b9264696c390fd3c153","c712e92c775141c076b21b4b1b546eb6142804b0","0c9b91da73d83a77959090251daee7c531140225","83e3e930f249f960a4456a73dd4331c22b886bfd","d4441ddecb244e2c30307d19fceba4117ce95da6","68fdf32ee67c0a8f4945e06b4df35733e017a50c","d6d5adcfd80dae47d86579ab03dd22b2a0701160","793d675269f5def7f3fec81f0c4f30228285405b","4c05f821ce566a82a776c1b2b61512a892fbdf13","c3ade5ca2ba2181d950860e617c16028869d0595","07c6d718af582037c7701c11040b2b34903dce24","9c352afd2f0cebc84a9eef9ab63e8ecfe0e0bdd2","8a4ee771a0def05d857f7423972f657add339185"],"title":"Analytic Bounds on Causal Risk Differences in Directed Acyclic Graphs Involving Three Observed Binary Variables.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2009.03.024"}

Functional data analysis provides a tool to separate these two sources of variation (registration) and differentiates between the variation in maturational tempo (temporal, or phase variation) and the variation in height (amplitude variation). We extended this concept by combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Maximum Likelihood Principle. Longitudinal data on height were obtained from two large growth studies from Lublin, Poland, and Zurich, Switzerland, with altogether 361 children. Variation in amplitude monotonically rises with age; variation in phase peaks during puberty. During mid-puberty, phase variation is large and explains up to 40 percent of total height variance in girls, and up to 50 percent in boys. Eight amplitude and 4 phase components appeared biologically significant. The largest amplitude component explained 91% of the amplitude variance and is characterised by an almost horizontal pattern. The largest phase component explained 66% (boys) and 63% (girls) of phase variance, rises throughout childhood and reaches up to 0.85 years in adolescent boys, and up to 0.75 years in adolescent girls. Phase components significantly correlated with the clinical signs of puberty. The combination of PCA and the Maximum Likelihood Principle provides a new, powerful and automatic tool for growth modelling that includes estimates of future growth, adult stature and developmental tempo. Preliminary results indicate that this approach can be used for automatised screening purposes.","inCitations":["5c6c4475a264e1928e781e9077fac3072f19be3a","19466346084595e3d402a412eec3b8b438825909","ba59299faf480f2893b35e0f6c96dbdc7f579e01","3cf0bf04c6fc54288c1b8b85b5f0d30104167be6"],"title":"Phase Variation in Child and Adolescent Growth","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1045"}

GC is ideally suited for causal inference in bivariate vector autoregressive process (VAR). A zero magnitude of the upper or lower off-diagonal element(s) in a bivariate VAR is indicative of lack of causal relationship in that direction resulting in true acyclic structures. However, in experimental settings, statistical tests, such as F-test that rely on the ratio of the mean-squared forecast errors, are used to infer significant GC relationships. The present study investigates acyclic approximations within the context of bi-directional two-gene network motifs modeled as bivariate VAR. The fine interplay between the model parameters in the bivariate VAR, namely: (i) transcriptional noise variance, (ii) autoregulatory feedback, and (iii) transcriptional coupling strength that can give rise to discrepancies in the ratio of the mean-squared forecast errors is investigated. Subsequently, their impact on statistical power is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. More importantly, it is shown that one can arrive at acyclic approximations even for bi-directional networks for suitable choice of process parameters, significance level and sample size. While the results are discussed within the framework of transcriptional network, the analytical treatment provided is generic and likely to have significant impact across distinct paradigms.","inCitations":["94b7cfc597450c33485c84dd4c6cf4053f7e8b75","104c4f4c028a43b53be34c551b242cff4a1c9a05","976360163b1d6795f4f75698895b7266c5169997","13f2fba8c112177cd95916c0b5d6d680cc63c45b","726a6119becfbbca4d03137c79b14b42a3ce318d","31449556edf13c169e0712d08b8e40cf9e60bd8d","e48e485e67aba4b3e7f96509457be98f26180a96"],"title":"A Note on Inferring Acyclic Network Structures Using Granger Causality Tests","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1119"}

Within the semiparametric Cox proportional hazards model, we propose a bias-adjusted parameter estimator for the treatment coefficient and its asymptotic confidence interval at the end of the trial. The method for obtaining an asymptotic confidence interval and point estimator is based on a general distribution property of the final test statistic from the weighted linear rank statistics at the interims with or without considering the nuisance covariates. The computation of the estimates is straightforward. Extensive simulation studies show that the asymptotic confidence intervals have reasonable nominal probability of coverage, and the proposed point estimators are nearly unbiased with practical sample sizes.","inCitations":["e4a9501ddff3b756fbd9df66de43eea98a28e843"],"title":"Adaptive design: estimation and inference with censored data in a semiparametric model.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl011"}

Such modeling can provide estimates for important parameters that are defined on the paths of the process. A simple example is the mean first hitting time to a set of states. However, more interesting events are defined by several time points such as the first time the process stays in state j for at least Delta time units. These kinds of events are very important in relapsing-remitting diseases such as in multiple sclerosis (MS) where the focus is on a sustained worsening that lasts 6 months or longer. The current paper considers data on independent continuous Markov processes that are only observed intermittently. It reviews modeling and estimation, presents a new general concept of hitting times, and provides point and interval estimates for it. The methodology is applied to data from a phase III clinical trial of Avonex--a drug given to MS patients.","inCitations":["ee6ac3eab16d430ef85dd2e23da2b1fbd8ba4f17","2d3c2506c68ef910dd66d22a71805af26b85f34b","61f3817951a1465ce4072b012dc635f5ee06b86b","8c3c15104cb35140fa40dbb4a69f9dfb49565e65","edddff6d0a7e8db141d2007d5f20e33246bc69b4","3befea882feb5bf0cab5fcce76dc5e2685c669f5","e083996f187121b950dce181be43dccdf1741914","428326e6d546a3e83c2922394451a34c1cfa4764","c847ebae2cb7a8b8e9e1340a3aaf82fd6f486356","844f936952d6d0390704076c6115466095b59dd0","ee28c1c9311c23b50db7d71b3341d06155371042","26ac1a9097af80afe6504e62aa401deb31151592","73a7ad9beb7765f0ca5ba32c596cea2fad844baf","5256c264d42f4e3cbecc0975c9b7b5f0cde0618e","e00e825523f7282f314293f98a715521b7644c4c","26df925c9b42ef958070be7a59e6abf089cb68d1"],"title":"Estimating disease progression using panel data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp057"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2010,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In recent years, the use of adaptive designs in clinical trials has attracted much attention and been widely discussed within the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, regulatory agencies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and academia. A draft guidance has been released by the FDA and the 3-month public comment period has ended. In this issue, the Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics (JBS) publishes three special articles on this topic. Through these articles, this issue aims to open a forum for discussing relative merits (e.g., flexibility and efficiency) and potential disadvantages (e.g., feasibility and validity) when utilizing adaptive design methods in clinical trials from perspectives of regulatory agencies, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), academic researchers, and practitioners. The validity and integrity issues of an adaptive clinical trial design are also discussed. These three special articles are briefly described here. The first special article provides the summary of the morning session of a one-day spring conference on “Perspectives on the Use of Adaptive Designs in Clinical Trials.” There are two parts to this special article. In Part I, S. J. Wang gives her professional perspectives on the statistical considerations and issues of adaptive designs in clinical trials. In Part II, the perspectives of each of the six panelists, representing industry, academia, and regulatory agencies, are summarized. This spring conference was sponsored by the Basel Biometric Section (BBS) of the Austro-Swiss Region of the International Biometric Society and was chaired by F. Bretz and held at the Basel University, Basel, Switzerland, on March 12, 2010. The second special article is a collection of papers consisting of a leading article by the PhRMA Working Group on adaptive designs followed by several discussion papers on the FDA draft guidance by statistical scientists from pharmaceutical industry and academia. This special article was handled by M. Chang, who is one of our editorial board members. The third special article, by Q. Liu and G. Chi of Johnson and Johnson, attempts to provide a better understanding of the FDA’s draft guidance from a practitioner’s point of view. This special article focuses on historical burden, legal issues, and statistical perspectives. This special article was invited by one of our associate editors (M. Chang).","inCitations":["9618c9e22b80100b005c223ecc7b772dea74e98c","9ded43048b97f3537967856b464b0a7aebc5be42","b49913cfdf710617c46da4f1763d1433fb73f2c1","fe702c36320a86139292c2ae7f87e1810e744913"],"title":"A note on special articles on adaptive clinical trial designs.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.514444"}

The g-estimation method requires three different model specifications at each treatment interval under consideration: (1) the blip model; (2) the expected counterfactual model; and (3) the propensity model. Of these, the expected counterfactual model is especially difficult to specify correctly in practice and so far there has been little guidance as to how to check for model misspecification. Residual plots are a useful and standard tool for model diagnostics in the classical regression setting; we have adapted this approach for g-estimation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in a simulation study, and apply it to real data in the context of estimating the optimal time to stop breastfeeding.","inCitations":["e96d06351525051f6df82dd7ab3c17cc9e08b4c8","57113ff4e450b2ac5dc1c5ee775b5c99ef7fd296","c9b72123b3099af6642e25bf1530209c80686bf7","e59e5c138f912e279ad513fff1736137943202a7","701807cd854477a147e7b278e6e90a78e621a1d5","9c953423ca1bd7cf198afa0d78bad9092912c607","0e739d92688a413b0eeb693817543372bd4acc7e","45044d9d737591f5edad1e3ec3cd1165faddd69c","02a68da7fc6f21ecd011b006bb74a3427cb42b19","7e9b23865449dcee42b9229f9b559386d912790e"],"title":"Model Checking with Residuals for g-estimation of Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1210"}
