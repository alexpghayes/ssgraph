The data were obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The analytical method allows extracting the long-run deterministic trend from the cyclical and the random components. The long-run trend is estimated using six classical growth models and three more recent growth curves called Hyperbolastic growth models of types I, II, and III, denoted by H1, H2, and H3, respectively. The statistical results indicate that the H1 model provides the best fit of the data. The study is complemented by a mathematical analysis of the deterministic long-run component of the national healthcare expenditure (NHE) as modeled by H1. This analysis is performed by examining the behavior of the absolute growth rate (pace of increase curve), the relative growth rate, and the acceleration of the U.S. NHE over the 52-year time frame. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first application of Hyperbolastic models to economics data. This study can be used by researchers and policy makers as a descriptive as well as a predictive tool.","inCitations":["e4c76a1a970b634563eab3f4dbd2920565f94430","8e65a7f2d182cee0df61dd4afec1bdadfa59c421"],"title":"Modeling the Dynamics of the U.S. Healthcare Expenditure Using a Hyperbolastic Function.","doi":""}

Selection of important variables and selection of the functional form for continuous covariates are key parts of building such models but are notoriously difficult due to several reasons. Caused by multicollinearity between predictors and a limited amount of information in the data, (in)stability can be a serious issue of models selected. For applications with a moderate number of variables, resampling-based techniques have been developed for diagnosing and improving multivariable regression models. Deriving models for high-dimensional molecular data has led to the need for adapting these techniques to settings where the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations. Three studies with a time-to-event outcome, of which one has high-dimensional data, are used to illustrate several techniques. Investigations at the covariate level and at the predictor level are seen to provide considerable insight into model stability and performance. While some areas are indicated where resampling techniques for model building still need further refinement, our case studies illustrate that these techniques can already be recommended for wider use.","inCitations":["7a19cdd29ab681dd6146f99c73c106050647023f","6000fc8a7be0519d1af3b6364a95abe7d87f99c5","3149d0d57378b74071abba0db8ca0f7ec606b431","d4a33b9457d9a17e1747afd1d2d546b44cd606e3","b6eb7b69ababb12c9bdb0ae658d3eb5f93e50729","af4f022fbb032ff4b4b8a33a83d0a2fb39566c7f","f6efb4637ef7e19e72962be81ac4bc296136e62f","134c62f2c9c9fe33e060a2ec5da912c64c7a9617","f59f26e58c3ef4e99b88122143ecb57bfd5a97d4","624278706df0c7fc6727d3b390dc76bfcdd7b3fd","fed0a857bd99271b6badd73f32b4ca6e6528a92c","2153831e5a3df907b052b9c3cf6006da149d1cd3","7b2a79a92e2d760b23595a106b1c75042c362ac0","805c924c22a174457dbbe8786baf0e88aaa7aee3","14b2f11b85a5b6719a7c4f794e754a372b10bcbc","6443e793cc2d492f5235fbdc2d885ce5ccac7672","0db33cc27612f6a177f2b6b2b5e0550487111fa2","fac7cf72f2d3e007ecbf82e5eccc5ab9cea8ae98","c790255179bf6740339b4a23ea8999be7e6afd26","d15cccc3c99663c5dceaca0dc05b43ea1d785486","68f3c2591c5d01956aef86c8195c372e60555b8e","4907dd1622d9c4da708ccbfcc6e8bfe9da5014be","87477db8b28e5e9892580a22393290e906f30c84","b286bee7f796cd38df3edf0d19d6d9d0e7e8634b","6e797a17371fa5a1c10a3fea0fd30e8cf7726523","683acdd820a0ad8cab3cc339dd9b1b9f8b037d32","f02987a3e159bf03cc9ce8b7ef2036c19a4f5f72","d41e180011fd39a1b3f0da3c0ef633ae917e7e69","56a2e1d41c3e34e7c84293948f3e8bcca04460ed","79f8be276099cd58dae081ece8c45a5c948227ef","2fd5fdc4758fdb39a8abae37fc1ceb0496341490"],"title":"Stability investigations of multivariable regression models derived from low- and high-dimensional data.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.629890"}

However, computer simulations of a specific process are only as good as our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. An attractive supplement to simulations is the use of plasmode datasets. Plasmodes are data sets that are generated by natural biologic processes, under experimental conditions that allow some aspect of the truth to be known. The benefit of the plasmode approach is that the data are generated through completely natural processes, thus circumventing the common concern of the realism and accuracy of computer simulated data. The estimation of admixture, or the proportion of an individual's genome that originates from different founding populations, is a particularly difficult research endeavor that is well suited to the use of plasmodes. Current methods have been tested with simulations of complex populations where the underlying mechanisms such as the rate and distribution of recombination are not well understood. To demonstrate the utility of this method data derived from mouse crosses is used to evaluate the effectiveness of several admixture estimation methodologies. Each cross shares a common founding population so that the ancestry proportion for each individual is known, allowing for the comparison of true and estimated individual admixture values. Analysis shows that the different estimation methodologies (Structure, AdmixMap and FRAPPE) examined all perform well with simple datasets. However, the performance of the estimation methodologies varied greatly when applied to a plasmode consisting of three founding populations. The results of these examples illustrate the utility of plasmodes in the evaluation of statistical genetics methodologies.","inCitations":["bf4b7bebfe513df1674878507e92ae3752e1a799","fc8962cfd09fa7baaaa495d760873011c137536e","4b896ecc9c0aa623e213741cc379d9af3bcd4204","a45c278abbcf0a136b902155ada45f5ba4957e6c","047060cdb68bda4b092a514607fb1387e228b05f","9339111f4c1f4df1230d7e866e7df9b1d05dd02c","3e445f802cb73f5c90ec75034046844fe22006a2","bbcc9d1f08a0d9aac75e95e22d5432f0526ba195","217f32d8f973e2a1e364507a4ff01ceb1da89a34","92d28b9fa3f8d22c441c632d991dadadfccdb0fc","67c758dbb03e40b2a7f192ce7ddba25677e9f25f","161eabcbda99ae007133b2312c10881afecd247b","c476cdaa692a3ec3f4dca84d6d7b75a274c4c4bb"],"title":"The use of plasmodes as a supplement to simulations: A simple example evaluating individual admixture estimation methodologies","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.032"}

The maximisation is performed in two steps: First the support reduction algorithm is used to maximise the likelihood over all hazard functions with a given point of minimum (or antimode). Then it is shown that the profile (or partially maximised) likelihood is quasi-concave as a function of the antimode, so that a bisection algorithm can be applied to find the maximum of the profile likelihood, and hence also the global maximum. The new algorithm is illustrated using both artificial and real data, including lifetime data for Canadian males and females.","inCitations":["d4e62a35358a42801070bfaa4fc3563b1876d559","c480a248c3493968be6aea01c81c1c08425ca5b3","823c77abd49404ff8259b786ce3e83d3840f1376","b77f351af41526a339f2b442f770693ae2676082","6a1805d517847d4c34dd7fe5ca10d840f930051c","b8cafbdb360f6067fa2479d01a160b663822a96d"],"title":"Computation of nonparametric convex hazard estimators via profile methods.","doi":"10.1080/10485250902745359"}

The algorithm, based on a penalized least squares method, allows fast smoothing of data in one and higher dimensions by means of the discrete cosine transform. Automatic choice of the amount of smoothing is carried out by minimizing the generalized cross-validation score. An iteratively weighted robust version of the algorithm is proposed to deal with occurrences of missing and outlying values. Simplified Matlab codes with typical examples in one to three dimensions are provided. A complete user-friendly Matlab program is also supplied.

The first method discussed is the technique found in the literature and as such is the reference method for this paper. The compound crtierion is formed by maximizing a weighted product of efficiencies. The second criterion involves maximizing an opposing criterion while minimizing a defined loss function. The third method simultaneously maximizes both efficiencies with respect to parameter estimation and an opposing criterion with a multiple objective simulated annealing algorithm.

However, the analytical methods of the competing risks model differ from those appropriate for analyzing noninferiority clinical trials with a single outcome; thus, a corresponding method for planning such trials is necessary.

Typical fMRI experiments generate large datasets that exhibit complex spatial and temporal dependence. Fitting a full statistical model to such data can be so computationally burdensome that many practitioners resort to fitting oversimplified models, which can lead to lower quality inference. We develop a full statistical model that permits efficient computation. Our approach eases the computational burden in two ways. We partition the brain into 3D parcels, and fit our model to the parcels in parallel. Voxel-level activation within each parcel is modeled as regressions located on a lattice. Regressors represent the magnitude of change in blood oxygenation in response to a stimulus, while a latent indicator for each regressor represents whether the change is zero or non-zero. A sparse spatial generalized linear mixed model captures the spatial dependence among indicator variables within a parcel and for a given stimulus. The sparse SGLMM permits considerably more efficient computation than does the spatial model typically employed in fMRI. Through simulation we show that our parcellation scheme performs well in various realistic scenarios. Importantly, indicator variables on the boundary between parcels do not exhibit edge effects. We conclude by applying our methodology to data from a task-based fMRI experiment.","inCitations":["d1df7695c5ee7dc1c2b104e5a10e36c58bca8226","8bbda7a36d8823cec2554f24ae7ea42a0bad0468","a2e30b2a3371a102a6e23cdb9e59041cfdcebf70","fd1eb76b59d524339e711a1acc7b004bd92487e3","dc81342cf2c2c9d0727fe9a17d870bc56934b558","7ded5466150129f2033e15758bc59fd15f16cf32","a4fb787e33ad7db592f85983c34c429549b99138","4b4055efe59e7a58d4636d24f414adf1dd4ecf2c","56845542b59042b8f82dd9e5318a5c568cc62adb","48dd02f684de882e0cabd611d72f0c0190f8789b","617fec1c0f1bbc314bc90f43e0de9ddbc28c711d"],"title":"Fast, fully Bayesian spatiotemporal inference for fMRI data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv044"}

Blinded SSR, in particular, while in use already, seems poised to proliferate even further because it obviates many logistical complications of unblinded methods and it generally introduces little or no statistical or operational bias. On the other hand, current blinded SSR methods offer little to no new information about the treatment effect (TE); the obvious resulting problem is that the TE estimate scientists might simply 'plug in' to the sample size formulae could be severely wrong. This paper proposes a blinded SSR method that formally synthesizes sample data with prior knowledge about the TE and the within-treatment variance. It evaluates the method in terms of the type 1 error rate, the bias of the estimated TE, and the average deviation from the targeted power. The method is shown to reduce this average deviation, in comparison with another established method, over a range of situations. The paper illustrates the use of the proposed method with an example.","inCitations":["b4afb207eaa2e014f78c7a2d01597185b27db673","fc8d8a623db6b51922c6cd61d882e6e2861461be","090e6c9926263ba0563f37609187801e257fc229","2f3f2b45b460729de966bc881dba42dc2ced15b3"],"title":"Adaptive blinded sample size adjustment for comparing two normal means--a mostly Bayesian approach.","doi":"10.1002/pst.538"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2017,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In some randomized (drug versus placebo) clinical trials, the estimand of interest is the between-treatment difference in population means of a clinical endpoint that is free from the confounding effects of \"rescue\" medication (e.g., HbA1c change from baseline at 24 weeks that would be observed without rescue medication regardless of whether or when the assigned treatment was discontinued). In such settings, a missing data problem arises if some patients prematurely discontinue from the trial or initiate rescue medication while in the trial, the latter necessitating the discarding of post-rescue data. We caution that the commonly used mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis with the embedded missing at random assumption can deliver an exaggerated estimate of the aforementioned estimand of interest. This happens, in part, due to implicit imputation of an overly optimistic mean for \"dropouts\" (i.e., patients with missing endpoint data of interest) in the drug arm. We propose an alternative approach in which the missing mean for the drug arm dropouts is explicitly replaced with either the estimated mean of the entire endpoint distribution under placebo (primary analysis) or a sequence of increasingly more conservative means within a tipping point framework (sensitivity analysis); patient-level imputation is not required. A supplemental \"dropout = failure\" analysis is considered in which a common poor outcome is imputed for all dropouts followed by a between-treatment comparison using quantile regression. All analyses address the same estimand and can adjust for baseline covariates. Three examples and simulation results are used to support our recommendations.","inCitations":["b47187e3e4754bc90a6d7f2047fe1fd83c79db62","1f16567557f0ec030087cc6dd2739d7342fe861d","42b84093b0b29db6cf633a583ef3a2942124ec26","0ba1eee7fdbe4b389f4a115f75832616c0dbac7a","219cd7158892ef063619d31dde79d7a47628eaf8","1899d955e2b45fa89610b5b12bc8ea6061c8ed79"],"title":"Missing data in clinical trials: control-based mean imputation and sensitivity analysis.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1817"}

In this paper, we focus on a specific region and establish a statistical criterion to assess the consistency between the specific region and overall results in an MRCT. More specifically, we treat each region in an MRCT as an independent clinical trial, and each perhaps has different treatment effect. We then construct the empirical prior information for the treatment effect for the specific region on the basis of all of the observed data from other regions. We will conclude similarity between the specific region and all regions if the posterior probability of deriving a positive treatment effect in the specific region is large, say 80%.

The maximum absolute imbalance and the correct guess (CG) probability are selected to assess the trade-off performance of each randomization design. As measured by the maximum absolute imbalance and the CG probability, we found that performances of the 14 randomization designs are located in a closed region with the upper boundary (worst case) given by Efron's biased coin design (BCD) and the lower boundary (best case) from the Soares and Wu's big stick design (BSD). Designs close to the lower boundary provide a smaller imbalance and a higher randomness than designs close to the upper boundary. Our research suggested that optimization of randomization design is possible based on quantified evaluation of imbalance and randomness. Based on the maximum imbalance and CG probability, the BSD, Chen's biased coin design with imbalance tolerance method, and Chen's Ehrenfest urn design perform better than popularly used permuted block design, EBCD, and Wei's urn design.","inCitations":["c7a24ce631fa60340e7f347a6c429994950131e0","d6e8858fbde904d068bb9a532f6be24462d3d8fd","726b4c66fe28cf7f59e2d804a0c165ef7e682fe5","0455bac5e333ca5103b3b486b25d5e2660949d3c","89be1359fa5380a062c2e63fdbe2e3ca9f856fc1","3c13893bbb3cc87a92c9e16edffc08c85a1feaab","8fc874310e8f9846dc6a58a7d5e3a036ca5fce26","604ee82fca573f74ff6bf913da9c09bb6fafd3d0","97db36d7c87ceb7a5fff98e723cafe57b177e0e4","0818e1f01e6561c0448f6f04eb2009fb23802f36","a90d0f4f293c18c3074b3c83851e2f17694cc248","f77d030957d5a19a65240d657c32bd4cdec188ad","ac6c2bfa362cff42347bb1b48b3a404141693a52","ea747381d7ae18e0bd8374e3725f5fd12b54e114","7c4c27024e05e8610216b81a8d55822cab9e4b57","65256e00107d9be2bc6bc07b9a913d1032c5e6f3","e648f1416b5d4e8c8ef5d8bc4565b652d0cf5a5e"],"title":"Quantitative comparison of randomization designs in sequential clinical trials based on treatment balance and allocation randomness.","doi":"10.1002/pst.493"}

We propose a new class of covariate-adjusted LME models for longitudinal data that nonparametrically adjusts for a normalizing covariate. The proposed approach involves fitting a parametric LME model to the data after adjusting for the nonparametric effects of a baseline confounding covariate. In particular, the effect of the observable covariate on the response and predictors of the LME model is modeled nonparametrically via smooth unknown functions. In addition to covariate-adjusted estimation of fixed/population parameters and random effects, an estimation procedure for the variance components is also developed. Numerical properties of the proposed estimators are investigated with simulation studies. The consistency and convergence rates of the proposed estimators are also established. An application to a longitudinal data set on calcium absorption, accounting for baseline distortion from body mass index, illustrates the proposed methodology.","inCitations":["aaa1c9e57d96e7ce54ed247faf7269c6ea3a91e1","a67ec1a742939905fc41ff1f83a64d707de34743","15791b7ab4a0c6c77a5feb9eb18a701c55e9c43e","ac4f65015332404ca0f2b059800fe9d659288de9","4af659f89f61ab5e17a51aa98417a6763b03e7c7","5a9d8c42689e5f6164043c29a34eee19f94cf97c","570620ba188163aa6d1d3504f8dbb9908607697e","b58a9ba1dbf153e37ab60080252d73253ffbcafa","2e43c9bf0677bafbd2846075c8556d5bcdc761ec","c6228f60511e09c64d4980d0342974166f01521a","0912fd835cf6d0a6183748204cf9181ebbebfb93","1ba1478a7effa850186301f6bb10d4628b5b785e","ee3837d335c43019347274db8ff4402a0cfa2c8e","e45d523de5f00e6dd80cc7e8ca099bcfc857f2c6","91b844e9efb2ebf4b8996dfe555b54d8c8c3bf83","fd74c9a873b96ec634c1805de1d2826732357539","dbc9ea99ed598f0475a2f359bed9f163dcb29d07","1178624c857e497c526179d3fbcbc6ce7e436ebd","45f29a7728969bb2b29de11db45b597f2f61fa13","a2dfe9a6d122b4d4e1dcaf2117cdaabb70260c1d"],"title":"Covariate-Adjusted Linear Mixed Effects Model with an Application to Longitudinal Data.","doi":"10.1080/10485250802226435"}

In addition, attention to alignment of alleles within or across chromosomal pairs, commonly referred to as phase, may be essential for uncovering true biological associations. In the context of population based association studies, phase is generally unobservable. Preservation of type-1 error in a setting with multiple testing presents a further analytical challenge. This manuscript combines a likelihood-based approach to handling missing-ness in phase with a resampling method to adjust for multiple testing. Through simulations we demonstrate preservation of the family-wise error rate and reasonable power for detecting associations. The method is applied to a cohort of 626 HIV-1 infected individuals receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapies, to ascertain potential genetic contributions to abnormalities in lipid profiles. The haplotypic effects of 2 genes, hepatic lipase (HL) and endothelial lipase (EL), on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are tested.","inCitations":["35f39803143545ce6b1c1c4e224357a2ff8a0617","e33578d3c091a66d936a6f0ef3cfe8fddfd90c1a"],"title":"A Resampling-Based Approach to Multiple Testing with Uncertainty in Phase","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1037"}

Their approach is flawed in sampling, calculations, and conclusions. It uses a tiny portion of select papers in highly select journals. Randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews (designs with the lowest anticipated false-positive rates) are 52% of the analyzed papers, while these designs account for only 4% in PubMed in the same period. The FDR calculations consider the entire published literature as equivalent to a single genomic experiment where all performed analyses are reported without selection or distortion. However, the data used are the P-values reported in the abstracts of published papers; these P-values are a highly distorted, highly select sample. Besides selective reporting biases, all other biases, in particular confounding in observational studies, are also ignored, while these are often the main drivers for high false-positive rates in the biomedical literature. A reproducibility check of the raw data shows that much of the data Jager and Leek used are either wrong or make no sense: most of the usable data were missed by their script, 94% of the abstracts that reported ≥2 P-values had high correlation/overlap between reported outcomes, and only a minority of P-values corresponded to relevant primary outcomes. The Jager and Leek paper exemplifies the dreadful combination of using automated scripts with wrong methods and unreliable data. Sadly, this combination is common in the medical literature.","inCitations":["fdd0203ccc9990d64ab0f257058cf5b279f6b565","0e16a834632c2b54e746b1851afc1f3beccb1e53","105a19431ddfcfd2e6195176059a49c3232ddda4","7edfa14793fecf57a03b827bbfe71d4dcff08ae0","a6beda91090825037ba7b11646c6040c4d5c61cb","ba74d0bfdb58cb19177d64aa57ab03f5d0af7734","e044257d4711d9608ea7e1762f368018242d192d","4110fd67a667d73335115d99304f7855569e9e1e","479a565b678c78881326bcdb074c24bead02d883","d74ef42ff966fc22101732c94fcbfcc9c8bd78bc","2bf3c9fc1d2c8daa0fed9018635f6c44a98388ff","61d5eec74bf473f229dbe5c26199bd68ad17552f","a07a64ba110e0f9f7156f3bd1e376f0d2e1cddf1","c200905c35e9c7ab1e84efbd4d0c61d5b68b8017","d6aeb5e464617dfc566c68e51d299318ba1a76de","67c2f46d18e625b306980dc76cc8f7c5d90a652c","df4c369b984524801d47ad2ef7a0f52829a43c5c","5ba9b4b324e50ff00071bfe39b797b36bd3577b5","9bb9d687b3486c6a56600c7e6340eb37d2fd0eb1","8a3c34f7210018dd96710ba11245ac2035aeaa89"],"title":"Discussion: Why \"An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature\" is false.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt036"}

Here we focus on arm-based models and fit them using generalized linear mixed model procedures. Full maximum likelihood (ML) estimation leads to biased trial-by-treatment interaction variance estimates for heterogeneity. Thus, our objective is to investigate alternative approaches to variance estimation that reduce bias compared with full ML. Specifically, we use penalized quasi-likelihood/pseudo-likelihood and hierarchical (h) likelihood approaches. In addition, we consider a novel model modification that yields estimators akin to the residual maximum likelihood estimator for linear mixed models. The proposed methods are compared by simulation, and 2 real datasets are used for illustration. Simulations show that penalized quasi-likelihood/pseudo-likelihood and h-likelihood reduce bias and yield satisfactory coverage rates. Sum-to-zero restriction and baseline contrasts for random trial-by-treatment interaction effects, as well as a residual ML-like adjustment, also reduce bias compared with an unconstrained model when ML is used, but coverage rates are not quite as good. Penalized quasi-likelihood/pseudo-likelihood and h-likelihood are therefore recommended.","inCitations":["5ec6dddff8f7f2396f2aade4029f875faf4f3eab","fa78b6fff28f1609fc759300ce7e8fe044992aa8"],"title":"Estimating the variance for heterogeneity in arm-based network meta-analysis.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1857"}
