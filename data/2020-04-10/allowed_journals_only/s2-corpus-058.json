When evaluating the treatment effect for each local region, one may wish to utilize information from other regions to enhance the statistical power. This work proposes a Bayesian approach to bridging data across different regions in a multiregional trial to get an improved analysis of treatment effect for a local region. The new proposal has the following distinct features: (1) It performs internal bridging in a multiregional trial, with the degree of bridging automatically determined by the interregional variability of the treatment effect across different regions; (2) it usually ensures the consistency of the conclusions from local and global inference when the treatment effect is virtually homogeneous across regions and is found nonsignificant globally; (3) it generally protects against overbridging of the global information for evaluating the treatment effect in a very small region. Formulas for statistical power of the proposed method are provided. We illustrate the utility of the proposed method by two numerical examples reflecting typical issues we may encounter in evaluating regional treatment effect in a multiregional trial.","inCitations":["2f67827aaf5491361944392064385f79255182d1","f43d42a926582ac037429f86bf0736cf86edd873","f2d50a09e063f9de6ca2b1e1c45fb17e5ce3d8a4","a146dad1cf294f3445f4f400bd251e22512a42e5","8fec2193c8f0827eef91875505497d1adda25117","b12dc3f2ba8fa678e9096d87df132e4562cfeadc"],"title":"A Bayesian approach to evaluating regional treatment effect in a multiregional trial.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903105471"}

Furthermore we propose two model selection procedures for choosing between the different models. These model selection procedures are compared with two model selection procedures which have previously been used. In a simulation study we find that the model selection procedure that performs best depends on the underlying true situation. One of the new model selection procedures gives what may be regarded as the most robust of the procedures.","inCitations":["a55a32e4cda452f185ce8c0bec2ea862a9f89a80","d0ae7ec22aa337cea4a2f98c49bacc3ec876a6c8","e8ee84d0b3e6af64049b4cc4212d5b89611e2c1e","01eb641410c20ae47f1a83a1660fef439c1c8626","5fc74d2d28e69d3c367a9006720cfdf62d3475c2","dc17509a897b3dfe62731527caf6b461d5a23246"],"title":"Fitting E(max) models to clinical trial dose-response data.","doi":"10.1002/pst.432"}

We also propose two novel constraints in prior specifications for the GMRF model and a fully Bayesian approach to the DMRF model.

The challenge of constructing confidence intervals for NPY NT is due to the fact that exacerbation data or count data in general are usually analyzed using Poisson-based models such as Poisson or negative binomial regression and the rate ratio is the natural metric for between-treatment comparison, while NPY NT is based on rate difference, which is not usually calculated for those models. Therefore, the variance estimates from these analysis models are directly related to the rate ratio rather than the rate difference. In this paper, we propose several methods to construct confidence intervals for the NPY NT, assuming that the event rates are estimated using Poisson or negative binomial regression models. The coverage property of the confidence intervals constructed with these methods is assessed by simulations.","inCitations":["6e4cdf1790f316c8b1fa9253814c2997a5d6ea4d"],"title":"Confidence interval estimation for number of patient-years needed to treat.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1650"}

A variety of nonproportional hazards models have been proposed in the literature. However, available methods for flexibly estimating a possibly time-dependent hazard ratio are limited. Here, we investigate a semiparametric model that allows a wide range of time-varying hazard ratio shapes. Point estimates as well as pointwise confidence intervals and simultaneous confidence bands of the hazard ratio function are established under this model. The average hazard ratio function is also studied to assess the cumulative treatment effect.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2011,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Many applications in biostatistics rely on nonlinear regression models, such as, for example, population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, or modeling approaches for dose-response characterization and dose selection. Such models are often expressed as nonlinear mixed-effects models, which are implemented in all major statistical software packages. Inference on the model curve can be based on the estimated parameters, from which pointwise confidence intervals for the mean profile at any single point in the covariate region (time, dose, etc.) can be derived. These pointwise confidence intervals, however, should not be used for simultaneous inferences beyond that single covariate value. If assessment over the entire covariate region is required, the joint coverage probability by using the combined pointwise confidence intervals is likely to be less than the nominal coverage probability. In this paper we consider simultaneous confidence bands for the mean profile over the covariate region of interest and propose two large-sample methods for their construction. The first method is based on the Schwarz inequality and an asymptotic χ(2) distribution. The second method relies on simulating from a multivariate normal distribution. We illustrate the methods with the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. In addition, we report the results of an extensive simulation study to investigate the operating characteristics of the two construction methods. Finally, we present extensions to construct simultaneous confidence bands for the difference of two models and to assess equivalence between two models in biosimilarity applications.","inCitations":["169c92100391ab77a0b9efbac3702ec087fe3753","a4b68e54e3043cb1d186778a092f927fb8968243","d01f1acdad5c132741b8e0a060612a679c3e3e2e","6318470e1e19c99b2f8e64e16b177a21dcf6a99c","558428d3906e9ee2dcd1f47cff6128d195903d4a","01fa098cb5ef5c588bfda6ad5c72d7e6968e3714","cb5e04b32f2f977795185182ea93a4143d733f99","487a0e0a8a801b51ab3f6716896a7a7f0a0b2243","292cf65beea35709ebe6376e761bee80e52e4329","31af792bb07e9e2fc49c68edda9d248ea4da595b"],"title":"Simultaneous confidence bands for nonlinear regression models with application to population pharmacokinetic analyses.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.551332"}

However, determining the exact moment in time at which a neuron spikes, from a calcium imaging data set, amounts to a non-trivial deconvolution problem which is of critical importance for downstream analyses. While a number of formulations have been proposed for this task in the recent literature, in this article, we focus on a formulation recently proposed in Jewell and Witten (2018. Exact spike train inference via $\\ell_{0} $ optimization. The Annals of Applied Statistics12(4), 2457-2482) that can accurately estimate not just the spike rate, but also the specific times at which the neuron spikes. We develop a much faster algorithm that can be used to deconvolve a fluorescence trace of 100 000 timesteps in less than a second. Furthermore, we present a modification to this algorithm that precludes the possibility of a \"negative spike\". We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm for spike deconvolution on calcium imaging datasets that were recently released as part of the $\\texttt{spikefinder}$ challenge (http://spikefinder.codeneuro.org/). The algorithm presented in this article was used in the Allen Institute for Brain Science's \"platform paper\" to decode neural activity from the Allen Brain Observatory; this is the main scientific paper in which their data resource is presented.

For large data sets, our algorithm remains fast and has no current competitors. Thus, in contrast to published methods, we can now conduct routine simulations, leave-one-out analyses, and nonparametric bootstrap sampling. Our methods are inspired by and applied to data obtained from a state-of-the-art colon carcinogenesis scientific experiment.

This method is a convenient way to calculate relative gene expression levels between different samples in that it directly uses the threshold cycles (CTs) generated by the qPCR system for calculation. However, this approach relies heavily on an invalid assumption of 100% PCR amplification efficiency across all samples. In addition, the 2-ΔΔCT method is applied to data with automatic removal of background fluorescence by the qPCR software. Since the background fluorescence is unknown, subtracting an inaccurate background can lead to distortion of the results. To address these problems, we present an improved method, the individual efficiency corrected calculation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur method takes into account the PCR efficiency of each individual sample. In addition, it eliminates the need for background fluorescence estimation or subtraction because the background can be cancelled out using the differencing strategy. The DNA amount for a certain gene and the relative DNA amount among different samples estimated using our method were closer to the true values compared to the results of the 2-ΔΔCT method.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe improved method, the individual efficiency corrected calculation, produces more accurate estimates in relative gene expression than the 2-ΔΔCT method and is thus a better way to calculate relative gene expression.","inCitations":["b721e584c0f08de2a13b813ff79802f89908e5ce","e2eca1c71d64fb64748b42a44c0e7186f6dc6909","56eec5348ab8feff9a6268aa0f8926a3ca928afd","0cc31bca6ca192e459bb0482ba2c25dff2bb9dbd","41c91cfcb912f5eeb9febf8632afd25fbed5d732","8aa80c797ba5fa590079e091fa0fe96dc2f05e4d","30f7cc191a5c02d89c1d608a0fb243e91b243f35","00f9928c60efac771a0506d465718719cfa1a51f","af3f144abf83198a0cd23afe5583d37aee12c791","93c0536dad9a8a5a50db8192232239422aa47569","21b8a5f9a61d91e72f0bc48ecd773d0fa7c68ad9","33a9ec26201e76a0790598a2b3fb1617d5f745ab","8fd1dab8682c22d9be5776bf1849a7addeccc2ef","ab9a642a2c1ff173bdf7c8895a7e0e889b5322ca","bf115328398835263be997d9594f3e8e224cedfa","595583c0a490a2e456988b24a4c74725a8f89e69","f1fe9efea6391f8c686d9d647a24af47507aeaad","0642aa82ba6c386d93da5fc3a09efb055461d179","6cdf646c255eac9ccfb19047a423efdff18e0d3f","f6e5b610e2d50f8cdc195f933bc64b0a6e051e47","b47a441595afd4da5e0753ee74b0f28a449d235c","12dda34334e880c853c6dc8b34eaab66c731f824","c7499446c297c9a8577fd8355b797d1d8d186bcd","26b4ad7d29639ab91b1c6c162d7159d147d15258","755df44822e77a3691d62f760ad292cabf2ceb07","d27d9e74e7dcb48118e556b34f77ff106b3643ea","b7ab4aaaf92b420e18849ca22e5d7b8d64c68d91","417c3b2d0ca9900546eb31f8e972e775d2dec32a","72044851f148e82b35080ea7feb0784ccedde8ea","2c95122b977ae4033c3707955bc706b192d9272d","96f3b8b524c6d6a0c2cb49d2ca1ad9187a42dd6d","b4ce847418fbaec6b9d9b6b11f4a42d79f5229f8","8665b6c92ff80730016c8f36ab8aa8d391ee131b","226fff9691de2cc6098f9c34ee7e90a645a35689","6b61adb1e8e4680ee3c4f1326b1b6e8592b5a5e1","89f534f781518f27ad7e5797de291712ccc84412","b30f336c1f924d0b72a525939ba68b8489effff2","de4c2f202f510bbc00ba60ce866be8e21c88a36c","d25de3e9105b5764b5aae06cca3b93ea3940102f","7f8f0ebc9ea61fdd7f7d72f0e5149a49c25052ea","fd83b7c835276aea07f65bab64fc25bf2093810a","2968fc76a77fa7b70a79589b2c2e381dbcd8ee46","c504e50820d0e89bd6d7d652e1bb4a02ca363d0a","4210f4f72416af04fdacb0ccfd5414def9aad636","d9bb40079266c658e76141f9cc11634a66700eaa","1cbf92185a90fcc6d7b3ea52631261cab1e96ccd","268f760e9ee18db96b34267fb1018aeb351d40c7","cf022ce68d8e3a794517544f2bdaccbfed15c7e4","04c282f06fb83a3f903779896b7535ad7346d638","7eabbf86f922073e879ce8ce6a9fc7ff2d53f103","aea6db52e67929933233da1848b3412c13bc4551","bdcbda0788629ff4d1d72f8076da2f7f1ef99dc3","6403608940bbd9ea4991e1897989cda1fcc14fb7","11240153b57e49f345879757ae32172fc63d7a63","214c82a5f6d5c34b6f8e8fbb0250bf0a1202b435","20430a3dd10d1360722529508fd887e20d85158f","e912d0d62221d18711bc67fd707317aed4cf08fa","9764ea36e0daf2f1d843c308503d79807973bcc5","4596243a4d50f39f7763d56cab7f2a80d2a97dd0","fe7b24923001be520f9f4c0d71fb94df62461428","81d5328dd36740961ae134b61a786cc8b68636a2","861b5e19748d93085739ea5e29f78a9cee1df2dd","8bf617007550d9b48d8b4d6a6e9bacccd024a7f6","3eb06eaff24bbeb8b758a0ebf38d49e11587807e","00eb850ea8550676a8b9eebca092126449a41b2c","de6eefe729bbbabae1af9b7add136d82fc878f9d","7cab5ef958cbd78c9f676eaac0390382863c398d","3e9963625e81109ee674bc49eacf355efe951f36","6d8628b04498b7b4b4b702004256f10c34bd60a0","fda9ae50a983a2d17ba02c71b6c0cf4a748fab91","a99d029532b9c0c035bfee389907c23d2445672b","99519853e32433119487669684c5f4f7c80ded93","9190c2ab3ef1aa0404b0a5192b6233c74ca38ae4","4c87c159997986931eca1f88fe8a14c66846b0bd","908b34e19ab7d41546f86cc77bf4d2e20fd9a7ca","751cec80a4e9e88f0d77c494abf4e72c3f79bfec","a577f35bc354f30019b8b22911cdc35a87d2ef9a","a4116ab8675adbe47bfa6927ab51ec798c52a5c4","db791343dd225a35fd8953dfcdbc1db44acda43f","6f996251ddbc55781fde36cd65f8b75a5c864e31","f0aed8ca074bb8c3253a455830d06fa8ec1a57e1","5b129184c819bdaef3583be54d7c6837a7a3b1d5","71ee54157481a10322086757e8519a2927027c2b","e6610e0e127e194086d990862ca6df574e59ce7d","0c73e6f719c54ae084049a975840fbe2dd9d9073","12f7366f41e88f4f2c93088f90be1b2ad57cf9cf","b2bd9344b27f1a35b3ea9cc3f40e11a1d8ad9d48","9a98240c4b4f157f72437d5b029d4652e7fcaf6d","372de4ea97c7c3802f1533fb8703c562b9c8f9f9","3e5f1c7bff33101867fb6fbc1452a17e42a3f699","746ad7def49424cfcec048d3e623eb074a134784","7bf2cb72a4f380d84892b49a0f37ea9530f43b80","4d3d6183b4534aa0d20c6f12a63a07d76e406247","911aaef873790c77123569da2bc2c1cf134c4db7","02ffc6f71094e47c4959cd7f9f8cf72b5d6cecc2","162f91f72a48f3c525ab232a21d5b4ecb2274f67","de6e73b3aff0beebad53767e5f2528535d720819","e920c29c6396a2fb4ff95956046b7f46b924d127","d3b233c1152fe5a3fbed15dca30f934f812bff5c","6dce3fb6a03751e494d63f412eaf867b11147cc3","485e25a94e9cb2c6dcc460dcf981c1b1a5a1a131","b98bb69f4160df210f82e16e2cefc160844fd3cf","42b0c4fe6c15101f87640bb7786375afe391221d","b51228c34ed63d49cc3c2872481aa23c378b7ffb","a45fa82f50502dbc3f3d4acac333e69f1deae96b","401d4afbea057f0bbfed788b235dc2cf5e352487","1471733eff8bf3375d52823cc0244befd013df8c","185925eb8d41def1399160331efc065e062637a7","0a1c5a0e86a7f0f88d4e8fdab8750bc7998ca674","9d53e05e452eaf2a726d1a07314aa6641dfa0604","512a31c77deb54f19fc02b18f019c2448140dad6","52b1004818d2e841ea474acb13f5edf8f5e59816","665493c700889b27ddf9830dcd5778f5621799b8","912787e767ffaa2d0bd2d7b763df03fe2cb77f1e","0a70461b0b5ae22dd9fe568b12b652e85c7dc4bb","a2ede11b542f7bc783e36b0749
