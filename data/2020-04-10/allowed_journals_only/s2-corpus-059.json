However, conditional models are not always compatible. In this paper, a Gibbs sampling-based approach - Gibbs ensemble -is proposed to search for a joint distribution that deviates least from a prescribed set of conditional distributions. The algorithm can be easily scalable such that it can handle large data sets of high dimensionality. Using simulated data, we show that the proposed approach provides joint distributions that are less discrepant from the incompatible conditionals than those obtained by other methods discussed in the literature. The ensemble approach is also applied to a data set regarding geno-polymorphism and response to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal.","inCitations":["8190e260763e46d5883806627e63539110571248","c26c1d6b8f1b662ff52230ea106f05b40ac0060a","e5afacab42153f24b8e4ca543bd0ecae4e810f10","c53940c615f9db7ea05149608ab770b946e1c9ee","187d1c153cc0e7cdcdbf3fff8a4195d244dab986","566264fb27cd245285260e5a0e357dca7e65280f"],"title":"Gibbs ensembles for nearly compatible and incompatible conditional models","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2010.11.006"}

Details on power analysis and sample-size determination are given. For data sets with heavy tails, we propose applying a bootstrap methodology to a transformed sample by a downweighting procedure. One of the key conditions for safe bootstrap inference is generally satisfied by the transformed sample but may not be satisfied by the original sample with heavy tails. Several data sets illustrate that, by combining downweighting and bootstrapping, a researcher may find a nearly optimal procedure for evaluating various aspects of covariance structure models. A rule for handling non-convergence problems in bootstrap replications is proposed.","inCitations":["9e0ddd324238decdc635f06c0212b8b03d5373df","0111c0b20044abeddd853e80aaa82b47154737f9","f4536abec3178ac0415969b61e63412b8312628b","3beffe8ba5916c82253849bae3dcb376a2b7d8ae","0b8e75f12ad308df8ed7c351ef472854b35c0323","3e3e40ad2f62224cd6f1867f415e4952ea7224ef","9355babdb1b31c058ac6b7d144324be641335b0b","5560fc5a6c8a8a8b3bd55004bc88db96e13156b8","6af55b3ec42b437d9e28e4494cec548025ed4c9d","00ca70b29e3f23b74f7c438cc00a84edbb4039ec","42539a98a04596a7d02a9c94fd99c6c98f8d3741","9c1654735953f14881100db4e1176cc4bedbb12a","e8ca4925461da00a00736d86b85564a0ad6832c4","c95a5fa1c1ded4131d0fe5b3178cf3f9b05301a1","be22ef6b37ace449a52c7f0649238e823709b331","fd521fe704cad44215efb940c14f60beed06f12e","8dbf423271dd17746d4682a1e1991b401d1d8d91","fa58ccea2097b53240a8c49d526e3832e544a039","eb6d945a9c22b90f1d0cfa3d9925995071235bd2","d88db3def28e10ebafdead7df6589a71f264ab2a","351314c3498f53d4998677cb7396f9028bac920f","b86a408308f97a3a82e799398164424b05d30c4d","e8d04113cf4b944590509f45d0ba3d7a6b13b4cb","9d6a2510e61e0b8c1b680cb5eea189cbb8f062d7","ffa7f9752ef7891e0dafa0a30fd69f701505b4d2","f0ba7f0569a03943770c11d75772e1b90b160dd4","2d67566975e53c3f53d4645bb1eea7313423980a","169a76c94747a1b713c008d6e26eb492d9d9f691","76db817142cf185c529b1703fd3ac85bf11c50d6","8cc8513ff40bd7fbc94dd2fb9c0cb843f0d71e14","d0a70c54ccbec1511ac27e4504060141aeecd382","eb8a0f0aaa81aaec3e739dd9737a7c84e88f529c","236f151ba111c689c58b2ad400f50199c7e08e29","559563daff0cbfd231cd99464fb50f300e1541ac","65206cdfde32afc7adb311e04e8ecfce8a93a443","33690ff21ef1efb576410e656f2e60c89d0307d6","9235322dd3bf687764a5ce125a07277b45462f63","3b71c545c415b69e47723e497e988bc2c1a9c706","faf63349439c31171633d6a975902ca8cd27c7fe","9438ddc93f38b085dd03cbfea1f1daec47c46cd7","6b5443759dca4ac1711719a11490fb79b27dcd9c","55a80d067eaaa89a658261859360736f2058821e","b229971a07ab681c21e8a32269e6fd6c138ebd2b","7a0861bc63a79c33a70d5a7a6c8c8436b1db399d","df40565c2fd3129899f600a42e77889f0410be0d","58d92d220381a733b92c35ae737d1d2aa3601eef","4bdf6c48b78ba589cf5efb198581431865531bd8","53bee0858170dc871eb452fdfa2fb2d040a5ba0a"],"title":"Bootstrap approach to inference and power analysis based on three test statistics for covariance structure models.","doi":"10.1348/000711003321645368"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2018,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"An objective in randomized clinical trials is the evaluation of \"principal surrogates,\" which consists of analyzing how the treatment effect on a clinical endpoint varies over principal strata subgroups defined by an intermediate response outcome under both or one of the treatment assignments. The latter effect modification estimand has been termed the marginal causal effect predictiveness (mCEP) curve. This objective was addressed in two randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 dengue vaccine trials for an antibody response biomarker whose sampling design rendered previously developed inferential methods highly inefficient due to a three-phase sampling design. In this design, the biomarker was measured in a case-cohort sample and a key baseline auxiliary strongly associated with the biomarker (the \"baseline surrogate measure\") was only measured in a further sub-sample. We propose a novel approach to estimation of the mCEP curve in such three-phase sampling designs that avoids the restrictive \"placebo structural risk\" modeling assumption common to past methods and that further improves robustness by the use of non-parametric kernel smoothing for biomarker density estimation. Additionally, we develop bootstrap-based procedures for pointwise and simultaneous confidence intervals and testing of four relevant hypotheses about the mCEP curve. We investigate the finite-sample properties of the proposed methods and compare them to those of an alternative method making the placebo structural risk assumption. Finally, we apply the novel and alternative procedures to the two dengue vaccine trial data sets.","inCitations":["922b66707d8c38e277f00c2805559af98d1a4952"],"title":"Inference on treatment effect modification by biomarker response in a three-phase sampling design.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy074"}

Complete-linkage hierarchical clustering is perhaps the best-known heuristic method for the MDPP and has an extensive history of applications in psychological research. Unfortunately, this method has several inherent shortcomings that impede the model selection process, such as: (1) sensitivity to the input order of the objects, (2) failure to obtain a globally optimal minimum-diameter partition when cutting the tree at K clusters, and (3) the propensity for a large number of alternative minimum-diameter partitions for a given K. We propose that each of these problems can be addressed by applying an algorithm that finds all of the minimum-diameter partitions for different values of K. Model selection is then facilitated by considering, for each value of K, the reduction in the partition diameter, the number of alternative optima, and the partition agreement among the alternative optima. Using five examples from the empirical literature, we show the practical value of the proposed process for facilitating model selection for the MDPP.","inCitations":["bbf983d9a98e18f24f008ea095f097968f21934f","3feba7617e4cada3402332f382c096c51b9659af","833abe34567fc3c57405724939dae8fe164a7777","fdb314ddd6d34bb8b2cf5dd018060e386c57ece7","63447e887db640e50d4fb721e20874718259ee39"],"title":"Model selection for minimum-diameter partitioning.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12029"}

As an extension of these models, this paper presents piecewise growth mixture Tobit models (PGMTMs) for describing phasic changes of individual trajectories over time where the longitudinal data has a mixture of subpopulations and where left censoring due to a lower limit of detection (LOD) is also observed. There has been relatively little work done simultaneously modeling heterogeneous growth trajectories, segmented phases of progression, and left-censoring with skewed responses. The proposed methods are illustrated using real data from an AIDS clinical study. Analysis results suggested two classes of viral load growth trajectories: Class 1 started with a decline in viral load after treatment but rebound after change-point; Class 2 had a decrease the same as the Class 1 and continued a slower decrease over time.","inCitations":["ccf3d942088726ac6231a07d21af68aba29bc6a8"],"title":"Piecewise Growth Mixture Tobit Models: Application to AIDS Studies.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.1002363"}

In the presence of such measurement limitations, we consider several ways in which MIRT models are nevertheless useful in lending insight into how response styles may interfere with measurement for a given test instrument. Such a study can also inform whether alternative design considerations (e.g., anchoring vignettes, self-report items of heterogeneous content) that seek to control for response style effects may be helpful. We illustrate several aspects of an MIRT approach using real and simulated analyses.","inCitations":["e4f8382dbbf576ccf1320fae6e3f60a632020228","a8edc1c812e58c16605f384562e12040ee34b37b","73c60f684bd0cd31efbb349e784d03bf5e816925"],"title":"Using multidimensional item response theory to evaluate how response styles impact measurement.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12169"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a condition characterized by acute onset of severe hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. ALI patients typically require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV), a time-varying dynamic treatment regime, has been recommended as an effective ventilation strategy. This recommendation was based on the results of the ARMA study, a randomized clinical trial designed to compare low vs. high tidal volume strategies (The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network, 2000) . After publication of the trial, some critics focused on the high non-adherence rates in the LTVV arm suggesting that non-adherence occurred because treating physicians felt that deviating from the prescribed regime would improve patient outcomes. In this paper, we seek to address this controversy by estimating the survival distribution in the counterfactual setting where all patients assigned to LTVV followed the regime. Inference is based on a fully Bayesian implementation of Robins' (1986) G-computation formula. In addition to re-analyzing data from the ARMA trial, we also apply our methodology to data from a subsequent trial (ALVEOLI), which implemented the LTVV regime in both of its study arms and also suffered from non-adherence.","inCitations":["23de15ba98a7ba54beb2d847ee32a8767270d548","6c3e73ec2dc264205a9f7cd01617f480e0b6e183","f5c4d1d1c3ca778515ffb8d219efbc64cd7baf04","ce1eef1a97c1e34f272fa4b73b2ea3e2fed9638c","38608c46b0c9cf0ba07119e0745122e3c90403ef"],"title":"Estimating the Causal Effect of Low Tidal Volume Ventilation on Survival in Patients with Acute Lung Injury.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00757.x"}

In survey research, this is often the most practical, and sometimes the only, way to observe certain classes of networks, with the sexual networks that underlie HIV transmission being the archetypal case. Although methods exist for recovering some descriptive network features, there is no rigorous and practical statistical foundation for estimation and inference for network models from such data. We identify a subclass of exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) amenable to being estimated from egocentrically sampled network data, and apply pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimation to do so and to rigorously quantify the uncertainty of the estimates. For ERGMs parametrized to be invariant to network size, we describe a computationally tractable approach to this problem. We use this methodology to help understand persistent racial disparities in HIV prevalence in the US. We also discuss some extensions, including how our framework may be applied to triadic effects when data about ties among the respondent's neighbors are also collected.","inCitations":["e4a7a9ded506fcd33c496827cff88ca4fdbab27a","5708e0dbc79e98764c47534f60aec3b52e459cee","af802de0575a4470f600a4c0dc5281f187bc90f3","ed3c431044d7ac7b5906dc7fc4428cb1508b1ea8","d22ef5238da6af68efa6648d982dde971e47417c","e7287e5873c8958cc009837bf84fb7b2f2cfd942","fe5d8f7a6560aa422f87d089159da4d50df203e2","e9eade17ea23d7f5e7482d9c0fbdc7ff672d3c09","e8577fbb205f268dba84a252d00b2f0d0ebd1075","82ad81b0705e0f8dc0656687a55f237eee16012d","f41ba570b43d3a11ad0569feb6d56f62413681d6","93f942490eb76f0f04bed32ce23f0b3bb984abdb","c00946a3c865853b02334c140ce4dda282a75bb2","9c24119444eedf11a5cd56c49853dd98966bf5d5","7a5c8314663e1d44f9080a315419b9ec2b4ad353"],"title":"Inference for Social Network Models from Egocentrically Sampled Data, with Application to Understanding Persistent Racial Disparities in Hiv Prevalence in the Us.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS1010"}

In this paper, we are interested in identifying the influential users (i.e., portal nodes) in a social network under the framework of NAM. Especially, we consider the autoregression model that allows to have a heterogenous and sparse network effect coefficients. Therefore, the portal nodes take influential powers which are corresponding to the nonzero network effect coefficients. A screening procedure is designed to screen out the portal nodes and the strong screening consistency is established theoretically. A quasi maximum likelihood method is applied to estimate the influential powers. The asymptotic normality of the resulting estimator is established. Further selection procedure is given by taking advantage of the local linear approximation algorithm. Extensive numerical studies are conducted by using a Sina Weibo dataset for illustration purpose.","inCitations":["4911bb13b926abb96c9ab7a6c4cd01e667a20fd3"],"title":"Portal Nodes Screening for Large Scale Social Networks.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.12.021"}

While most existing methods allow some degree of correlations among predictors but do not consider these correlations for variable selection, our method accounts for correlations among the predictors in variable selection. Our correlation-based stochastic search (CBS) method, the hybrid-CBS algorithm, extends a popular search algorithm for high-dimensional data, the stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) method. Similar to SSVS, we search the space of all possible models using variable addition, deletion or swap moves. However, our moves through the model space are designed to accommodate correlations among the variables. We describe our approach for continuous, binary, ordinal, and count outcome data. The impact of choices of prior distributions and hyper-parameters is assessed in simulation studies. We also examined performance of variable selection and prediction as the correlation structure of the predictors varies. We found that the hybrid-CBS resulted in lower prediction errors and better identified the true outcome associated predictors than SSVS when predictors were moderately to highly correlated. We illustrate the method on data from a proteomic profiling study of melanoma, a skin cancer.","inCitations":["736768a4fa7af2cd9f9ee844e053fd280b6e2d56","73a73996e028a61dac38a4a41ca00932e3b45dab","9386ed54aba167a251886ec18e2eb2b36aeecfc6","bfe21abb2de735e3f1b7173bebb4bae1d8f07cb0","606e3b0f78a37fe008f3aad40732da55333a9b2a","21d5f2d8dac3df5e2944cb610a720e7a0fcd52ff","3681373a791aeadc637ba927cdaf483fc5b3e959","cbf653ace0930b9ed7838b0db67596c13827b77e","eab1d339a6e1447aa0f85a855b44ff3b11eeb6be","4b9b5702e9ea6dde3aba963cbc39781694ad7bbb","930352bf26d73091b1e8e1c564376cc6fa57d9e7","6867909cf5a7a453772e3f10d51a3e265fdaeb0e","8d64ff7ebc97200971d51a799db4c9ffc80c0a3f","1bc87c7609dd995a75960e7e11f1944263fd0150"],"title":"An efficient stochastic search for Bayesian variable selection with high-dimensional correlated predictors","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2011.04.019"}

Most commonly used methods include single single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis or haplotype analysis with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Since the SNPs in typical GWAS are often in linkage disequilibrium (LD), at least locally, Bonferroni correction of multiple comparisons often leads to conservative error control and therefore lower statistical power. In this paper, we propose a hidden Markov random field model (HMRF) for GWAS analysis based on a weighted LD graph built from the prior LD information among the SNPs and an efficient iterative conditional mode algorithm for estimating the model parameters. This model effectively utilizes the LD information in calculating the posterior probability that an SNP is associated with the disease. These posterior probabilities can then be used to define a false discovery controlling procedure in order to select the disease-associated SNPs. Simulation studies demonstrated the potential gain in power over single SNP analysis. The proposed method is especially effective in identifying SNPs with borderline significance at the single-marker level that nonetheless are in high LD with significant SNPs. In addition, by simultaneously considering the SNPs in LD, the proposed method can also help to reduce the number of false identifications of disease-associated SNPs. We demonstrate the application of the proposed HMRF model using data from a case-control GWAS of neuroblastoma and identify 1 new SNP that is potentially associated with neuroblastoma.","inCitations":["d0ce07ce69e7b2e768700c9b13bfbaca6acbe648","097971c56bfb77f88b34b4c9c979d1c8b61a40e7","b21a0969e496c03e8bc6bdce04c0261e69fb964d","57dbb8c80c863d5f2a5a402c3f91fa387e0f7ae9","a469a69a4261da6825a97ab8141dfa4952281a68","46d38bdd5998f20d018d3cc511229a576ac3f622","411e62888e48ee7e8b638b15c066d613a9c1b75c","c4a664944df4973941eab35742efbc20f919072d","bb2afe51f279e56636be02e5bf76904c782f8123","a1058e24d18384d7697d5472b706dd86bd5983b8","4615d2a9874625f83cbc45cf8280d332f8123854","9dde4f4d578cb7c3e4fc2510562c02d5b96ee83f","56cf8f1b4abbf5b0efbe88d0f9cf9cfe8b11cfa7","a2ad7051bcb3f50fd9e72754f92c023ee90ec972","6714afed9c76b17dc4f30e1dcaadd5a7fd98d8af","ac73d3374b463ff008b4e52d3959a8e0a441e496","42ae6e302c6d2c8b7bc21c7a4e43e63850eb2526","3406c272d114fc6c340fb07f5c76a78b01af32bd","736ddd3f77455b0331e2324aec06f4aea2fed919","51edd84aa03882ff5ff3eb62cc96d59d1bba3305","63c8b17f507b461e0143791f00aaff4c01fdb093","4b9e56cc473dd28cfaaafdad0628436e964bb103","645ea0752b7fab2c3c27933a18eb50612f71251a","6d962648c4c48b1004197d8e93e7fb04bcc64597","b17a7cdf0db0d00ca8565bb6d58a756509b028cf","83f4319287cf4befbf13e423a31c9ffbfdf0804c"],"title":"A hidden Markov random field model for genome-wide association studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp043"}

These techniques allow peptides (short amino acid sequences) and proteins from multiple samples of a batch being detected and quantified in a single experiment, and as such greatly improve the efficiency of protein profiling. However, the batch-processing of samples also results in severe batch effects and non-ignorable missing data occurring at the batch level. Motivated by the breast cancer proteomic data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, in this work, we developed two tailored multivariate MIxed-effects SElection models (mvMISE) to jointly analyze multiple correlated peptides/proteins in labeled proteomics data, considering the batch effects and the non-ignorable missingness. By taking a multivariate approach, we can borrow information across multiple peptides of the same protein or multiple proteins from the same biological pathway, and thus achieve better statistical efficiency and biological interpretation. These two different models account for different correlation structures among a group of peptides or proteins. Specifically, to model multiple peptides from the same protein, we employed a factor-analytic random effects structure to characterize the high and similar correlations among peptides. To model biological dependence among multiple proteins in a functional pathway, we introduced a graphical lasso penalty on the error precision matrix, and implemented an efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. Simulations demonstrated the advantages of the proposed models. Applying the proposed methods to the motivating data set, we identified phosphoproteins and biological pathways that showed different activity patterns in triple negative breast tumors versus other breast tumors. The proposed methods can also be applied to other high-dimensional multivariate analyses based on clustered data with or without non-ignorable missingness.","inCitations":["6e19e6bb94f785916752be61aa169dc11f6aa05c"],"title":"Using multivariate mixed-effects selection models for analyzing batch-processed proteomics data with non-ignorable missingness.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy022"}

However, searching for epistasis on the genome-wide scale has been challenging due to the prohibitively large number of tests which result in a serious loss of statistical power as well as computational challenges. In this article, we propose a two-stage method applicable to existing case-control data sets, which aims to lessen both of these problems by pre-assessing whether a candidate pair of genetic loci is involved in epistasis before it is actually tested for interaction with respect to a complex phenotype. The pre-assessment is based on a two-locus genotype independence test performed in the sample of cases. Only the pairs of loci that exhibit non-equilibrium frequencies are analyzed via a logistic regression score test, thereby reducing the multiple testing burden. Since only the computationally simple independence tests are performed for all pairs of loci while the more demanding score tests are restricted to the most promising pairs, genome-wide association study (GWAS) for epistasis becomes feasible. By design our method provides strong control of the type I error. Its favourable power properties especially under the practically relevant misspecification of the interaction model are illustrated. Ready-to-use software is available. Using the method we analyzed Parkinson's disease in four cohorts and identified possible interactions within several SNP pairs in multiple cohorts.","inCitations":["2ebbaa0be8ccadf1ce52865f059ebfc8b73f1e87","e321353e3582a52d67d268f44c6e69d8c516fe74","fa7dc2ffd04b7ab68960736bd1e81399bd1413c3","0326f69e8693957ecfe193c1e737072ecd98045f","222e3b47ea76736f3f854db98e248fc29c39799a"],"title":"A powerful and efficient two-stage method for detecting gene-to-gene interactions in GWAS.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw060"}

A review of the literature reveals that four different methods have been proposed for detecting outliers in bioavailability/bioequivalence studies.

This model can be used for analysis of data in which subjects may be measured at many observations and interest is in modeling the mean and variance structure. In terms of the variance structure, covariates can by specified to have effects on both the between-subject and within-subject variances. Another use is for clustered data in which subjects are nested within clusters (e.g., clinics, hospitals, schools, etc.) and interest is in modeling the between-cluster and within-cluster variances in terms of covariates. MIXREGLS was written in Fortran and uses maximum likelihood estimation, utilizing both the EM algorithm and a Newton-Raphson solution. Estimation of the random effects is accomplished using empirical Bayes methods. Examples illustrating stand-alone usage and features of MIXREGLS are provided, as well as use via the SAS and R software packages.","inCitations":["cfc6a2afbc60ab75efabfff181ce3d8f04bc32cd","4bdceb8c276dfdac43f2b8c80208be8bc60b89b6","523b3eec1ff73040de49c3a601fcf3ec08f0090f","97e9f5b7ec50bb3a4bf24c4f7a1475e5c6bc64b8","fb21e433612f37656fa80c63a1abe36c20f48a67","a079ef91b65bbb1c355ffe12737026dcb3d82a60","72b50474b7235352c36fa3bdc7fab531612c7fd1","aaef3ce10711880649b9897343651965fd4d2a24","6dac5c578774d623e29f9a0fe7e7615fc7457b6c","09a131318e5f033cf69851c0fe615d54ed8d3367","d22039c056c965d310bb54e16e268c01e0f7523f","d7228dfcba550f61d38c48e20ee2411f1869c035","335a1413c5fdef15ceca9c682bdce05d57bc2efc","89786bcf7f690d29c71dcfa566c12cbee9b0fa6e","5c6a05d2a63be525d8017c2a356df94d4ec7123a","d265fa1d93f70c5d23f5e369c682cb3dc6073f23","61490618644e86a746b69bbfbda065ff8f58145a","27506ca4ecf19509502c11f0ea27ac3d7af1964d","7ef733022c4a70b5bfd5de6e6d81fbb13530130b","ba4bdae0cf4c749fabd2bc346a903e3c001e3e30","a5a78c422502f266f4dab3ed7d0227fae3e43d27"],"title":"MIXREGLS: A Program for Mixed-Effects Location Scale Analysis.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v052.i12"}

However, various biases could be introduced at every stage and into every aspect of the observational study, and consequently the interpretation of the resulting statistical inference would be of concern. While there do exist statistical techniques for addressing some of the challenging issues, often based on propensity score methodology, these statistical tools probably have not been as widely employed in prospectively designing observational studies as they should be. There are also times when they are implemented in an unscientific manner, such as performing propensity score model selection for a dataset involving outcome data in the same dataset, so that the integrity of observational study design and the interpretability of outcome analysis results could be compromised. In this paper, regulatory considerations on prospective study design using propensity scores are shared and illustrated with hypothetical examples.","inCitations":["185e98623654631cb95bfd97e1d6049e6f719799","c125cf014764202ed2e81259e4e1ae01d23750a1","21da580f1a446ae445677fb38eb87ed7fe80769c","c9c48cfbda15232793e585fd7c9a84c13dac0904"],"title":"Regulatory considerations in the design of comparative observational studies using propensity scores.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.715111"}
