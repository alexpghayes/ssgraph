In so doing, it is beneficial to estimate the common prior distribution of the latent ability from data. Full non-parametric ML (FNPML) estimation allows estimation of the latent distribution with maximum flexibility, as the distribution is modelled non-parametrically on a number of (freely moving) support points. It is generally assumed that EM estimation of the two-parameter logistic model is not influenced by initial values, but studies on this topic are unavailable. Therefore, the present study investigates the sensitivity to initial values in FNPML estimation. In contrast to the common assumption, initial values are found to have notable influence: for a standard convergence criterion, item discrimination and difficulty parameter estimates as well as item characteristic curve (ICC) recovery were influenced by initial values. For more stringent criteria, item parameter estimates were mainly influenced by the initial latent distribution, whilst ICC recovery was unaffected. The reason for this might be a flat surface of the log-likelihood function, which would necessitate setting a sufficiently tight convergence criterion for accurate recovery of item parameters.","inCitations":["a0029e5f095336fba90105332212947464426034","b2d47eaaf489e647f6f14ae54db487bbf8aea8db"],"title":"Sensitivity to initial values in full non-parametric maximum-likelihood estimation of the two-parameter logistic model.","doi":"10.1348/000711010X531957"}

For these methods to work reliably, estimated matrices must not only be invertible but also well-conditioned. The current paper introduces a novel prior to ensure a well-conditioned maximum a posteriori (MAP) covariance estimate. The prior shrinks the sample covariance estimator towards a stable target and leads to a MAP estimator that is consistent and asymptotically efficient. Thus, the MAP estimator gracefully transitions towards the sample covariance matrix as the number of samples grows relative to the number of covariates. The utility of the MAP estimator is demonstrated in two standard applications - discriminant analysis and EM clustering - in this sampling regime.","inCitations":["d25dd1c3ff492774e9379bdf51a343d6b025f3cb","0d1c774c5426ef1573192ada15d00f30b29996d2","17e0e926b35d2895ba9a0c84d2c37a4c02e1fe79","4f80d5337ddad41e3a176c5b571654fb8a7bf1ab","0371a1902c7a464738f4c090d2b5de984cd10d32","488355b9218649a36ea0fc8303696e383a3eb791"],"title":"Stable Estimation of a Covariance Matrix Guided by Nuclear Norm Penalties","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2014.06.018"}

However, non-linear relationships among the latent variables might be necessary in real applications. Methods for fitting models with non-linear latent terms have been developed mainly under the structural equation modelling approach. In this paper, we consider a latent variable model framework for mixed responses (metric and categorical) that allows inclusion of both non-linear latent and covariate effects.

Finally, a method for obtaining factor scores based on multiple imputation is proposed here for the non-linear model.","inCitations":["48edebbeb73c989b31b9447339ccc80ce0bddc6e","1a4cbdedc8f61cff4abd842300a982917c7c176f","75efdd955d5c6077087d009c1eb048430f54ac4e","e7ba411bac45494223ed3aee9f7bd647f473a83c","51583ce86ee391ce7024d3f920df6b10f172f520","528dd6f92c957da0afdae57f7ace688e591bc433","ad3f819b6356f9b5d29ab63ea779271ccec70575","f319498f05bd4f8169ad837bb026459fdae69a1d","e9aae0c329d7c295c86ea8766492e322df871d1f","e19dfe68f66d9f9439bd79de9d3ad9a4eb5a0572","8c354c77ba6f6b83d0dae3fff0962192ba509be5","bda07266186cf3eefce9754f4ba04f9d72f3c71e","3c9317fc20f119bd55d21ae99e578775ac03e756"],"title":"Generalized latent variable models with non-linear effects.","doi":"10.1348/000711007X213963"}

Past research has evaluated models of intertemporal choice by measuring goodness of fit or identifying which decision-making anomalies they can accommodate. An alternative criterion for model quality, which is partly antithetical to these standard criteria, is predictive accuracy. We used cross-validation to examine how well 10 models of intertemporal choice could predict behaviour in a 100-trial binary-decision task. Many models achieved the apparent ceiling of 85% accuracy, even with smaller training sets. When noise was added to the training set, however, a simple logistic-regression model we call the difference model performed particularly well. In many situations, between-model differences in predictive accuracy may be small, contrary to long-standing controversy over the modelling question in research on intertemporal choice, but the simplicity and robustness of the difference model recommend it to future use.","inCitations":["3216b84597f1da5c669fcd550b0171c65b28c630","f11a8d5212867dfa96d31b330dad5d44fa3cbf21","160549b46717c0f3f428c17243cf958edcd618a8"],"title":"The predictive accuracy of intertemporal-choice models.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12049"}

Regulatory efforts aimed at curbing PM levels in different countries often require high resolution space-time maps that can identify red-flag regions exceeding statutory concentration limits. Continuous spatio-temporal Gaussian Process (GP) models can deliver maps depicting predicted PM levels and quantify predictive uncertainty. However, GP-based approaches are usually thwarted by computational challenges posed by large datasets. We construct a novel class of scalable Dynamic Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (DNNGP) models that can provide a sparse approximation to any spatio-temporal GP (e.g., with nonseparable covariance structures). The DNNGP we develop here can be used as a sparsity-inducing prior for spatio-temporal random effects in any Bayesian hierarchical model to deliver full posterior inference. Storage and memory requirements for a DNNGP model are linear in the size of the dataset, thereby delivering massive scalability without sacrificing inferential richness. Extensive numerical studies reveal that the DNNGP provides substantially superior approximations to the underlying process than low-rank approximations. Finally, we use the DNNGP to analyze a massive air quality dataset to substantially improve predictions of PM levels across Europe in conjunction with the LOTOS-EUROS chemistry transport models (CTMs).","inCitations":["0b13a8da4d8bb49e03fe232f45c89fcc08deebfb","6d4f23beed757bdcbb639cc0247000648f5539b3","386ffc63a621ddd390ce9a71e99acdfb30f2faac","dc8febb8ba47c81b23ab5b1120c2851adf6783d5","1c981352a4a832588de48e0032ca5165a6987be8","d8593765299a2941a85733f77b5147f9808040c4","895da3bbb1e13a32ad7ebc15ed0c485e58dcfef2","2e00b945c8c2caf7e0e08ab9363b4e186bae173f","95c0ec4c631fc674cf14a34715f4de4837f3c7d0","f7d252d61b9fbabec2bfb5a9a91a0a28a8caf681","21ed43a12129e97aa92d4802d731d11e7779ed48","6ba095245ea864ea0910985cb12338cdab74d8da","34a8c2fe1a4b03482ef08cfa60a2fb94ceaf960e","a3e12c01661a710271531797dfd01b33ab4eae42","f62da4f3161681c311dc3a83038573d3549b941e","69e8329036d07e9cc9614a83859b1396556a6f56","78a347bd7dbf0b219727f60d803ae6780e06c50f","8d381a63294d39faff38bab716cea2a41dea6b17","4ac67e68094b526d949d75f5e878941d22d58bff","4763be87adb5d8ef0bf4001170ca179b5b38c19a","6d87617765fac50bc7136ebf8c7ce6e9d2db27ae","c8f15aa9ea9583dbcb18339cdae96e3e031428f1","0f470f408800a3387d49aada301b8f8cf300c602"],"title":"Nonseparable Dynamic Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process Models for Large Spatio-temporal Data with an Application to Particulate Matter Analysis.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS931"}

Features are binary variables that characterize the objects in an experiment, with some measure of proximity as response variable. Sometimes features are provided by theory and play an important role in the construction of the experimental conditions. In some research settings, the features are not known a priori. This paper shows how to generate features in this situation and how to select an adequate subset of features that takes into account a good compromise between model fit and model complexity, using a new version of least angle regression that restricts coefficients to be non-negative, called the Positive Lasso. It will be shown that features can be generated efficiently with Gray codes that are naturally linked to the FNMs. The model selection strategy makes use of the fact that FNM can be considered as univariate multiple regression model. A simulation study shows that the proposed strategy leads to satisfactory results if the number of objects is less than or equal to 22. If the number of objects is larger than 22, the number of features selected by our method exceeds the true number of features in some conditions.","inCitations":["06e05963f398d5e7f2ecbaed4d332538d0d8735d","10fed6f78a4f5331b87eba349a35463f87dd5e60","769139f6cc8e50b1ad426c1bf48a3332c86819fc","1c875e241d85cfb9509db2dccad4a23aa4417846"],"title":"Feature selection in feature network models: finding predictive subsets of features with the Positive Lasso.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X119365"}

The resulting test strategies can be visualized graphically and performed iteratively. We illustrate the methodology with two examples from our clinical trial practice. First, we consider a three-armed gold-standard trial with the option to reallocate patients to either the test drug or the active control group, while stopping the recruitment of patients to placebo, after having demonstrated superiority of the test drug over placebo at an interim analysis. Second, we consider a confirmatory two-stage adaptive design with treatment selection at interim.","inCitations":["920f3ea3416cac09ff6b70d01bac940a293d2846","4e17e5b4bf88b8410c4299a914e2e2f5ca475a1b","7208a0c4ab5e65c1ffa168dca813fdba28378968","c93d397707e6386e297a3a130168085b9d0fa2aa"],"title":"A simple and flexible graphical approach for adaptive group-sequential clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.972509"}

MCDA operates by mapping class labels to the vertices of a regular simplex. With c classes, these vertices are arranged on the surface of the unit sphere in c - 1 dimensional Euclidean space. Because all pairs of vertices are equidistant, the classes are treated symmetrically. To assign unlabeled cases to classes, the data is entered into a large matrix (cases along rows and predictors along columns) that is augmented by vertex coordinates stored in the last c - 1 columns. Once the matrix is constructed, its missing entries can be filled in by matrix completion. To carry out matrix completion, one minimizes a sum of squares plus a nuclear norm penalty. The simplest solution invokes an MM algorithm and singular value decomposition. Choice of the penalty tuning constant can be achieved by cross validation on randomly withheld case labels. Once the matrix is completed, an unlabeled case is assigned to the class vertex closest to the point deposited in its last c - 1 columns. A variety of examples drawn from the statistical literature demonstrate that MCDA is competitive on traditional problems and outperforms alternatives on large-scale problems.","inCitations":["d1d675060567205e3744595fbd81d06d201553fd","a025f74856e2b346f27445a0db115d8fbb725f4b","408ba80bc38dae9bd6058e88a9e1b7392a1036b4","121839d3254820b7017b07ef47acc89b975286a9"],"title":"Matrix completion discriminant analysis","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2015.06.006"}

However, when superiority claim of a new drug against the active control is unlikely to be successful, researchers often address the issue in terms of noninferiority (NI), provided the experimental drug demonstrates the evidence of other benefits beyond efficacy. Such trials aim to demonstrate that an experimental treatment is non-inferior to an existing comparator by not more than a pre-specified margin. The issue of choosing such a margin is complex. In this article, two-arm NI trials with binary outcomes are considered when margin is defined in terms of relative risk or odds ratio. A Frequentist test based on proposed NI margin is developed first. Since two-arm NI trials without placebo arm are dependent upon historical information, in order to make accurate and meaningful interpretation of their results, a Bayesian approach is developed next. Bayesian approach is flexible to incorporate the available information from the historical trial. The operating characteristics of the proposed methods are studied in terms of power and sample size for varying design factors. A clinical trial data is reanalyzed to study the properties of the proposed approach.","inCitations":["fa85261b87bda99883a8a4cbd6c5687b4940eadc"],"title":"Approaches for testing noninferiority in two-arm trials for risk ratio and odds ratio.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2019.1572616"}

In this paper, we consider a segmented line regression model with an unknown number of change-points and study asymptotic properties of Schwarz type criteria in selecting the number of change-points. Noticing the overestimating tendency of the traditional BIC observed in some empirical studies and being motivated by asymptotic behavior of the modified BIC proposed by Zhang and Siegmund (2007), we consider a variation of the Schwarz type criterion that applies a harsher penalty equivalent to the model with one additional unknown parameter per segment. For the segmented line regression model without the continuity constraint, we prove the consistency of the number of change-points selected by the criterion with such type of a modification and summarize the simulation results that support the consistency. Further simulations are conducted for the model with the continuity constraint, and we empirically observe that the asymptotic behavior of this modified version of BIC is comparable to that of the criterion proposed by Liu, Wu, and Zidek (1997).","inCitations":["6b9893b5cfc1705985ad5d54faee2e75d9c4e015","dd811531b29a3c53645b766ed0e9439f0205548d","72816408a8b14aef1458335a0f60d658a4681ad9"],"title":"Consistent Model Selection in Segmented Line Regression.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2015.09.008"}

In order to assess the present situation a survey has been conducted to identify the number of agencies employing one or more full time statisticians. Out of 29 responding agencies, 12 employed one or more statisticians on a full time basis, whereas 17 did not. Among these 17, 7 involved external experts on a regular basis, 5 involved external statisticians on a case-by-case basis, whereas 5 never involved external statistical expertise. Failure to involve statisticians in the assessment of efficacy and safety of medicines does not automatically lead to reports of low quality or invalid assessment of benefit-risk. However, in depth knowledge of statistical methodology is often necessary to uncover weaknesses and potentially biased efficacy estimates. This might be of importance for the final opinion on granting a marketing authorization, and statistical review should therefore be conducted by those who are professionally expert in the area. A positive trend toward an increased involvement of statistical expertise in the European network of regulatory agencies is observed.","inCitations":["31fe8f04b9fcd3a6aabccb761f663cf38dff44e8","39ea2aa3e28411a215429b5c50f697fdfe928fc1"],"title":"Statisticians in European regulatory agencies.","doi":"10.1002/pst.367"}

Using a hierarchical model for the hazard function, both timescales are incorporated via conditionally independent stochastic processes; smoothing of each process is specified via intrinsic conditional Gaussian autoregressions. Features of the corresponding posterior distribution are evaluated from draws obtained via a Metropolis-Hastings-Green algorithm.","inCitations":["8598d5ad3fea5cb59167ea8f2c5b17eae364ea54","e9dc2d53aebb5821c90cae42414e9fc9bb2612c8","cfb307cdb003c1efc46571e278bfa243e8634c55","5fb6bc9fbcb7cd2534056002b101c1fe3761f0b6"],"title":"The separation of timescales in Bayesian survival modeling of the time-varying effect of a time-dependent exposure.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm038"}

A disadvantage of a purely statistical measure is the difficulty in deciding the improvement in the measure that would make inclusion of the additional marker worthwhile. In contrast, a medical decision making approach can weigh the cost or harm of ascertaining an additional marker against the benefit of a higher true positive rate for a given false positive rate that may be associated with risk prediction involving the additional marker. An appealing form of the medical decision making approach involves the risk threshold, which is the risk at which the expected utility of treatment and no treatment is the same. In this framework, a readily interpretable evaluation of the net benefit of an additional marker is the test tradeoff corresponding to the risk threshold. The test tradeoff is the minimum number of tests for a new marker that need to be traded for a true positive to yield an increase in the net benefit of risk prediction with the additional marker. For a sensitivity analysis the test tradeoff is computed over multiple risk thresholds. This article updates the theory and estimation of the test tradeoff. An example is provided.","inCitations":["d33109060c614ecbefad077564b20e810bf08fff","c37d30f7162e7fec10a9bc3fd36277151c177c71","49298a3233aba90f1ab0122e3595e694f25be564","4b5ea96d8f02fc0b14e95f8c151f820c91f578ac","a85aa6289702315a8624fa716ee2a8441b67614a","8e1fb5dbf27c0fd8d19ad327df105e4cd3d6294f","f8a9cfe382a83b3b60f3dc73d3cba91818c5ecbe","ab38553205313c9b4769adac7cd3b1dbb8e59c5b","d36ed62947b6a85f22e0d25a6392d54139aee26f","040758a66642b700c28249b2b49ba70b8cdf797c","bf4e5a76f5fe59e39000fc9a172cb27d1948ac50","ca4f5ff6d16efc99b0a6776eec57532d26cfdd09","68e65ededda1aea3f17282b69cc5ec8982e3e1ab"],"title":"Evaluating a New Marker for Risk Prediction Using the Test Tradeoff: An Update","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1395"}

Additional factors such as period and sex should be included in the model as appropriate. Multiple pre-dose measurements can be averaged to obtain a pre-dose-averaged baseline and used in the model. We provide conditions under which the proposed model is more efficient than other models.

The model is based on a Poisson or negative binomial observation model with two components: a parameter-driven component relates the disease incidence to latent parameters describing endemic seasonal patterns, which are typical for infectious disease surveillance data. An observation-driven or epidemic component is modeled with an autoregression on the number of cases at the previous time points. The autoregressive parameter is allowed to change over time according to a Bayesian changepoint model with unknown number of changepoints. Parameter estimates are obtained through the Bayesian model averaging using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.

The results from Monte Carlo simulation study indicate that the proposed CIs perform well in maintaining the nominal coverage probability: for small to medium numbers of clusters, the intracluster correlation coefficient-adjusted McNemar statistic and its associated Wald or Score CIs are preferred; however, this statistic becomes conservative when the number of clusters is larger so that alternative statistics and their associated CIs are preferred.

To illustrate the practical application, a real clustered matched-pair collection of data is used to illustrate testing the difference of marginal probabilities and constructing the associated CIs.","inCitations":["acb600ae872d84ad30e541dca92111e7d6bd3cb7","55c3d6b1838ca979c1b8933fce15e25f8d7aa486","b22207579a94d558ed51b5379f3b885ed3ed752d"],"title":"Confidence intervals for the difference of marginal probabilities in clustered matched-pair binary data.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1523"}
