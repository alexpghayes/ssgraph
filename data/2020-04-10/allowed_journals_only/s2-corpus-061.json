One goal of microbiome study is to associate the microbiome composition with environmental covariates. We propose to model the taxa counts using a Dirichlet-multinomial (DM) regression model in order to account for overdispersion of observed counts. The DM regression model can be used for testing the association between taxa composition and covariates using the likelihood ratio test. However, when the number of the covariates is large, multiple testing can lead to loss of power. To deal with the high dimensionality of the problem, we develop a penalized likelihood approach to estimate the regression parameters and to select the variables by imposing a sparse group [Formula: see text] penalty to encourage both group-level and within-group sparsity. Such a variable selection procedure can lead to selection of the relevant covariates and their associated bacterial taxa. An efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. We present extensive simulations to demonstrate that the sparse DM regression can result in better identification of the microbiome-associated covariates than models that ignore overdispersion or only consider the proportions. We demonstrate the power of our method in an analysis of a data set evaluating the effects of nutrient intake on human gut microbiome composition. Our results have clearly shown that the nutrient intake is strongly associated with the human gut microbiome.","inCitations":["5e8530b5f2b947313e5a3c5c706163a153cf562c","470b1fcf2269626dfb8237b85862e4c7c69e4c33","a2f74b7c14e81474c7265aaf93a68971de69ad2d","54508713f4c4752bc761386c96170676ebd75d5d","bcb4efdaf254cf3e8bb2f36f7d399a4c5e46fb9a","d8c91231af7828fa47de5f7bdc2b54508cddc8ec","ab32b5c35065a2361155c2d37da3536e95bff64b","888a3f5e7ebdf5efb2c9998461715d7ce31dfe65","1116fbd784e20a032e90251ad34f7e5660df0ae9","3c5fd2921a1fa4b475f66fbec1e6bb58b1808bd8","d178b7d68d9b55a21710c27bdb4c1145be3c9e64","c2e335b9db587aeda86cc1c20558c98eda464453","4c5e74f37a47bac03abf56adc06c8e7f6f386e95","bbcc50de5aa45fb644dafb7a8a9bb8df352204a2","653b6f7c814b3f29fe048796f40e5fdadc2fd4b2","458ab585565c4b641a59890ef0fa413e66e508d2","112f855e82ecdfae133aa19e6637c5559085bd3d","ca7e78d8001d83e235907c3b3db19ce3627e644b","bd67404e2e31293cb13d9cfdd9b0aaf1b79a2831","716b177ee7fa983c24de6616bbfd880baefc910a","130f3af91acf636a72e4c1d2996c35d292305ba3","f0d3d18b9643c6ea8050bd98ebb9508b9d550d6b","aff1b345d3658bdf4fbccf15870c4f8900a21fc6","340663d0037eee32f638b99e1ab56109019165ab","c424d5b703ca312d79919c36f7e3b9632626798e","08c7ebde2c2bbb53093d7c5a456424443cb54b7d","71520a3d754e402fa4e47c92a6af49191e6b93a0","7406c62517857eb5476f9d29a1ef02ee02f2e57a","94c04e45c69e2c5c454e665669fd92675cc77671","d6c0e13a91f53befadabe67a6c8da7808d7931ac","27890aff4cf3cb0bc85900a8e8569fd792c1c4ac","a20d1f438d1bc2e2131ef965e0280acf5023d35d","117686b4e84614c60d372a1a028cbdb0c3f20311","bb1875b039d9a37a0113cf01bdd4ea957fb1c984","4f2e3b81324fcf571a927ba7f2638cd99f255de2","500c119f729da904ced407ead59cce0e58196893","0a2fc54bd3c670416bb88130579a6c04496a4325","688462593e334c09cc56f91f1e246897787b71d9","6cb0f8657c976ec3279a925f14d88503d6a200ab","64aca0e9107aaee8212e0cc0b5c9d671a0f7cdd9","7873f40150674f7ba98bebf5db0b77d31ae270b4","7abe9568568af32eb5b062f0e093eabee95ba465","b87fd5ab05149f42a56afae7811183901dc8dae8","7a0e5778cf8475f0217787b51c8a51c89d74946c","e8f7e7bb0cbbc9d590fa8c4828198d63793bcab7","47c76b75280a9f08109f2f53e390a21a7cadef26","2d11ec1adc267f71263d3ecaad7b3a02436affd4","d708571991b4dcf16909e8de51aa9b4c8fa26984","e5b5eeeda07b9e038b82c2ea8fa076d615deb3dd","50aeb2d1c34d62d08ef2fd6f2519dffc44447c2b","f32d757f38cf6b61c9259d8b2ea43edcbf251dc5","9cbd391a8c7b33cce6276eb98fdebe3f8058e26d","d5360338ade18d1a48dc0b899bae268dec89e5da","0371a1902c7a464738f4c090d2b5de984cd10d32","e1609bbb8cf163abcd08303556fd79b1b93d6c0e","b4d989c18850da725f7d80ccf95d20fa041de60f","80d5e73686350904575a6ff96b4625d0eee7627b","24fbd7bf0a4f543bcbaf1fe5b97d6399f65078ec","aa50e40bb21fbbd645303974eb84e320aa150104","c7471e6b08152c0087cd4e35b5f8705633b6851c","918b8013b97adaf1261cc5bca5044fab8127be25","0fa3900d26f50fc1a562fe48b246c71018cb466f","3cc8e1b4a17ecae94ef15a3bc5f00d888f372b5f","de8578bfb43861ce8b679f95952a03b567d8db9c","789e12a3119efcd9e5915d34cb1db19015716ea9","b5f0e4824fa598942859f64890d2520ff3eb6f30","1ef6ce234d8b42365d92e28be708958ea6c53dcb","7564a084b076bf1a705c71e8d9622830a75f8b05","80b7dd6b8129f312e85b3d0ed7c52583dbcabcab","f0a26317ac117eb7e594f0bdc4bb6b0fcd32d66d","065bae17830a6fc139aff0948a6b2914975a9947","3de7b65c92879384c36076930facf9de3efb4cfa","af741719135cd124243ce296ac52c87758fda71f","13003060861bde4cd7000692188a806b77e64fb4","62ac7491486cd7085dd88d0c7996db6f9186dd07","072b490733db8fb060963213966c786e9c00083d","c48bad1ede64bb1a17fc68e6c37f5fc2cfa6bf0c","97556d4893a58623c51f55754df9dff5214e9823","2599ce7ce52e9fa83a1653029dd9a70b3cf68459","09681d6e66919dfb1e845d2006b59c88b8d1f359","33cca2d2942176bc0dc07f15e39d0441997ba70b","f73fca3a80099dc649c81d9a59c995c315eaab6a","526bbcf5e47530f2e2ecd43db5f6fa054f96c9ca"],"title":"Variable Selection for Sparse Dirichlet-multinomial Regression with an Application to Microbiome Data Analysis.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS592"}

In this paper, the relations between GGMs and GMRFs are explored based on approximations of GMRFs by GGMs, and approximations of GGMs by GMRFs. Two new metrics of approximation are proposed: (i) the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy of spectral densities and (ii) the chi-squared distance between spectral densities. The distances between the spectral density functions of GGMs and GMRFs measured by these metrics are minimized to obtain the approximations of GGMs and GMRFs. The proposed methodologies are validated through several empirical studies. We compare the performance of our approach to other methods based on covariance functions, in terms of the average mean squared prediction error and also the computational time. A spatial analysis of a dataset on PM(2.5) collected in California is presented to illustrate the proposed method.","inCitations":["01541f67b536179be3449380a6f63acc9e3e05b9","363ac8aea766ad2991abf45a1c632fbcf1d49126","d1a075fd8a1fe7e77e38038b48630aa4203cfbf6","c441cc4f753efd5c85dcb7476e0df9b9696ebf2c","96d1e44f72cf0e16d0703d6ea69d6c3b6cfb57ef","94ebd172f2c2bd844cca32d3328b6183edc49e21","6a96336eb90d86f7f8e59bbd8a115666fd6c1704","bb22f7f5a7f8264e3bf16863619f177a0a3cdfb7","72238cddcddafbbff75d2e00b14a0e4a58278314","deaa1a1e54dedb802b770cb85ae07bbf5dbca88b","a6228f8daca4e78a4bf94a84a00474aeddf1e6da","4e2b3450d9579f3bc700403a4a0d89a56b361bc1","829d6194e29aa296dfa932bf49b1e702537be743","007f220dcd640277768e2b96f374d846172c3c28","8defeff62122ec37951a93c8bf200556e6671c24","0115a75b6ce5942bb481b474a5839bbc9c20e7c4","e000a0d449cdb422caf26ba5f1e0e27a0505e517","27d0e609ff8b4e3ddf00445526be3580bf7a7ae1","b3102aa8ac22ea06af72fa17165afb41ab7beffd","0ecc553b4280821e7cc89eabf7329e859f9ae235","b5dbc21c1162eea1ae1ea3eb40127e3081a139a7"],"title":"A comparative study of Gaussian geostatistical models and Gaussian Markov random field models1.","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2008.01.012"}

Based on such models, one can obtain estimates of the marginal mean outcome for the population under assignment to each treatment, by averaging the model-based predictions across the empirical distribution of the baseline covariates in the trial. We identify under what conditions such estimates are consistent, and in particular show that for canonical generalised linear models, the resulting estimates are always consistent. We show that a recently proposed variance estimator underestimates the variance of the estimator around the true marginal population mean when the baseline covariates are not fixed in repeated sampling and provide a simple adjustment to remedy this. We also describe an alternative semiparametric estimator, which is consistent even when the outcome regression model used is misspecified. The different estimators are compared through simulations and application to a recently conducted trial in asthma.","inCitations":["a832bf50c2beef0d04256b51513794822b3bb00e"],"title":"Covariate adjustment and estimation of mean response in randomised trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1880"}

This paper has two aims: first, we develop a model for such data in order to avoid ecological bias; second, we illustrate that modeling the exposure surface and estimating exposures may lead to bias in estimation of health effects. Design issues are also briefly considered, in particular the loss of information in moving from individual to ecological data, and the at-risk populations to consider in relation to the pollution monitor locations. The approach is investigated initially through simulations, and is then applied to a study of the association between mortality in those over 65 in the year 2000 and the previous year's SO2, in London. We conclude that the use of the proposed model can provide valid inference, but the use of estimated exposures should be carried out with great caution.","inCitations":["a157730fe7718bb73750aa371380856214731135","c44eb5bcb523ab44f3da5b384f5581621276e0bd","09bb47b66fde04fc56b46e907461f6f0bc7e0935","4042049258ea01ae4988d91a1cd53cb61f8af972","c026bbe9805e6296f1e50463b3a6a00c59fc46b1","75dc26a5a9f5717c47eb1265ecc40d07d720cc7f","8b515e6cde188b2cc222ff29cab8bb39bcc250ab","df8ef70a234a2e0f2d5ffae841595817bd5d6295","29a709d4851a9b02944a5d91f1981199fea34f9a","daa82c38354a1982fd3cc5ebdb687140c3d05033","7700190ed77117da00063e642c84ae05ae715a3a","9f74356337ca4def6072829a4cf8bf6a99b0a6dc","13019391e4b32401620cf6f8c9dc5e236bfdea89","2c9b9227c6248edbea9315a8557053997ca05eef","72bd98dccd49bef706944a4cff81de26922b59f5","e555c51ef59f42ef745e09ef760c8699448ba52c","6868b956e7a46ea8ddd90a777e3ba4b5cf30b017","b5a2f35f892b18dd522ad9c9235072d8436e01cb","094e0288f663ab0a2d31bfa33e7aa69fd7e44cbf","005eeb610b4c3a5a295b47df01ed0c380df3e512","f40febe152e3d38e8679c595a1d924992586cd21","21a4948c667890b49eed7df68559df922cfa6b26","3db03751c412b2513ec4a179d2708f53699d72e6","039b75e1c0e36d0f4603113b8a935e9050525392","b741302ce421957f59252855bbd3906a24283384","134a0acc32d906096cca498875941e44abde8211","ea0850804c9932100f7bfaff5e67638ae59a3ea3","1366c6ab3e08acb53403acdcd345269e509e0791","b546e1632b3cac4205ead6336d4ff7545fe85da3","1becd398c5000d5a48958d2fcb50f92be2593030","9e185eae5e28b84255ead2dfd730fc866dc4c220","92a300c9b78ee79ae40b49e95b58f8b8dad0738d","e6fb3dfa82c40a4a95be148d6581046e09fbc415","57cd57c2a2800292995817a865429c1415f21825","3f56180c4931cd6fdfa41d8b027189806bfe284b","e47ec1c66ef2b3c9eea74b795ee9273bc7ff1d0c","efaf93ec697e4620593be73eefcb49fb45017ceb","04e28cf9d5e9fa9707eb64d0371b69f65d083c31","f0aae9dbd70b018e0aba5bdee3ac1b691019c01a","ae506929828157c4ee053732c1f286e4cba164bd","38a7d1ed9fbc8e5cc6f21d4bf063c54e77bc9c65","505d2d954798ddcec06cb662c6da978f9c8ddd05","fa3ae1a12c8d398d200195d58143aa4006bbd7ef","32e1729b9eb77936f158599826f3886e56dc1d09","7badb61cc4e558c87048b6fe127433fc0976fb4b","e420e146a693955775c1ef7d889d189c03f3f64c","47ea8c820736a95f2f55f38976492b29530781f7","eda0e23db9718440b4f89670a59667db883a4379","b33fb294229fe499d2de3f956d67debf0a95facd","49a8cfc938998dbcbde129adf456f7c2209bb726","0e471022646748372800be966c1758e84cbb43e1","fffa0d0918311df898fe401c15d3706dbc707231","7f4052beb5808a90a11bb2ad2c7bc99368cf9679","deecbed170b4346f9c6b5d21511304ae3e383268","12b09106a4bc898130610fd7f0a9b3545d0e32f4","837cc897821c69e72cabadfa0f1c2ded03e4bdcc","5f458dc78f85c6df5fe8398df012cfc143429f75"],"title":"Health-exposure modeling and the ecological fallacy.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj017"}

Available methods often assume that genes are independent. However, genes are expected to function interactively and to form molecular modules to affect the phenotypes. In order to account for regulatory dependency among genes, we propose in this paper a network-based empirical Bayes method for analyzing genomic data in the framework of linear models, where the dependency of genes is modeled by a discrete Markov random field defined on a predefined biological network. This method provides a statistical framework for integrating the known biological network information into the analysis of genomic data. We present an iterated conditional mode algorithm for parameter estimation and for estimating the posterior probabilities using Gibbs sampling. We demonstrate the application of the proposed methods using simulations and analysis of a human brain aging microarray gene expression data set.","inCitations":["ac73d3374b463ff008b4e52d3959a8e0a441e496","01d8b1aa27e8debb6f9f4206237a7207953522e9","9df7be307c4d1f845792c96f7ebe319492d91274","c0e691074e12483027aab2b25a0e41022d8d4abf","cbda6578bf67dd91c03db8b00190a5cc3cbba158","83f4319287cf4befbf13e423a31c9ffbfdf0804c"],"title":"Network-based empirical Bayes methods for linear models with applications to genomic data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903572712"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2008,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Statistical analyses of two-year carcinogenicity data include tests for dose-response relationship (positive trend) among the increasing doses and pairwise comparisons of treated groups with control in tumor incidence by organ/tumor combination. There are two major concerns in analyzing carcinogenicity data, namely, adjustment for the difference in mortality due to drug toxicity and adjustment for the multiplicity due to multiple testing of trends and pairwise differences by organ tumor combination. A widely used method for testing dose-response relationship is the method suggested by Peto et al. (Peto test). The Peto test adjusts the mortality differences among treatment groups by partitioning the entire study period into several intervals, analyzing the data separately for each interval, and then combining them using the Mantel-Haenszel procedure. The denominator for the calculation of the proportion of tumor bearing animals is determined from the cause of death information tumor data. In later works, researchers have expressed concerns regarding the construction of suitable intervals for mortality adjustment. Also according to the opinion of many pathologists it is difficult to accurately specify retrospectively if a tumor is the real cause of death of an animal. This information may be imprecise. Hence, many times results of analysis using the Peto test are questioned due to the inaccurate cause of death information. An alternative to the Peto test was suggested by Bailer and Portier, popularly known as Poly-K test. Unlike the Peto test, this test does not need any arbitrary partitioning of the study period or the cause of death information. This test for trend in tumor incidence adjusts the differences in mortality among treatment groups by assigning a weight of less than one to an animal that died early without developing the tumor; and a weight of one to an animal that died with the tumor or survived to the end of the study. The sum of the assigned weights of animals in a treatment group is then used as the denominator for the calculation of proportion of tumor-bearing animals for the group. The less-than-one weight assigned to an animal is the fraction of the animal's surviving time in the study over the maximum time of the study with a power k. The power k of the fraction is determined by the distribution of tumor onset times of the tumor. The Poly-K test may have some advantages over the Peto test in the sense that it does not require the cause of death information, which is an essential part for the Peto test. However, the performance of the Poly-K test in controlling the false positive rate in comparison to the Peto test is unknown and of great interest in the regulatory environment. In this work the authors compared the overall false positive rates of the Peto and Poly-K tests using the Lin-Rahman multiple comparison adjustment based on some simulation results.","inCitations":["2975bbafad5e58b25dc4c9ad1daf185bcc3437a4","73d80c3aa61a6efa12d94322c1d9ba3b2226f6ed","39cb388513dafe13b80f1cc2d3e043b1493d1bd2","efd0696778c19146de9d154808b90c2b7f092eb3","a60a98cd05276b6441cee3af84e2a57bbfbed4bb"],"title":"A comparison of false positive rates of peto and poly-3 methods for long-term carcinogenicity data analysis using multiple comparison adjustment method suggested by Lin and Rahman.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802287628"}

In this article, we propose a new alternative empirical likelihood (EL) ratio approach for testing the equality of marginal distributions given that sampling is from a continuous bivariate population. We show that in various shift alternative scenarios the proposed exact test is superior to the classic nonparametric procedures, which may break down completely or are frequently inferior to the density-based EL ratio test. This is particularly true in the cases where there is a non-constant shift under the alternative or the data distributions are skewed. An extensive Monte Carlo study shows that the proposed test has excellent operating characteristics. We apply the density-based EL ratio test to analyze real data from two medical studies.","inCitations":["75f6da37e48a770c5a76c79b789b4f92e9d0da98","6e75b1c2faeff169ee3058e9e3737fc6469f06cf","8efd6f77f297b069c54707a81d1e3bba0a6d498d","82216e6dbbeefce691c137a295f2c6f0a4274571","0397d646dc8a11efab48ff9dcbbc02ab630d6b39","a1de278616eb6eb88275e750e95c23afe1de68c3"],"title":"An Exact Density-Based Empirical Likelihood Ratio Test for Paired Data.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2012.07.018"}

Subclasses that balance the inverse variance of the treatment effect reduce the mean squared error of the estimates and maximize the number of usable subclasses.","inCitations":["017f4c09389b3453a9a5a5f359524376c6a0fab1","f5236ce8add7920df5216ed3a6ffc5852666fd78","8bab54e34da91a0a2c1c28a63c23d82c50878d9e","dcf93925adc7c12a167912693ec8abc4ace26642","a1d1b9332871d147e15f82f1f7b4aa05816cc03a","6c1decca2a83644bb39e4d43d1fdf64215f5f303","70c5c114ace628888c298b580320cc7ffdbc69cb","d99e5e8c4e77a7fa92a3402961a740e4587ff23d","386aaea78e61ed2b5f37e6e4f1beca64cf54bb65","3220bfb829d61f47efe006eb70fde71d78f58a56","1b5de084c812ae9d3ed847decde791ad7e96c202","cf09fd251f7056db7bac09b46c6581d24a4512bf","eed5eafbefca3d3003d1f53fe3ca21c3366dc952","2eb322734d9ec70736309d02580e0620cfc1e874","497269e5b56c775c6a5b326cf463445db9c16802","69a20c42bb4c605f3885288170b731db0a1392b6","8182e684ffe729aef94afd70ac110b72bdde4520","dd83b7f9cabac1f5612ec222ac67cbda6e43cf9e","498f927da21ed375a043df33b9b33a39a9ec76a4","84f701c507fe115b9a9913a61cc534a6c6e4fafc","d5b2c4215844b265b761b1b44d985640ac5a0fca","5b92b59e158ed76e3efa4ace45ee55db1fc2a73c","c54462741da295db7f8fc2ed174d3d996d73a3d4","cccaa50d18bf88a9c1b8b0124415debe29073f22","49fc846323f22059cc63ba1f0bc6de3f4494d7e1","f957fe7a6acaa27d469691a8f35ee340b687d622","cd3e906385d392451de6dcc7c197c628299382fe","e8cffd8af0c86f70b2c80ec8921c6e48da1ea276","aa51b55e7f660db6858198840abd89d35ed8b5dc","0a96c0a4da7e0a9ab6e1072f762609434dbbf7e9","1e29dfbc0d51cdbc0c12347cca3716080c86fdd7","494b5557231666b73dfbd6c716ec7181b2df2942","f82892cd19daa608beaa796c9fd91ef589f40d4c","f33cc378857bf409b856ba726957b249d4fdd37f","58b2e66ec57af6fc90478be26c84a7b46aa6f628","d08b213729a115b9ee516a1ef9eaf61df35ff4ce","529480082ba1bb0dec2a66dcc85ae111e93e3707","3e9a0801bd1a6557a8e60e3ee457b66377ed4948","09585fe7ca929d2ffa982b49de6c6c4596a22449","189f1e39afd9384e7ded19d6e99758fe253fb42b","323d03bca842b2dc721ab44537f1c46c1e9db6c6","f25007026feb9d6b388ac526f95e38c331fb2348","36be328be4bd122d30d9f4a1dcd8b2bad4a6564d","f4e1a8e9180ba3dd14779c57995ce8323203baa8","150592416d0af5b7bd544a2a1e1ab42ffbeec9fb","45dfc58d52d83996a88aa26e2e8348838556506a","0e9abcef18bcc0ae2b1b8781d341ad862949e911","1f7dd02ed51c38d03af5b35178a0e204be3b1319","f434d40e8f5fbaeebaeec80b5e80066aeae2eeb1","018b373eadc594f1f7957c42098af31b81b303fb","c7a5ad1455e51978541a67a77450a5631f10b528","17a7613df8fb0b74a6cdbc81acb78f363a31adbd","cf77820cb39d04605670af18a6bd44a78ee208cb","fc84fad92a2b92c67a34c82fa2ea816f252bcbd5","2bc961d29582d0c9a75ead5530cbf1ebec8dfbb0","5e1500aa2fb8340b11b6accfb723a9b4c28bed38"],"title":"Propensity score modeling strategies for the causal analysis of observational data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.2.179"}

The present paper offers an overview of possible strategies for bootstrapping in PCA. A motivating example shows that CI estimates for the component loadings using different methods may diverge. We explain that this results from both differences in quality and in perspective on the rotational freedom of the population loadings. A comparative simulation study examines the quality of various estimated component loading CIs. The bootstrap approach is more flexible and generally yields better CIs than the asymptotic approach. However, in the case of a clear simple structure of varimax rotated loadings, one can be confident that the asymptotic estimates are reasonable as well.","inCitations":["f3b42ac48651afe7afd49efe48175a2e081b5f13","63d9fe967069763db5bb5f765ab673b613834767","da2e0e2cc92175f4f730b9bcc8d226bbc1575445","70b0fdbe95d981a2b1ba6c9ef4a3b9e3953e9a9c","dc62751cdedcbbd32a683d9eb2c943339c4184d0","ca0e525ea6435458630cbaf0cbdf3d1660fd695e","e032724d69222a57bf6d8bc0d8fec3d8e0b4f35e","e39a06ef08b19dda5f80f15844e9d705986b872b","d10dd1de036400ed2d660c76ad9dae34290bca52","709bae8387778fed35fb845c2313cf5d3152485d","70b881a22e1073acc074ba95d225591858f6bcc8","848bc1606b85ce075aef437e6682250eda075ef8","d9f755313ff55b66befe1a113975e30e1c6e0c8a","2fdad7104a302fde277f6c76b3d5a41eeaf393fe","c6eff72a13077e281b7e234d6b8afda2c5439859","365114c3e05e01405eac3cfbfe21e14df16f137d","6b9fcb09ac89f5beb0ebffc5c6b96cd1fbcf74ab","8cf24ae2da843c6ff25f1b80bd42cad568513488","e8c44148bf08cd335219e8f1574f9b07f5d62cbd","182ebb0accae659c034417df862148a655388d08","d8786d57dfa3747cd7c9b5482666333630756507","aee4533d1d2fdc5cec1458c577632eaf2584f256","b94296efba71046e2c4f2a0168d79408529d5bc3","78c2a503cce428082453fa186b2a20a41c9d75d7","48d513813936ea76a1900e931e87fbfcb8338b10","4abb8b75a38b2f13661c06f8c3a541163f6b91fa","904dcf92c601f81d06a4064662c928cb5c3e60d0","ed0341562cd512327156b06101ac8413547714ce","244b16a4bca45ff4dd8398c7a2d623fdb51768b4","43968b5816f02f109526c1751950202418878426","6537da674f4bbe7627d345dfa65054bc19d0c499","206d0d566114e816e7b7b0934afdfb95741e005e","e365b110808a2e310bf367ac5aae5d1a7a15d3bc","724126fdc211c96306d1c7e381fa9e2834dae981","7c61b692236bd34982bdc0a0ceceabfb3a919589","56028dc4d5b6c269e3de54361f36cd35fa2b13b2","4376bc3bcbbb82fc37e740f477b9fe4fc62cb287","0c9791cd7b63ffdb5f0bb2b7b80b98f36aec82d0","8a936d2e65ff17838fbb94c0ab76c153c1c61d2d"],"title":"Estimating confidence intervals for principal component loadings: a comparison between the bootstrap and asymptotic results.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X109636"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2009,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In preclinical solid tumor xenograft experiments, tumor response to cytotoxic agents is often assessed by tumor cell kill. Log10 cell kill (LCK) is commonly used to quantify the tumor cell kill in such experiments. For comparisons of antitumor activity between tumor lines, the LCK values are converted to an arbitrary rating; for example, the treatment effect is considered significant if the LCK > 0.7 (Corbett et al., 2003). The drawback of using such a predefined cutoff point is that it does not account for the true variation of the experiments. In this article, a nonparametric bootstrap percentile interval of the LCK is proposed. The cytotoxic treatment effect can be assessed by the confidence limits of the LCK. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to study the coverage probabilities of the proposed interval for small samples. Tumor xenograft data from a real experiment are analyzed to illustrate the proposed method.","inCitations":["f9ab521c9dfe75b1c8f1a718f1ac13ae7b0ce3e1","7c92d9aadf3f21585cf36fc342e3253c082ca2de","e1279114ec46880be04f2f57a4c14da731818903","af03e6d27aa6de4f25a20c38355ab419b9d24074","233a0eed4e3ae93cb5085778e7281cd3ffd88a73","bdadbf226235db7021bfef614668251f2f468ba6"],"title":"Assessing cytotoxic treatment effects in preclinical tumor xenograft models.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903105158"}

It is a fact that these coefficients occasionally yield unexpected results in situations known as the paradoxes of kappa. This paper explores the origin of these limitations, and introduces an alternative and more stable agreement coefficient referred to as the AC1 coefficient. Also proposed are new variance estimators for the multiple-rater generalized pi and AC1 statistics, whose validity does not depend upon the hypothesis of independence between raters. This is an improvement over existing alternative variances, which depend on the independence assumption. A Monte-Carlo simulation study demonstrates the validity of these variance estimators for confidence interval construction, and confirms the value of AC1 as an improved alternative to existing

There are different notation systems for these mean diameters, which may cause much confusion. This equally applies to their nomenclature. This article introduces the Moment-Ratio definition system and evaluates briefly the ISO definition system. The ISO system appears to have serious drawbacks. Mean particle diameters can be estimated from histograms of size distributions by Summation (M-R system) and by Integration (ISO system) over the histogram intervals. Summation tends to be more accurate than Integration and is less sensitive to low values of the lower limit of size distributions. The Summation method equations are straightforward and generally applicable. The mathematical formulas of the Integration method are difficult to apply in daily practice, and their complexity may easily hide the physical background of a mean particle diameter. A coherent nomenclature system for denoting mean particle diameters is recommended. This nomenclature system does not contain any ambiguities and clearly conveys the physical meanings of mean particle diameters. This article deals also with an empirical method to select the proper type of mean diameter to describe a physical, chemical, or physiological property of a product or material containing dispersed phases. After calculation of the mean diameters from experimental data, the relationships between the product property and these mean diameters are investigated statistically. The selection method has been illustrated by two examples. The dataset of each example consists of a set of particle size distributions and the corresponding physical product properties that are influenced by the particle sizes. Hypotheses are formulated to explain the types of selected mean diameters. Sharing results from all over the world of applications of the developed selection method will lead to a buildup of knowledge of physical meanings and application areas of the types of mean particle diameters, which will support decision making in product development.","inCitations":["d890415bced02e312f51efc23956e7a4e54c597b","29adcc4c7adba442152b0f4c4cfa457196b2a268","c72e883af8920b28103904738089bd51c0400ab2","61829acbfde20fa6a187e43084bcba2f6ee8c87e","5e358e26b99cf1b2a7174799e2d700bbde8418de","fb64210f8c23429802ca21b36c4e225ef69fa2a9"],"title":"Mean particle diameters.

One important use of such studies is for justifying a biowaiver for post-approval changes which requires establishing equivalence between the new and old product. We propose a statistically rigorous modeling approach for this purpose based on the estimation of what we refer to as the F2 parameter, an extension of the commonly used f2 statistic. A Bayesian test procedure is proposed in relation to a set of composite hypotheses that capture the similarity requirement on the absolute mean differences between test and reference dissolution profiles. Several examples are provided to illustrate the application. Results of our simulation study comparing the performance of f2 and the proposed method show that our Bayesian approach is comparable to or in many cases superior to the f2 statistic as a decision rule. Further useful extensions of the method, such as the use of continuous-time dissolution modeling, are considered.","inCitations":["fb60e290ad10033ac7c0bd40adc3d9c008c63287","7bad06d90e047a4419bcbadc8e2bdc7452fbcf65","76f3be76c9e58500890862fece9dd2bd8f24e1f3"],"title":"Dissolution curve comparisons through the F(2) parameter, a Bayesian extension of the f(2) statistic.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.971175"}

It provides an opportune area for the community of pharmaceutical statisticians to pursue. In this article, we highlight useful principles behind the application of M&S. We claim that M&S should be focussed on decisions, tailored to its purpose and based in applied sciences, not relying entirely on data-driven statistical analysis. Further, M&S should be a continuous process making use of diverse information sources and applying Bayesian and frequentist methodology, as appropriate. In addition to forming a basis for analysing decision options, M&S provides a framework that can facilitate communication between stakeholders. Besides the discussion on modelling philosophy, we also describe how standard simulation practice can be ineffective and how simulation efficiency can often be greatly improved.","inCitations":["0cee7f54d6d012c8103d35bfdfbf5d1b20b40a8e","fefdcbc8d7abd6a6c7e5feaec5876e4bfd2723b7","15518fd1b0d5dbec9636dee23b643f440cc5c7e0","718f016ba55ee7b5c05eb4ead89aad0333ce18ab","af411118c8998d13f9fbba7bf5706da9965b57ad","2330e070b4745712d2f63526a01f3808900350c1","269d0b06760e5a2d1f96e307fd1a963ebde39805"],"title":"Modelling and simulation in the pharmaceutical industry--some reflections.","doi":"10.1002/pst.523"}

Many standard modeling and data analysis methods use underlying assumptions (e.g. concerning the rate at which new cases of disease will occur) which are rarely challenged or tested in practice. To relax these assumptions, we develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach using Gaussian Processes, specifically to estimate the infection process. The methods are illustrated with both simulated and real data sets, the former illustrating that the methods can recover the true infection process quite well in practice, and the latter illustrating that the methods can be successfully applied in different settings.","inCitations":["a21be8afa172a6a699dda25b617378970fef76c7","47af185364b5933f850994b67e6f35118932ba2f","9de9239b15ba91af4a9f281e0e88ebb94d7fc0d7","e11d30e2cfdc62a073ad3e33f763d84ab2242902","5b994478490185bb0b7d5f4dda8b3af7327c0bd0","fa4c0136b5f96f629bab51b569a3eb4f24b0db0f","cad597d7919d00c1677be38edb3ec6a049a73138","029ec072ace1d487669a38629347fd141466dad7","bf6e612901646a67a2e900730f8eeb5726ae31f6"],"title":"Bayesian non-parametric inference for stochastic epidemic models using Gaussian Processes","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw011"}

Two-stage designs allow to stop early for efficacy or futility and can offer the additional opportunity to enrich the study population to a specific patient subgroup after an interim analysis. This study compared sample size requirements for fixed parallel group, group sequential, and adaptive selection designs with equal overall power and control of the family-wise type I error rate. The designs were evaluated across scenarios that defined the effect sizes in the marker positive and marker negative subgroups and the prevalence of marker positive patients in the overall study population. Effect sizes were chosen to reflect realistic planning scenarios, where at least some effect is present in the marker negative subgroup. In addition, scenarios were considered in which the assumed 'true' subgroup effects (i.e., the postulated effects) differed from those hypothesized at the planning stage. As expected, both two-stage designs generally required fewer patients than a fixed parallel group design, and the advantage increased as the difference between subgroups increased. The adaptive selection design added little further reduction in sample size, as compared with the group sequential design, when the postulated effect sizes were equal to those hypothesized at the planning stage. However, when the postulated effects deviated strongly in favor of enrichment, the comparative advantage of the adaptive selection design increased, which precisely reflects the adaptive nature of the design.","inCitations":["3a1c62946a1ca57fc0e96cb701e061614d347fa5","76a909b5b7f440c1db47c9fa41a23b34fab80c19","22c3f405dd233bc886de71148b52dbb24454d9db","2d978be4ab99b4924083de721f9e81ee71c212e2","b1afc0437435bab5b3ef9025dbc044468368f748","9ffa0ae498e6ad395b4f8a6b7ffcbd0020cfcb90","f7d726451029f8717100cd6119f9ad328b4cd173","fa7b5372cb82a8507d26f42208c1fbbdcb60fe87"],"title":"Optimizing trial design in pharmacogenetics research: comparing a fixed parallel group, group sequential, and adaptive selection design on sample size requirements.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1599"}

However, to apply overall results to a specific region, the result in that region should be consistent with either the overall results or the results of other regions. This article discusses methods of sample size allocation to regions by introducing statistical criteria for consistency between regional and overall results. Specifically, three rules of sample size allocation are discussed: (1) allocating equal size to all regions, (2) minimizing total sample size, and (3) minimizing the sample size of a specific region. Some total and regional sample sizes calculated under each allocation rule are illustrated.","inCitations":["e241c9719f9e052d29eef8b3e90ae11b62f6a5c5","f3bd0949121b635446339f90eda1449c971faadc","cc738e36bd4663b0b2d794147f2d99b3f4accb85","a146dad1cf294f3445f4f400bd251e22512a42e5","69449fad26098b3d3b49c2bf6fa9918c261a6d96","349c39bca8463f1f768e6cd50e2fac66348923b6","01acaeb9f9c665b4900fbbb4b678561cc6f63f64","43263dda5943b4e9e086c10425ecada9c55883e2","970ec0b3d2cf661fbaa3451b4a93c1fad70bf88c","f2d50a09e063f9de6ca2b1e1c45fb17e5ce3d8a4","b12dc3f2ba8fa678e9096d87df132e4562cfeadc","6ea0386a2e635cac2f5b2e0015047cc809c0b47c","887179ac6b0293994bbc252d754175a0b0fc4b7a","06baf9b5828d468b441c79804dddd1950e25717e","500653e6a559079a5aa52883f3532562be77b66d","a687d4533aa5a86c6ae082b6946e98b896522182","bd9fe85bc17160b9b34f3efd7f1b60f9e85a1ae9","3b6f84334278e756acbc2e8cc91c14008116a798","2f67827aaf5491361944392064385f79255182d1","b9a80b945833aaa1b28ad1c407c28735d6d815ac"],"title":"Sample size allocation to regions in a multiregional trial.","doi":"10.1080/10543400902963185"}
