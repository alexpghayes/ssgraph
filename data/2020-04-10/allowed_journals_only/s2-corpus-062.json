Extensions of standard binary classification measures like time-dependent sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves have been developed in this context (Heagerty, P.Â J., and others, 2000. Time-dependent ROC curves for censored survival data and a diagnostic marker. Biometrics 56, 337-344). We propose a direct, non-parametric method to estimate the time-dependent Area under the curve (AUC) which we refer to as the weighted mean rank (WMR) estimator. The proposed estimator performs well relative to the semi-parametric AUC curve estimator of Heagerty and Zheng (2005. Survival model predictive accuracy and ROC curves. Biometrics 61, 92-105). We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and show that the accuracy of markers can be compared very simply using the difference in the WMR statistics. Estimators of pointwise standard errors are provided.","inCitations":["d11f6ed5626f28f5f3924c5ee23d79f15356e238","7d2550cb2cb27023b99539dd65445ee421d30165","1ae2514cf56ad9a965b34a69a8ccd938da438a76","ddc14a6589c68a4ff2e11b160e448cc916558d93","304c41a7e0a9cdce92c3fb65b2a8153de099b10e","f9affb008baf71f71cd724c9bd92ae25268a525d","75123ed6976eb286f73919fc9cbcaf9d43805752","20356a4fd241dfaf38a179d23b868cfadcb264e5","5e5fde7ba0728c52c77ded5d7653eb7f152881e1","011c1146bc9b239ab76548db268c540d399a4804","6393b690d4cfb0b4c72c38db30a6a1bbe7a97226","4c595cfc6a5923ffac92dbbbcb91263c94b0eb70","f355c869aa5140eafbbbb768b4641229b841c809","5ed47caf42ceccae0c0720af66a0e8aa8f900cdc","4ea2d42db58f41d66890b33df4314396e4c1feed","23017352d2f74ff6dfb454c205b08a56171c175d","2c2fcb5f4f41272e3d15ffcf0bf5446da2297a48"],"title":"Non-parametric estimation of a time-dependent predictive accuracy curve.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs021"}

A 4-year vaccine efficacy trial was planned to compare a high-dose vaccine with a standard dose vaccine. Subjects would be randomized each year, and subjects who had participated in a previous year would be allowed to re-enroll in a subsequent year and would be re-randomized. A question of interest is whether positive correlation between observations on subjects who re-enrolled would inflate the variance of test statistics. The effect of re-enrollment and correlation on type 1 error in a 4-year trial is investigated by simulation. As conducted, the trial met its power requirements after two years. Subjects therefore included some who participated for a single year and others who participated in both years. Those who participated in both years constituted a complete two-period design. An algebraic expression for the variance of the treatment difference in a complete two-period design is derived. It is shown that under a 'no difference' null, correlation does not result in variance inflation in this design. When there is a treatment difference, there is variance inflation but it is small. In the vaccine efficacy trial, the effect of correlation on the statistical inference was negligible.","inCitations":["9d5faf770785d6ed4d5836ef3f05b0cab7fe6879","80fb5733d841062a4a4680f3f0a31eade34060ba","04a632abbf7c36ce0c98679feb92ef294b84ebc1","80742be6fef1136a5e5ea85570aabd7b4a46bb5f","79ede2327e887d255ace57145384748f7d72292e"],"title":"Control of type 1 error in a hybrid complete two-period vaccine efficacy trial.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1649"}

A consequence is that model selection becomes a problem. It has been suggested that a way out of this problem is the use of the parametric bootstrap. In this paper, the parametric bootstrap goodness-of-fit test is studied by means of an extensive simulation study; the Type I error rates and power of this test are studied under several conditions of sparseness. In the presence of sparseness, models were used that were likely to violate the regularity conditions. Besides bootstrapping the goodness-of-fit usually used (full information statistics), corrected versions of these statistics and a limited information statistic are bootstrapped. These bootstrap tests were also compared to an asymptotic test using limited information. Results indicate that bootstrapping the usual statistics fails because these tests are too liberal, and that bootstrapping or asymptotically testing the limited information statistic works better with respect to Type I error and outperforms the other statistics by far in terms of statistical power. The properties of all tests are illustrated using categorical Markov models.","inCitations":["b8137a58732bed2d3f8d5a4ce4fede6b73084625","7a8c2275a01b705bf51a6bda2bda33d9789f6623","188badff09ec9c84cf8074e6c340d54f9a9ae81d","bcdc14a04be32faf957b7cee4cb1f2b0c522851f","2128f2a25222ece524b786e882c717dd24cfcc07","169a7b6d14b293f5eaccb8b024055a19c6160c4e","cc1100df18cfd1f809507a0d71440b9897519e90","ebe0d6e6454d753a23d2ab150cf2ff8e01fe0747","7a3d0906a22b2032dfbbc3a79a8695c160add596","2fd3a42fd1019364c4d673fbebf931a0187995e4","16c60282c2e060cc27660f8ff90f79b2b16f5928","80419ea238f56bd3b2aafdca563e1d06a488ad99","861009d1853d4751f1c01657538e9558c47418b5","6bafa7cd1ab62cc1affead6d5a8026487d0fcaa0","d7523c07e99daa42a06088413bcd86fdb02aa783","8d170ee1242116b4f51cf3fb712e2394ecd5de0a","3df62cd473fc023a071f5d45aea254367f6acd39","1c39cb5e65d58dbcc89ed792201f23f05b768d5a","c25a2505b191bf6a1877c10ec6eb3ae358e81cc3","92130d9807ce48f12d696dbd248a351645687e10","d6aa775e5711f3f587f6a46df44cae8a71018a8a","a75908cea4cd2dc672fae0685841b95c79560786","8359ea1ac24bbd3a68881b50b81ded4c99e8fb95","5db3b627ced004d284878fcb41c8204708ae470b","9c5f3bd655ec3e76c13ce8c31910209fb49314b9","6e8a8bbe1bbd1d17b2d8e11d1a944feceb41c0a1"],"title":"Type I errors and power of the parametric bootstrap goodness-of-fit test: full and limited information.","doi":"10.1348/000711003770480048"}

A similar situation also exists in the extreme phenotype sequencing (EPS) designs, which is to select subjects with extreme values of continuous primary phenotype for sequencing. EPS designs are commonly used in modern epidemiological and clinical studies such as the well-known National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project. Although naÃ¯ve generalized regression or ST$_{\\text{CC}}$ method could be applied, their validity is questionable due to difference in statistical designs. Herein, we propose a general prospective likelihood framework to perform association testing for binary and continuous STs under EPS designs (STEPS), which can also incorporate covariates and interaction terms. We provide a computationally efficient and robust algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates. We also present two empirical mathematical formulas for power/sample size calculations to facilitate planning of binary/continuous STs association analyses under EPS designs. Extensive simulations and application to a genome-wide association study of benign ethnic neutropenia under an EPS design demonstrate the superiority of STEPS over all its alternatives above.","inCitations":["b77ef29b01ff3f044d8c0586e01856bbcb4ff2d4"],"title":"STEPS: an efficient prospective likelihood approach to genetic association analyses of secondary traits in extreme phenotype sequencing.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy030"}

Statistical analysis of such associations is complicated by the multivariate nature of the pollutant exposure data as well as the spatial misalignment that arises from the fact that exposure data are collected at regulatory monitoring network locations distinct from cohort locations. We present a novel clustering approach for addressing this challenge. Specifically, we present a method that uses geographic covariate information to cluster multi-pollutant observations and predict cluster membership at cohort locations. Our predictive k-means procedure identifies centers using a mixture model and is followed by multi-class spatial prediction. In simulations, we demonstrate that predictive k-means can reduce misclassification error by over 50% compared to ordinary k-means, with minimal loss in cluster representativeness. The improved prediction accuracy results in large gains of 30% or more in power for detecting effect modification by cluster in a simulated health analysis. In an analysis of the NIEHS Sister Study cohort using predictive k-means, we find that the association between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and long-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure varies significantly between different clusters of PM2.5 component profiles.

Using DTI, the local fiber orientation in each image voxel can be described by a diffusion tensor which is constructed from local measurements of diffusion coefficients along several directions. The measured diffusion coefficients and thereby the diffusion tensors are subject to noise, leading to possibly flawed representations of the 3-dimensional (3D) fiber bundles. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian procedure for regularizing the diffusion tensor field, fully utilizing the available 3D information of fiber orientation.

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Hierarchical models are widely-used to characterize the performance of individual healthcare providers. However, little attention has been devoted to system-wide performance evaluations, the goals of which include identifying extreme (e.g., top 10%) provider performance and developing statistical benchmarks to define high-quality care. Obtaining optimal estimates of these quantities requires estimating the empirical distribution function (EDF) of provider-specific parameters that generate the dataset under consideration. However, the difficulty of obtaining uncertainty bounds for a square-error loss minimizing EDF estimate has hindered its use in system-wide performance evaluations. We therefore develop and study a percentile-based EDF estimate for univariate provider-specific parameters. We compute order statistics of samples drawn from the posterior distribution of provider-specific parameters to obtain relevant uncertainty assessments of an EDF estimate and its features, such as thresholds and percentiles. We apply our method to data from the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Program, a health insurance program for people with irreversible kidney failure. We highlight the risk of misclassifying providers as exceptionally good or poor performers when uncertainty in statistical benchmark estimates is ignored. Given the high stakes of performance evaluations, statistical benchmarks should be accompanied by precision estimates.","inCitations":["9493c6e4be1d29eaff0b53569cbe9780f41e96b8","a1a92dd0742fd3f9a0a30158264cbea8be6177a6","b63b551c883c815ca47a05e98686e87b8bb66700","bec5c7dc069c5a4f660fd63caa469f96dd76fea9","0c3b92d2d8b87a816d739a9f191c8205b41a6487","a138c82e767f33ea785ab372e71c9fcf1e03075e","750b67134b64fecb5966e7de9674dca0948d522c","9c6e2e63ebc562d2769b4e5d89f3afe8fdce5613","2fc4f2b6dbe1a76ad09f24455f58502989536278","912f3158f057975aa0a805ea94fd70f511b7fa24"],"title":"Percentile-based Empirical Distribution Function Estimates for Performance Evaluation of Healthcare Providers.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00760.x"}

The odds ratio is a popular concept for biomedical practitioners; hence, odds-ratio-based adaptive designs could be very useful in practice. Rosenberger et al. (2001) introduced an odds-ratio-based two-treatment response-adaptive design; however, they did not study the properties in details. In this article, we describe these designs by means of urn models and provide limiting results for them. Some properties of the design are also studied numerically. We compare the performance of the proposed design with some possible competitors with respect to a few criteria. A real dataset is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed design. Thus, we provide a base for using odds-ratio-based response-adaptive designs in practice. We extend our design for covariates and also for more than two treatments. In particular, we study the three-treatment design in this article.","inCitations":["5cf6d63f4e168ac404752b493579aa13ce7852d5"],"title":"An urn model for odds-ratio-based response-adaptive phase III clinical trials for two or more treatments.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903105331"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Computer Science"],"year":2018,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of statistical software","paperAbstract":"Estimating the causal treatment effect of an intervention using observational data is difficult due to unmeasured confounders. Many analysts use instrumental variables (IVs) to introduce a randomizing element to observational data analysis, potentially reducing bias created by unobserved confounders. Several persistent problems in the field have served as limitations to IV analyses, particularly the prevalence of \"weak\" IVs, or instrumental variables that do not effectively randomize individuals to the intervention or control group (leading to biased and unstable treatment effect estimates), as well as IV-based estimates being highly model dependent, requiring parametric adjustment for measured confounders, and often having high mean squared errors in the estimated causal effects. To overcome these problems, the study design method of \"near-far matching\" has been devised, which \"filters\" data from a cohort by simultaneously matching individuals within the cohort to be \"near\" (similar) on measured confounders and \"far\" (different) on levels of an IV. To facilitate the application of near-far matching to analytical problems, we introduce the R package nearfar and illustrate its application to both a classical example and a simulated dataset. We illustrate how the package can be used to \"strengthen\" a weak IV by adjusting the \"near-ness\" and \"far-ness\" of a match, reduce model dependency, enable nonparametric adjustment for measured confounders, and lower mean squared error in estimated causal effects. We additionally illustrate how to utilize the nearfar package when analyzing either continuous or binary treatments, how to prioritize variables in the match, and how to calculate F statistics of IV strength with or without adjustment for measured confounders.","inCitations":["4d678309ef2c4bc29c1c93359c08927089d40a63","ad6651065cac96f50c720b1462ea2dd52178c602"],"title":"Near-Far Matching in R: The nearfar Package.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v086.c05"}

Multivariate normal distributions are typically used. The number of clusters is usually determined from the data, often using BIC. In practice, however, individual clusters can be poorly fitted by Gaussian distributions, and in that case model-based clustering tends to represent one non-Gaussian cluster by a mixture of two or more Gaussian distributions. If the number of mixture components is interpreted as the number of clusters, this can lead to overestimation of the number of clusters. This is because BIC selects the number of mixture components needed to provide a good approximation to the density, rather than the number of clusters as such. We propose first selecting the total number of Gaussian mixture components, K, using BIC and then combining them hierarchically according to an entropy criterion. This yields a unique soft clustering for each number of clusters less than or equal to K. These clusterings can be compared on substantive grounds, and we also describe an automatic way of selecting the number of clusters via a piecewise linear regression fit to the rescaled entropy plot.

The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc), and the hypothesis of interest is the noninferiority of drug to placebo. Sometimes, due to the properties of the compound, it becomes necessary to use parallel group designs for TQT studies. In such situations, the effect of the baseline on the change from baseline in QTc becomes an important issue because differing baseline between the drug and placebo groups may not allow for proper estimation of the drug's effect. In this work, we evaluate the effect of baseline on the change from baseline using the placebo data from several TQT studies. Resampling techniques are used to evaluate the impact of differing baselines across groups.","inCitations":["dff4d13fb4b10fd2e8b212e667f5021a4150b925"],"title":"Effect of baseline measurement on the change from baseline in QTc intervals.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802005905"}

I here contrast the rationale and performance of several corrections, specifically those that generalize easily to multiple conditional logistic regression. These corrections or Bayesian analyses with informative priors may serve as diagnostics for small-sample problems. Points are illustrated with a small exact performance comparison and with an example from a study of electrical wiring and childhood leukemia. The former comparison suggests that small-sample bias may be more prevalent than commonly realized.","inCitations":["8bba80e22ccf0ec48cf84875b19ab1588ec1b1b0","be8b63dc3c37b53ceb7447e60a1556ec9cda023f","9ce192cd94a6febc15e7648c4962ca9bceefe747","fbdde4c50f036c00eda057d0eb173cd691bd3cc5","c7facfdbd3d4fbc458f8fa1c8ed276136bb4365f","7d9a674918c32491f23868cc8fc6f98dee973278","f92bb0c8bf3497dd8fd6ee580d09144cc0ad5f97","b9675425d0f38af750641a130671f8cb10f9b260","969a64e61f2e14c50f975ae1094a089e83fac85b","623a47b58ba669d278398d43352e4624a998d10d","1293a804ad71df1f55b014344beaf47df93b8482","03dca4af128d1d0a42c4db08d5393fe84d5afab3","8f23cff4419225b03d1f765fd7ea1f52eb51eb37","4782418a03e84074f717e8bd2e9ee7af95f1bfef","e32bdd85b0dbcff57196e1468687a09e96fc45dc","82349055ac661cb6ef5893a83194e436d2cf584d","a42dbb139fa07dace6eabd60e5ce1b1e143cf397","d77b8e70803288bf4e003626f3a354e12540565c","8db85987777d395b33ec98ccdb8ae30bf8e267a6","fc503ce2d73711e7b00854845a785b4ed20cc122","775a9730f374cc8f252da343a565da11dcc35ee0","fcd6a96d1b011470ec1e28cd4ca2e6e712603718","916449ed3d47c205b60f6222b32b9d224e01fbaf","e7cad4024f2593e164b64b78d424794408120e31","e149b7b691c50943eae28b76790024236f289803","dc07e9dc252252b00f1933b1e0a374e41ad06f69","63eff6f2f781e65cafab9afb798b6ea0552d97ab","bbdf501e1c0bb3fb5d6480eded24728a78449a38","1d3f98419cd28dadea7970ee7bc2c4f8574d2f32","2634c44f193fdad218df725233fd706d3dd20a9e","ea7dfcac97338f425d3ef354ce7c6ab32d79ede5","46255a9c1d53040ffb01741a01088a4fea12a5b0","8e6ea7b70c36029cf72cec7de69893bf0831ce60","455927e373d9bc7eaaf2202b6f6f3bf5a7f3d5da","74baf69bfa13b17d8b11df6a37d7bdf186e15f13","222336556285075fd115f70b9419de8df13da7f7","2a6104ae5a319833806e8e5b3563b2d5ba52dad6","eceba3f2c4020693dfe9af7643cd0221436f00e9","54d1eac3b90cedc952a2f28bfdd4948d31ec5bbe","54f355167c8adf15fe973c9b208858c0665a572b","e2dd7acdd8a39d359066c5799cbb5363a5b51ad1","c4e8ca1586c917f9df0c7b51a9bb35aa7311cdf1"],"title":"Small-sample bias and corrections for conditional maximum-likelihood odds-ratio estimators.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.1.113"}

Computational statistics","paperAbstract":"Internet usage and accessibility has grown at a staggering rate, influencing technology use for healthcare purposes. The amount of health information technology (Health IT) available through the Internet is immeasurable and growing daily. Health IT is now seen as a fundamental aspect of patient care as it stimulates patient engagement and encourages personal health management. It is increasingly important to understand consumer health IT patterns including who is using specific technologies, how technologies are accessed, factors associated with use, and perceived benefits. To fully uncover consumer patterns it is imperative to recognize common barriers and which groups they disproportionately affect. Finally, exploring future demand and predictions will expose significant opportunities for health IT. The most frequently used health information technologies by consumers are gathering information online, mobile health (mHealth) technologies, and personal health records (PHRs). Gathering health information online is the favored pathway for healthcare consumers as it is used by more consumers and more frequently than any other technology. In regard to mHealth technologies, minority Americans, compared with White Americans utilize social media, mobile Internet, and mobile applications more frequently. Consumers believe PHRs are the most beneficial health IT. PHR usage is increasing rapidly due to PHR integration with provider health systems and health insurance plans. Key issues that have to be explicitly addressed in health IT are privacy and security concerns, health literacy, unawareness, and usability. Privacy and security concerns are rated the number one reason for the slow rate of health IT adoption.","inCitations":["c0af2ba122f39e1a040b754f6c34ef519678a52d","5b6ad34349c0dbf4099ed1a8eb830aa080f0f600","4c55d6c9ae2fbfdfab70b77d4b2d2db48554e52c","2a577f227d0f0410ec24ee8f53671eda5b1a4953","5f8f16cb405263bb488dbc70a4b859eeb452cccc","45aa42b793ed470b676bae88fa8ca90aa8b9b4c3","75039505fd2ae925da0cd5d1d42cbba91e1e97f0","9c4cfcaed77d81a1e324fbac54d7a62384539618","8313a42bcf176750d9e406f20e50dacaef7192f9","7d61195b1eeb1c77b3ccca54f7155d629c46b343","6cac93080767e752590b1e79d4474037a4b08b5e","b4ece7af3680ebb3255a3f681b28b88f9f6eb8b4","5a8c705d7d673c3cf9e26a053c5723b182bc81c2","3e1ac56cb364005ef292686ffd8f9defcc94d416","b1bceb69dcec7de1cd2e217f1dfc8b04bdae5895","bf6309e17970a25f4aecedf7c1f16230b73c08cb","2cb729c0121fe205a82b65bc3e07f32b65324973","4c4d0bd34f18ac0598346ccc6fdf0056dc5bff87","f22c8e7c84af97dad4caaf64b262b344662511d3"],"title":"Uncovering patterns of technology use in consumer health informatics.","doi":"10.1002/wics.1276"}

The main difference between APISTA and the path-following iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (PISTA) is that APISTA exploits an additional coordinate descent subroutine to boost the computational performance. Such a modification, though simple, has profound impact: APISTA not only enjoys the same theoretical guarantee as that of PISTA, i.e., APISTA attains a linear rate of convergence to a unique sparse local optimum with good statistical properties, but also significantly outperforms PISTA in empirical benchmarks. As an application, we apply APISTA to solve a family of nonconvex optimization problems motivated by estimating sparse semiparametric graphical models. APISTA allows us to obtain new statistical recovery results which do not exist in the existing literature. Thorough numerical results are provided to back up our theory.","inCitations":["e57ed0a57896a1d504308c78bea4adc2f9c9c1a7","486956c45fa19b2d0d794501ec296f607ed1eeb5","c8a78c74d4a4ff2c4128d5f8e8843938445314e2","5d4b71408a79c6780c5e238c871d431504425195"],"title":"Accelerated Path-following Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm with Application to Semiparametric Graph Estimation.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2016.1164533"}

The inferential agenda covers collection of evidence about superiority, non-inferiority and average bioequivalence of the treatments. The proposed approach requires defining the terms 'small' and 'large' to qualify the magnitude of the treatment effect and specifying the losses (or loss functions) that quantify the consequences of the incorrect conclusions. We argue that any analysis that ignores these two inputs is deficient, and so is any ad hoc way of taking them into account.

We considered disease outbreaks in a setting with dense genomic sampling, and formulated stochastic epidemic models to investigate person-to-person transmission, based on observed genomic and epidemiological data. We constructed models in which the genetic distance between sampled genotypes depends on the epidemiological relationship between the hosts. A data augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to sample over the transmission trees, providing a posterior probability for any given transmission route. We investigated the predictive performance of our methodology using simulated data, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity, particularly for rapidly mutating pathogens with low transmissibility. We then analyzed data collected during an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a hospital, identifying probable transmission routes and estimating epidemiological parameters. Our approach overcomes limitations of previous methods, providing a framework with the flexibility to allow for unobserved infection times, multiple independent introductions of the pathogen, and within-host genetic diversity, as well as allowing forward simulation.","inCitations":["24899897a4a5e6b3b7a3000c08383cb618d0948a","eff6b56d7c8475cd2f8e47c15a88e09186ba346c","aa23231ee06c7d9afeae037e8a698044e3319648","d486d51868e8d420880e5f21ae906a5150642763","06f313a9f2481ec22ae3992381bb849e9415ab69","9d7cf63935101081c93ce4a8fb4d3628d9d689de","0b488972edb5453d7d175cba1aa780ee34bab6cf","64e763067bfad6ddea783cf62165bddf6f7a6226","bbfd13f813434a68f4f76e8d572972d5dfa0760b","6bab4906b227f212a77224c67bbd6f2c939c65e4","572e415852cc3f0ab83be1b3e45b89b2c7e945d0","436720591e5fcbc4d6747ba75e86cb0f6e065fd6","2aa7d3d15447778b99ba2e0d9525d3e4236316a7","aca8bb9d59ec092c1bb83b1a42686b0c6e4999c9","9af10016b9fe52868b1cc07b12477382fafa0981","ee474925dd882f850a1376444bd12607b33945c6","4c289cb92f11657076f6c5ea547ce3ed82e8ab66","e048e5c95548dcfb9ec0ffa3b7a340a4f595180a","7cf462964ac6558cb6b0a81054cc2f8803f188a0","68720ec71a5d4f1861ffb2d559ebc359a6493bfc","a6f93a78a6d995db55d89f01c6f5df6cbcf667c3","5b994478490185bb0b7d5f4dda8b3af7327c0bd0","5cb0a4ac38d4c89bb19df70e65a142947d070459","430ee190fe2ae74f829b860933a71635d0bd6955","a80ca16b6f2f918bbec7912b369e071fb60b5a03","ee6789ddf25ea68748fbc998fa9eb2f81b65302b"],"title":"Reconstructing transmission trees for communicable diseases using densely sampled genetic data.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS898"}

This is particularly true for longitudinal biomarkers where individual trajectory may improve the diagnosis. We propose a pattern mixture model (PMM) framework to predict a binary disease status from a longitudinal sequence of biomarkers. The marker distribution given the disease status is estimated from a linear mixed effects model. A likelihood ratio statistic is computed as the combination rule, which is optimal in the sense of the maximum receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve under the correctly specified mixed effects model. The individual disease risk score is then estimated by Bayes' theorem, and we derive the analytical form of the 95% confidence interval. We show that this PMM is an approximation to the shared random effects (SRE) model proposed by Albert (2012. A linear mixed model for predicting a binary event from longitudinal data under random effects mis-specification. Statistics in Medicine 31: (2), 143-154). Further, with extensive simulation studies, we found that the PMM is more robust than the SRE model under wide classes of models. This new PPM approach for combining biomarkers is motivated by and applied to a fetal growth study, where the interest is in predicting macrosomia using longitudinal ultrasound measurements.","inCitations":["2f710e16d9911e5dd633536d86c4ce5a8bc09ed5","7ff9de584164a37ef5e84bd1374b5cc170a48649","d40f544aa01a8975386d039bbfd43e65b1de5257","545e0c3eab40d34cdf4523e413ef50072b6714b9","81d5f0538fdc4d52612e5525b2927a1bfca45d12","33b477a0615c9a9bbb2e867223652a6057f4759d","33b942a01a499739265875bb71c5ac69128266a0","0ad62396efbc5320ef4468b00f392e4731968404"],"title":"Combination of longitudinal biomarkers in predicting binary events.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu020"}

The commonly used multinomial-logit model is limiting due to its restrictive mean-variance structure. For instance, analyzing count data from the recent RNA-seq technology by the multinomial-logit model leads to serious errors in hypothesis testing. The ubiquity of over-dispersion and complicated correlation structures among multivariate counts calls for more flexible regression models. In this article, we study some generalized linear models that incorporate various correlation structures among the counts. Current literature lacks a treatment of these models, partly due to the fact that they do not belong to the natural exponential family. We study the estimation, testing, and variable selection for these models in a unifying framework. The regression models are compared on both synthetic and real RNA-seq data.","inCitations":["cee436c4a33bfb43ccc475f9f0068cd8e74149ee","c5c5294ffe3bbf942c6cdee3fef9d913fcfe383b","5c945555bf820ecbb00e59405379c2fec8a2f417","653b6f7c814b3f29fe048796f40e5fdadc2fd4b2","9646af31f509f7dd0ad98b85f146c0a0272c03e4","eb237e547943257b222ea88560bad4af4bd6e68c","7564a084b076bf1a705c71e8d9622830a75f8b05","287de338babc81912de088e359e59950c34370ae","22f843465e25556a68f4a5abbed2f4c5538c5ebb","7a9d5b09cee53ca7cb5219e368b25d75bf9cf004","06a1712b315c770183f3e85827483973998ff0d1","90ce533b91a8104b6f0fdc06fc82efe284254ded","24cd9b4d6a90337616ad54663ef74adb14183496","55318a821872bad70becafb6086474a56723257e","ca7e78d8001d83e235907c3b3db19ce3627e644b"],"title":"Regression Models For Multivariate Count Data.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2016.1154063"}
