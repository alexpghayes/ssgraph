Each patient is infected with several species of pathogens, but the response to study medication for some of these pathogens may be unknown because some specimens were lost or because the patient received nonstudy medication that was known to be effective against these species. This paper develops a statistical model that estimates pi for each treatment and that accounts for the unknown pathogen responses as well as overdispersion of the remaining responses due to within-patient effects. The data are modeled with the Poisson distribution for the numbers of pathogen species per patient and the beta-binomial model for pathogen eradication. The Poisson and beta-binomial parameters are estimated through maximum likelihood estimation, and the treatment difference in the pi valves and its standard error are estimated by transforming the underlying parameters. Confidence intervals based on these estimates are constructed to test the hypothesis of noninferiority of the test treatment.","inCitations":["e02d59c72428a4183a32ff467a17998a511a1bb5"],"title":"Testing microbiologic response to antiinfective medications with incomplete data.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120008847"}

Computational statistics","paperAbstract":"Gaussian Process (GP) models provide a very flexible nonparametric approach to modeling location-and-time indexed datasets. However, the storage and computational requirements for GP models are infeasible for large spatial datasets. Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (Datta A, Banerjee S, Finley AO, Gelfand AE. Hierarchical nearest-neighbor gaussian process models for large geostatistical datasets. J Am Stat Assoc 2016., JASA) provide a scalable alternative by using local information from few nearest neighbors. Scalability is achieved by using the neighbor sets in a conditional specification of the model. We show how this is equivalent to sparse modeling of Cholesky factors of large covariance matrices. We also discuss a general approach to construct scalable Gaussian Processes using sparse local kriging. We present a multivariate data analysis which demonstrates how the nearest neighbor approach yields inference indistinguishable from the full rank GP despite being several times faster. Finally, we also propose a variant of the NNGP model for automating the selection of the neighbor set size.","inCitations":["af8ac27e34e2d85f2cb8439edb50547a42c76593","a3486f02b38b315f0f73addcf3461ec3daf2f5b6","53ad8980e9b45af084be4a8031be17228304d5fb","69e8329036d07e9cc9614a83859b1396556a6f56","a50bae14f289bbdfeae37ea0fd14ab24cba7f883","b6cd698803a08ce2612f506171b2e8b61876b052","59bc7be15a1cfcdc38864b45715189a72a5feb06","95c0ec4c631fc674cf14a34715f4de4837f3c7d0","21ed43a12129e97aa92d4802d731d11e7779ed48","fd0f6880cb0372eddccb0db556ae5dd343a2499d","521e5c337be51b8f8fdb858580bb46a0545ab1f9"],"title":"On nearest-neighbor Gaussian process models for massive spatial data.","doi":"10.1002/wics.1383"}

In this article, we take a systematic approach, consisting of a start-up design, a follow-on design, a sequential dose-finding design, and an estimation method, to find an efficient estimate of the maximum tolerated dose under the assumption that the dose-response curve has a true underlying logistic distribution. In particular, for the problem of the nonexistence of the maximum likelihood estimates of the logistic parameters, a constraint on the probability of an undetermined maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is incorporated into the parametric sequential designs. In addition, this approach can also be extended to incorporate ethical considerations, which prohibit an administered dose from exceeding the maximum acceptable dose. Comparison based on simulation studies between the systematic designs and nonparametric designs are described both for continuous dose spaces and discrete dose spaces, respectively.","inCitations":["55e4fa635b9c79549fe14e14f5d940f869741e84","5e8b092727d01909b17e0557e54e45ee95b64067","9a4d5afa0422b166714cc25b39d6bf6ee8c69122"],"title":"Sequential designs for logistic phase I clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600860337"}

However, its use in the regulatory setting for industry trials remains controversial, primarily due to the difficulty in interpreting conventional asymptotic statistical tests under restricted methods of treatment allocation. We argue that the use of minimization should be critically evaluated when designing the study for which it is proposed. We demonstrate by example how simulation can be used to investigate whether minimization improves treatment balance compared with stratified randomization, and how much randomness can be incorporated into the minimization before any balance advantage is no longer retained. We also illustrate by example how the performance of the traditional model-based analysis can be assessed, by comparing the nominal test size with the observed test size over a large number of simulations. We recommend that the assignment probability for the minimization be selected using such simulations.","inCitations":["be7691086d1791fea8c3d64cb983f671200ec110","5a2ddcfbb8928283079b7a86586fd25080a28586","07e900f514ff8d2b47482c8fff39a8e4e5ed63f2","6ec39137c7a7f5d830df88a9990d4e8f04d7caf2","d6e8858fbde904d068bb9a532f6be24462d3d8fd","e46be0309ef2a1c0dc5eaa4b2fdc03b349b709f9","d6a0acd0abac522889bac51a02bb4ebd2c285521","061714c96cbc00afd94db5803f7495e6a503d68b","a83136b75891c503983acf0d4b1caa3b3df478a6"],"title":"Use of simulation to compare the performance of minimization with stratified blocked randomization.","doi":"10.1002/pst.346"}

There is no guarantee, however, that they will still perform adequately when there are few respondents in the focal group or in both the reference and the focal group. Angoff's delta plot is a potentially useful alternative for small-sample DIF investigation, but it suffers from an improper DIF flagging criterion. The purpose of this paper is to improve this classification rule under mild statistical assumptions. This improvement yields a modified delta plot with an adjusted DIF flagging criterion for small samples. A simulation study was conducted to compare the modified delta plot with both the classical delta plot approach and the Mantel-Haenszel method. It is concluded that the modified delta plot is consistently less conservative and more powerful than the usual delta plot, and is also less conservative and more powerful than the Mantel-Haenszel method as long as at least one group of respondents is small.","inCitations":["a3a5caca6d5431cbccf52e689b86d7dc0828e883","25265882497332817ad18c73fe0272d4ba0a3e40","7e9f286b3aba399975fabd05f28f9cae8373fc67","0dcf605bd1f141bfb5efb7936bc4bffa1d6b66af","b6d708a8335234d7b62ed37506139e6e8660f173","a5f918e225323722e204e278da1c0968a4ac0c3d"],"title":"Angoff's delta method revisited: improving DIF detection under small samples.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02025.x"}

The unique nature of this framework is that the directions of the regression coefficients are inferred first, and the lengths and the tuning parameters are determined by a cross validation procedure to achieve the largest prediction accuracy. We provide a theoretical result for simultaneous model selection consistency and parameter estimation consistency of our method in high dimension. This new framework is then generalized such that it can be applied to principal components analysis, partial least squares and canonical correlation analysis. We also adapt this framework for discriminant analysis. Compared to the existing methods, where there is relatively little control of the dependency among the sparse components, our method can control the relationships among the components. We present efficient algorithms and related theory for solving the sparse regression by projection problem. Based on extensive simulations and real data analysis, we demonstrate that our method achieves good predictive performance and variable selection in the regression setting, and the ability to control relationships between the sparse components leads to more accurate classification. In supplemental materials available online, the details of the algorithms and theoretical proofs, and R codes for all simulation studies are provided.","inCitations":["b8dbc167305d0c2a465e90bb289181fe41a2629c","eff5d5ebc3a9bdd3789219a54a6acc30d9a0780a","5cc85aa67177c2c8274b982a5ad97be320471f55","e9e34b380f313e49420c30c081a45de47582dfa1","304ddf95e2a39e2a3f2a196d35623d4adb168254","728b21284d6472d31268305f521218d6bd2098b2","88b253749f84701428990b73384baa388883fe62"],"title":"Sparse Regression by Projection and Sparse Discriminant Analysis.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2014.907094"}

Traditional approaches are not appropriate for this purpose. Instead, a novel approach which is based on the null statistic is used in the literature. The null statistic approach, using the permutation samples of all features, permits the more accurate estimation of the [Formula: see text]-value for a target feature. However, the known methods, working based on the null statistic, cannot be applied to features with three or more levels. In the present study, an attempt is made to introduce a new permutation test statistic which can be modified to the null statistic approach when features have three or more levels. The robustness of the proposed test statistic and its performance in estimating the [Formula: see text]-value are demonstrated through conducting simulation studies and the analysis of two real datasets.","inCitations":["3f409f8a87cb932efa72ab2d6da130c13929b21b"],"title":"A modified F-test for hypothesis testing in large-scale data.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2018.1436557"}

By the time the molecules reach peripheral blood, they have been so diluted so as to not be assayable. It is not possible to invasively (surgically) measure these agents in the brain. This creates a difficult situation in terms of assessing whether or not the dynamics may have changed due to disease or aging. Moreover, most biological feedforward and feedback interactions occur after time delays, and the time delays need to be properly estimated. We address the following two questions: (1) Is it possible to devise a combination of clinical experiments by which, via exogenous inputs, the hormonal system can be perturbed to new steady-states in such a way that information about the unobserved components can be ascertained; and, (2) Can one devise methods to estimate (possibly, time-varying) time delays between components of a multidimensional nonlinear time series, which are more robust than traditional methods? We present methods for both questions, using the Stress (ACTH-cortisol) hormonal system as a prototype, but the approach is more broadly applicable.","inCitations":["61bb5fa2b1705211c74a5194d9f1bf5251499b55","d35ce487f9bb8b1ba4656824ee329e8219a5a14b","82a4b0ea6a780593d10eaa8c86239edc7f923843"],"title":"Modeling the Nonlinear Time Dynamics of Multidimensional Hormonal Systems.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9892.2012.00795.x"}

Current methods for fitting cognitive diagnosis models to educational test data and assigning examinees to proficiency classes are based on parametric estimation methods such as expectation maximization (EM) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that frequently encounter difficulties in practical applications. In response to these difficulties, non-parametric classification techniques (cluster analysis) have been proposed as heuristic alternatives to parametric procedures. These non-parametric classification techniques first aggregate each examinee's test item scores into a profile of attribute sum scores, which then serve as the basis for clustering examinees into proficiency classes. Like the parametric procedures, the non-parametric classification techniques require that the Q-matrix underlying a given test be known. Unfortunately, in practice, the Q-matrix for most tests is not known and must be estimated to specify the associations between items and attributes, risking a misspecified Q-matrix that may then result in the incorrect classification of examinees. This paper demonstrates that clustering examinees into proficiency classes based on their item scores rather than on their attribute sum-score profiles does not require knowledge of the Q-matrix, and results in a more accurate classification of examinees.","inCitations":["5c21884349d7ad87d31337d081f3330df8beb47e","fbcdf83353e449b9a6eb994c5587159948578b67","5721d6a334d02fd02574e74b1a5ec6d2c17fefa5"],"title":"Heuristic cognitive diagnosis when the Q-matrix is unknown.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12044"}

Composite measures almost always have error. Correspondingly, it is important to understand the reliability of the scores from any particular composite measure. However, the point estimates of the reliability of composite measures are fallible and thus all such point estimates should be accompanied by a confidence interval. When confidence intervals are wide, there is much uncertainty in the population value of the reliability coefficient. Given the importance of reporting confidence intervals for estimates of reliability, coupled with the undesirability of wide confidence intervals, we develop methods that allow researchers to plan sample size in order to obtain narrow confidence intervals for population reliability coefficients. We first discuss composite reliability coefficients and then provide a discussion on confidence interval formation for the corresponding population value. Using the accuracy in parameter estimation approach, we develop two methods to obtain accurate estimates of reliability by planning sample size. The first method provides a way to plan sample size so that the expected confidence interval width for the population reliability coefficient is sufficiently narrow. The second method ensures that the confidence interval width will be sufficiently narrow with some desired degree of assurance (e.g., 99% assurance that the 95% confidence interval for the population reliability coefficient will be less than W units wide). The effectiveness of our methods was verified with Monte Carlo simulation studies. We demonstrate how to easily implement the methods with easy-to-use and freely available software.","inCitations":["d31bd09e0197bbbe865f8de72ed0225e6b76914c","c9c436845d0738b7cc39d21124fa8d9e3e037e06","2cbc5d3d4f12f77b12f150f1773b624c9281027a","1657f35191c42d198ab5898a8808547a1519d2ce","a3c3f4a26768a88d727e92b943e7b4c118897179","2cbb26be38c489febad629dc9d1d07e2473ceba6","8d8e4c3fa489851e46d8ba8212f11fe47e036876","04208fe13ef45d38140e6133718b0f5d7c6999a5"],"title":"Sample size planning for composite reliability coefficients: accuracy in parameter estimation via narrow confidence intervals.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02030.x"}

As these permutations are made within modality, the permutation test is valid even if both modalities are measured on different scales. We show that our permutation test is a sign test for the symmetry of an underlying discrete distribution whose size remains valid under the assumption of equal AUCs. We demonstrate the operating characteristics of our test via simulation and show that our test is equal in power to a permutation test recently proposed by Bandos and others (2005).","inCitations":["3fa3b1903885c88406bd2887e635a41617b4795c","a60785bed8b0a1ec58b379e71f9adfd4596cc305","3551a223ac42bfb5e37e69c45b30f2b1a0f01f09","239b44fd21c3f949f9fdf43bfedd4ab2a3d314e3","1b3ddea65e35cecca7b2a481e65e27ff21b72612","04bc9824ddba5cbe37b5ac8e08dca990665aa3a0","f72b2a384e3a5b9c57dbbd8907c30d293ee316e3","0f531566ccd8e5a507b2f78fc305196d8df2d1f9","6b7eb453201e6029ce7f0cbbf197c399e1364f2a","ba305d28ab5570a7022982b3e80b7985d8279753","c0ef59ffcfb43afe37977b4b8ffea2eb6329269b","6b8b1303efccb3c3a35ac6e3a50316f661c95cd6","e082d7a4e45222d4ebb84e3acbed27b3340a0ed4","3d080f89f86fcf09902dca4a10d65f02c193679f","09ba3865b6144d79935e4e57095e15fd5bedc7cc","15220065e96d5d22b68c8fce2e8570924d595ef1"],"title":"A modified sign test for comparing paired ROC curves.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm036"}

Any such sequence of nested partitions can in turn be characterized by an ultrametric. An approach to generalizing an (ultrametric) representation is proposed in which the nested character of the partition sequence is relaxed and replaced by the weaker requirement that the classes within each partition contain objects consecutive with respect to a fixed ordering of the objects. A method for fitting such a structure to a given proximity matrix is discussed, along with several alternative strategies for graphical representation. Using this same ultrametric extension, additive tree representations can also be generalized by replacing the ultrametric component in the decomposition of an additive tree (into an ultrametric and a centroid metric). A common numerical illustration is developed and maintained throughout the paper.","inCitations":["133998fd4ab64f2c33e1ed0df3bee06bbaca689a","52934c2565e544ebf5e260477cdafe31a3272cb8"],"title":"Modelling dissimilarity: generalizing ultrametric and additive tree representations.","doi":"10.1348/000711001159456"}

The objective of this simulation study is to examine the effect of omitting confounding variables from the propensity score on the quintile-stratified propensity adjustment in a longitudinal study. The primary focus was the impact of a misspecified propensity score on bias. Three features of the omitted confounding variables were examined: type of predictor variable (binary vs. continuous), constancy over time (time-varying vs. time-invariant), and magnitude of the association with treatment and outcome (null, small, and large odds ratios). The simulation results indicate that omission of continuous, time-varying confounders that are strongly associated with treatment and outcome (i.e., an odds ratio of 1.75) adversely impacts bias, coverage, and type I error. Omitted time-varying continuous variables had somewhat more effect on bias than omitted binary variables. Time-invariant confounding variables that are not included in the propensity score have a much less effect on results. This evaluation only examined continuous treatment effectiveness outcomes and the propensity scores used for stratification included just four variables. Relative to the use of the propensity adjustment in applied settings that typically comprise numerous potential confounding variables, the impact of one omitted continuous, time-varying confound in this simulation study could be overstated.","inCitations":["68bb4923de946e91fec02c82db205fa1fab7dca2","7419376551c20fc88f524cb08e32aff7d348b90f","7fc5a6cfd9fc7ceb7c5472a26148ae8065c0c05d","7375793648257698169b42b4466d57840698d394","6e1aa22a4d9cba15f09d120979da15bff67ed780","a86672902cc514245313a2ba7984141eed21a49d","59da5b55e3d68408805afe290e2e8827ec017a4a","194932c38ba9efceebe857f38216d60313b19391","1481f370cf92adbcad951b1abdb521e6c49c2590","47e84b6ad50843864e749318491ad34fe5c4b472","f82892cd19daa608beaa796c9fd91ef589f40d4c"],"title":"Quintile stratification based on a misspecified propensity score in longitudinal treatment effectiveness analyses of ordinal doses","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2006.12.021"}
