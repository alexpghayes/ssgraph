A two-stage seamless trial design is referred to as a study design that combines two separate clinical studies that are normally conducted to achieve separate objectives, such as a phase II study for treatment selection and a phase III study for efficacy confirmation. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to consider study endpoints with different treatment durations at different stages (see, e.g., Chow and Chang, 2006; Maca et al., 2006). Chow et al. (2007) and Lu et al. (2009) considered the cases where the study endpoints are continuous variables and binary responses, respectively. In this article, our attention is placed on the case where the study endpoints are time-to-event data with different treatment durations. For testing equality, superiority, and noninferiority/equivalence of two treatments, test statistics for the analysis of the combined data collected from the two stages are developed for Weibull distributed data. In addition, formulas for sample size calculation and sample size allocation between the two stages for each of the hypotheses are derived. Corresponding results are also derived under Cox's proportional hazards model.","inCitations":["8003e4e06aaef309e2721f9c91977eea71823ad3","b49913cfdf710617c46da4f1763d1433fb73f2c1","6808968fbfafa128285c0b03ce814c97343df722","fe702c36320a86139292c2ae7f87e1810e744913","3cd0887766a1a22870851cd32f3e35f75ee6b85c"],"title":"Analysis of time-to-event data under a two-stage survival adaptive design in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003618066"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2002,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Multi-level repeated ordinal data arise if ordinal outcomes are measured repeatedly in subclusters of a cluster or on subunits of an experimental unit. If both the regression coefficients and the correlation parameters are of interest, the Bayesian hierarchical models have proved to be a powerful tool for analysis with computation being performed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The hierarchical models extend the random effects models by including a (usually flat) prior on the regression coefficients and parameters in the distribution of the random effects. Because the MCMC can be implemented by the widely available BUGS or WinBUGS software packages, the computation burden of MCMC has been alleviated. However, thoughtfulness is essential in order to use this software effectively to analyze such data with complex structures. For example, we may have to reparameterize the model and standardize the covariates to accelerate the convergence of the MCMC, and then carefully monitor the convergence of the Markov chain. This article aims at resolving these issues in the application of the WinBUGS through the analysis of a real multi-level ordinal data. In addition, we extend the hierarchical model to include a wider class of distributions for the random effects. We propose to use the deviance information criterion (DIC) for model selection. We show that the WinBUGS software can readily implement such extensions and the DIC criterion.","inCitations":["887fc4fd4a7ca8e39b07395a76694ccc6f14353c","b9613453d1afd370d76b62dfd2235d9506c2b7bb","f4a995aeeeea68a4693675322700c6d574ef384b","0cc368c9fa945bcc21f2611bfdde12082e3f31f1","562a62d86186a9ea5d408992514dd8047f8140d0","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","6e68b379370c07e1b3f9af04eeafef3082098c47","c7e7c9d773474d5f40e20b62ccd1edc310cfd47c","b727970b13a788e0e8c8ed5270c51ffeb2bb65a9","ba3f03890c6649ea3a65026bd56085f84c0529fb","53aba5c7e1f97994bf59eec8230680d24993d943","2fcb6f5636903a6e36a4766ed7801af0385838ff","8dccdc7f978c80cfd95beff8cdb96c9cf652c972","8253b62f6d85bc438deee3020d4f03be0715b64b"],"title":"Bayesian hierarchical models for multi-level repeated ordinal data using WinBUGS.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120014415"}

Fortunately, modern genotyping platforms also detect CNVs with fairly high reliability. Hidden Markov models and algorithms have played a dominant role in the interpretation of CNV data. Here we explore CNV reconstruction via estimation with a fused-lasso penalty as suggested by Tibshirani and Wang [Biostatistics 9 (2008) 18-29]. We mount a fresh attack on this difficult optimization problem by the following: (a) changing the penalty terms slightly by substituting a smooth approximation to the absolute value function, (b) designing and implementing a new MM (majorization-minimization) algorithm, and (c) applying a fast version of Newton's method to jointly update all model parameters. Together these changes enable us to minimize the fused-lasso criterion in a highly effective way.We also reframe the reconstruction problem in terms of imputation via discrete optimization. This approach is easier and more accurate than parameter estimation because it relies on the fact that only a handful of possible copy number states exist at each SNP. The dynamic programming framework has the added bonus of exploiting information that the current fused-lasso approach ignores. The accuracy of our imputations is comparable to that of hidden Markov models at a substantially lower computational cost.","inCitations":["983d65c0e555cd183343ed5ad4b4d288cd926e7d","714cd49af41c9aa70ee3bf08cac6ac33efe5093e","16de2d2f930b5eb3f39b78d36a7d97cd9e59fa33","752b0b771763c61a7595cbe17f7e53015ad6b85f","f223954c4868bc8b30fd6c7b4fedb7a82b98f67b","ee592db49fd43d8d4d89e2b9e77ed28228cfcf51","77b6ae49b83b5aed518bf60045e474e5022d7b97","0bf2fbfcd7bbc611eb8db4358bad7a870bf830b5","cc7fb1c385f046af6cc9c77d1ea1f9fe0c31c92c","5d2fa7ebdb61d83ae7954bb48b7f7d44dd16b7ad","9c3cfb99c549a434efe2e2f116f2f37d40515a36","1ad828cf91e4c56162e9e3bef30a28fd3180d8b0","f692e97047b420268d721ae5d53649eafbc56cd9","5a16e485c92a3fffdf33976e999d95a2c18bd55f","d5faa96cf9df3acea54b1ffe478135e3f45119b4","5823c445a14435431322d8439220983fe43fdaf1","63d9a67ef8324a9134e4065ceffd2804672b33e5","f6dc99771f5eafbb62f108a8a2b6dc91d3745661","48288318cee36df77cb73e4807b610235525ba4e","213989dbbefbfbefd9fb662f692936c9010234e2","92352974c8f4596def7a3e57b9c7dae01e303163","6a0039d3fb9801edc458abbaf4b621fbc9607381"],"title":"Reconstructing Dna Copy Number by Penalized Estimation and Imputation.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS357"}

A major challenge that arises is that the number of compounds to search over can be quite large, sometimes numbering in the millions, making experimental testing intractable. For this reason computational methods are employed to filter out those compounds which do not exhibit strong biological activity. This filtering step, also called virtual screening reduces the search space, allowing for the remaining compounds to be experimentally tested.In this paper we propose several novel approaches to the problem of virtual screening based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and on a kernel-based extension. Spectral learning ideas motivate our proposed new method called Indefinite Kernel CCA (IKCCA). We show the strong performance of this approach both for a toy problem as well as using real world data with dramatic improvements in predictive accuracy of virtual screening over an existing methodology.","inCitations":["9c99905dee745bc5d8e8bb649da4737437a8f465","1f10ed0ec8edbbc3a9be1827120faea36927320b","27717bfebc453625e53f3edc943b7cbc4a02ee55","bf14c7cb501cb7b71fb84d39b01c9008f844dd00","a38dd481461cae789c937f11c7f5af8af228d82c","0a2e7c7821c04f72d7c60428886981016732c231","dc96f81fad85d3ccde836d8c0df09c09e59257b0"],"title":"Local Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis with Application to Virtual Drug Screening.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS472"}

However, their use is limited to applications where a single vector of features is measured for each subject. In practice, data are often multi‐way, or measured over multiple dimensions. For example, metabolite abundance may be measured over multiple regions or tissues, or gene expression may be measured over multiple time points, for the same subjects. We propose a framework for linear classification of high‐dimensional multi‐way data, in which coefficients can be factorized into weights that are specific to each dimension. More generally, the coefficients for each measurement in a multi‐way dataset are assumed to have low‐rank structure. This framework extends existing classification techniques from single vector to multi‐way features, and we have implemented multi‐way versions of SVM and DWD. We describe informative simulation results, and apply multi‐way DWD to data for two very different clinical research studies. The first study uses magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite data over multiple brain regions to compare participants with and without spinocerebellar ataxia; the second uses publicly available gene expression time‐course data to compare degrees of treatment response among patients with multiple sclerosis. Our multi‐way method can improve performance and simplify interpretation over naive applications of full rank linear and non‐linear classification to multi‐way data.

We extend this work by investigating the effect of the number of indicators per measurement occasion on power. We analytically demonstrate that the positive effect of multiple indicators on statistical power is inversely related to the relative magnitude of occasion-specific latent residual variance and is independent of the specific model that constitutes the observed variables, in particular of other parameters in the LGCM. When designing a study, researchers have to consider trade-offs of costs and benefits of different design features. We demonstrate how knowledge about power equivalent transformations between indicator measurement designs allows researchers to identify the most cost-efficient research design for detecting parameters of interest. Finally, we integrate different formal results to exhibit the trade-off between the number of measurement occasions and number of indicators per occasion for constant power in LGCMs.","inCitations":["3b72e72c2aea119e0407e89dd5d4a832bdd628f5","862675eb31c39ec3420c2e1d4b174715df5b89b6","b6bc51212951d95024fe21c0d38d0f868c4336a1","876eabc6d4d746596d20cebf09409cf955286c8c","dfaa40f0cf3d9de422197985e41bdceee08bdda8","76dc9029e7f2c5ba0348bc0126ac49a66501de75","108ad31987f0e02b20983127fe10a1d155223a81","87ddee6b3b19e00756b38b68d090bb7e8a9a3da6","886ce4a4148c224792751c246a1f79a29795c5e1","c735cdcffbfc1377a49cbc203d02854633d1065d","e75994014375b2234a2ea86e898cf7a0fdf4ae9c","cd7045839ea072c101312e9e0ca7d38400a835e1","ac8487bd5de9101ecf46fb1ce85adc3a4de3abae","e44dff3aa77188215fdb8c3648f22872335f5369","796507d5fda40b6d84520d80c6a76d14cd6792b3","91ef483140f77efd86b970e4817d82d66094ce50","970e1485347e782012034b804d0b1d394e9b781f","b725c47efe02022f4c53cf90f75dfa34ad17ead3","63fecb7f1e9833d1e14e55dc6c1c949fbac4c63b","e080e21d25267061dadd469c6469d03fd1ad48e5","a4e4debad7c2db1922f1c5800320fdaef6260001","f75810f361794edfad59eff85835bf1c2c50c4a1","158a7b7fa62ab3bbd3e63022f4b7ec84587e0c76","51aaf125749847f20fde4eac6bb5cbf354b37b3f","e0316a374819bb1cfec9e72d63ff843eaa20334d","d0677ee6af8a334f3d764f36bf1d3df6965ea6c4","b22f6ecd338ee39e0789488d0ac52f07b9fa0bd0","cf0438067e647e7e8a7cebbe6c5ac47c45ea3f7f"],"title":"The effect of multiple indicators on the power to detect inter-individual differences in change.","doi":"10.1348/000711010X486633"}

A distribution-free alternative to the parametric likelihood is use of empirical likelihood (EL) techniques, well known in the context of nonparametric testing of statistical hypotheses. Empirical likelihoods have been shown to exhibit many of the properties of conventional parametric likelihoods. In this article, we propose and examine Bayes factors (BF) methods that are derived via the EL ratio approach. Following Kass & Wasserman [10], we consider Bayes factors type decision rules in the context of standard statistical testing techniques. We show that the asymptotic properties of the proposed procedure are similar to the classical BF's asymptotic operating characteristics. Although we focus on hypothesis testing, the proposed approach also yields confidence interval estimators of unknown parameters. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate the theoretical results as well as to demonstrate the power of the proposed test.","inCitations":["ae1ea5a9871637d15876f0789d245c6d3ffd87db","7a3ea387e50f8fcf748bfbb7a450797dee9266c0","0397d646dc8a11efab48ff9dcbbc02ab630d6b39"],"title":"Nonparametric Bayes Factors Based On Empirical Likelihood Ratios.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2012.08.011"}

The nonparametric transfer function is estimated jointly with the ARMA parameters. By modeling the correlation in the noise, the transfer function can be estimated more efficiently. The parsimonious ARMA structure improves the estimation efficiency in finite samples. The asymptotic properties of the estimators are investigated. The finite-sample properties are illustrated through simulations and one empirical example.","inCitations":["2c34ae01aeb9bd8efde1a7b018fc8910cd84109a","a6937f55a3cb72926a372f351cbd2ac0a0cf8231","1f7f84a79859203b7b6537ff1b9176d3adf5028e","f29d6a8cd5b7f8a236483e83b214c67d4070ef8a","767ae7a8076b4f3974a39f33a761d76f6086cb87","009d575c647cffbb790f5efa48836c963da0b9b7","84a64fc1c4225dd6ad66565dbda394f87e4f7e02","7653b8cab5a12308a8ce86673d9b4c32ab55fb3f","ee52cd476d3db43c54f7d2982bb50bc404107bbc","de4bbec09fa5ccc5f490fc151d4ebe2b808f646b","42f1c7d8ba3ecf26a46a40c9a0832e1fbafab0fe","7767a681100d7ef987216347b69f646fe06f3fa1","dcf0f03a36e87fbcf6340d86394c2803a8a44d62","a48caea7b129f0361ea121f19d220c8a8b210121"],"title":"Nonparametric Transfer Function Models.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2009.10.029"}

Issues related to reliable and accurate measurement have evolved over many decades, dating back to the nineteenth century and the pioneering work of Galton (1886), Pearson (1896, 1899, 1901), and Fisher (1925). Requiring a new measurement to be identical to the truth is often impractical, either because (1) we are willing to accept a measurement up to some tolerable (or acceptable) error, or (2) the truth is simply not available to us, either because it is not measurable or is only measurable with some degree of error. To deal with issues related to both (1) and (2), a number of concepts, methods, and theories have been developed in various disciplines. Some of these concepts have been used across disciplines, while others have been limited to a particular field but may have potential uses in other disciplines. In this paper, we elucidate and contrast fundamental concepts employed in different disciplines and unite these concepts into one common theme: assessing closeness (agreement) of observations. We focus on assessing agreement with continuous measurements and classify different statistical approaches as (1) descriptive tools; (2) unscaled summary indices based on absolute differences of measurements; and (3) scaled summary indices attaining values between -1 and 1 for various data structures, and for cases with and without a reference. We also identify gaps that require further research and discuss future directions in assessing agreement.","inCitations":["f1b7387c111b47332e2968dc1034c5c923933667","0208700022a787e936d2c3237b494ce6b00c4ef8","f616c729f0851979e8348885e737c2f8f305eb74","443b99e329f53b3f830cec6f2a2109d2e8477079","10b1738a41f199ddf24c926b3d042ac08ab55ca7","2a4ddadbe4244ae9305bf75d9a664815cf133cdd","2098a241f471fe47e6af6e8bd5ecf5a7fe0dfb42","6894f015879360b0adef78012840a473abd6f8e2","15218e510a6917ddbec44622bda3b71f0c9a2942","dc32f32da2b18c8e53dfad3251f9ec5dceab4424","db6e9fac8ccb1538dfbaafd96e0b75ad414567c7","d54ea9f84b4f66170dcb1f9e4076c16e470eaf00","c890c337d1e06f32b7e969b600a410fd3c24c495","f6aa2b0e9155c59c39562a942cfee8c7218d0961","adc8070273326ca56315dfbbf3f93b04f5409dea","38f48180e8dcff7f4362be0334b14d3d2e27ebf1","9fa3d57b013da870d6ef7c50808e7badadfb82fe","22f1e515b1fbd7d4b75c8990b59b4b84c766c20e","2428b3f5ee70b0efe246296159a65ef5f375a82f","8bdfe8178eaeeb54f148a5a3bd708e4db0c6848c","2643f69c576d6d8db6cfc82e33713878a0eb8d30","0b4006496835d05ffc1c3fba504baa871280a2c0","653ee0e5d28cd3059203ed5ed5aa9ebfd1aefb2a","85fd02c2846558a2a0f2606ab6305c65a5326485","421c063c7c4c0394e8d2937e72867e97f3637867","378e3e71bc3f2c6cc5af891c91d2f8d65086f363","14c68427b76b248a5fb08ceb31ff9d39732516b1","982d3f42b07a5e345007728a4a44586a4450fd8d","a0dd2c37f9e5a6ca85378a70fabad1ba9fd8653c","9f21f898e4148403aa2cf739e07d51c79fabf6c7","147059cfc041748643a4105fdabf51ba9ba4a97e","d975a08cffe6370f4ca7e73a2907299a8fcec327","7776dfda13baaf8814f5f41ac174360a8ef727ac","11a140757dcdeee47a0a1603f74ef708adfcb3da","dd6c635fe7b0933eb0be0caad854fc4f19072e9b","cbdf509b7d474f126351f980bd994c5430fe74e8","3c754e12449dc6150ed41a0db15325015be5664d","3a9e60459d4c4f6942d6ddc274e6ff8075392bc4","f1fa1c3ed189a7193af1c93fabb48d2a3057e7aa","0ea38584df33287c08ed69485312c48eb9fb889b","4b6872940dc1a50f741f84e183d64abd3cfd67a0","8329f8db056c004c8abe9c5bd0f6e98977f1f3a7","641e7146990d593ace88e90c306385d91dade04d","529a454ec0e16de0d46d6c2304ca436fd04bd962","7da7492ac77a4c731ea3d2fa7c6bc52312609793","c633b4332b5f59bc51d9bb2e2a883cdb0f8a2058","00a4684e15aca717992c5f665afa52b07533cd63","112fc3f9dee58254d2bc6943a246a256e4004feb","476cb23acedf0d0e690d461666e812e317eedf8d","b0bfe0cfb9b82b4c1b257212eb4c99aa300797c3","929a2e2960dfe89e4293502709f420cd77bfb6c9","547976ae526e4deefa9623325e1297a5b37c5e6b","33451f4e1b3bc5a9f36d839c39de2d786b95ed9b","820d34761a1d76c751dc3d62ca0494b0d7f8219c","48218dd2e6db2aa7c94bcc413bf81cd8c96c4894","c1994e38d5e8fa861afeffb6f8d83dda15dfdd5b","b5482bba516ee086d77291a465a16630182725e7","5cf5512567788e4901c68d8a48ca4c4034c9f6e1","279c6ee3241eb1e68de963fc3abc6a29acf5d8a0","6e5c130842746de9287e551d2fb03d0d8bd69a50","1a83f9d4f230da8d1e5bdc7015c5026533ec83b9","a9a15119b21ef87199f40c7e1dcade81957b5d1e","d531c66ab0debc0fd52b9f8286359504d7e9fcdc","53314e2edf158ac66ae76fe3b92e5ce6a039ea3b","a255cbb30a3230f63372c7fa9ae6404d64718f13","2516c29e2e3df05122d9b45b83e116614ce1a617","5bde9e657e52f10cba85bc8f749e91d9c278fd7a","ddfc9e436a219112a832f7ed9183ce4cf72dfc9c","cdcfef4f771e4e8218b0ccf72fe0dfe421bcfd4f","c4fa6e76f4e6923350af2e87d1a23e02d8d706a0","3e807b4e02a610c1ed0930fbc101131a05e7a14d","546e868fa01c64423d5fb4069914a69276d4e1d0","af63f85877e3a734f1e51c71e92b3670a6c398f1","deec65e3c4a4e1f4a7962165a1b3e69688d7fc0d","d40232278139f9083d929ccd5a5b7ee80a45fca7","d4d68943159f79f520dc00054301ea257a0b9b4b","71668b1ec5b91143362e5157f21156037d6cbd1e","347ae1711f44ca82d365bab6790ea99edc6befe2","a86c6518af9c31e425093415a72294d9dfc10cbf","c32a74c5f22702930aa6861aab22a76ac9796c49","ca87926f8adf8466721cb4ba247177ed49311e51","22c1e5575d3bfb1082174566aab3c3b1fcbd4966","5b578ad0548028aaddd6b18d426e1859ac936830","3b7718244fc6b42fd72f90b61790fb48ef399c9c","8fb887fd804ed31975aea86a9f40342efe0962a8","82dea632ba7b16d93b3a57d09a5eed4625ca1043","692a5fec6d6a42fdab2f7bb8b70bba938791b016","2a4d9f82920ee1f8f0f08094ff014df13c28bb5c","5af3df3e0f55ebef3c0a8a8d04e73179c78ad44c","467d4bdaf4c501ccd6febf6504d98523b33235dc","77233b6c7608bb35ac27af0105e9d52c4a060975","aaa2714b9a2cd3cd9f58d1c1ac5fee644ebebb15","3d867e7647f97723e9733a4785460042db24b122","79096865d35f08d6c668f8b2cbfa0378af1b4bcd","14663d45d562bdc9f998e65f3cf14e867da9e3a2","5c186563f085fff5101be5e9f48bd9699f66baac","85bb624a5bf47ad1d4a94d28c381889f3f27834b","ec3f54928a3b3617a0fc1775849a35ea313d3e61","000524cddaab0b0c974bd65d05285d4aade1c6f3","be26038ba4b72a9c636c1b1dfa6af97f2358dc49","f95f4739975c51d28ee835e7894a9106ac387cda","44fcc6ab58706f50932487a2fd3133e7f863c150","6a79a0066f0b1a1a7e76a2064e38fe341659e8d2","0e77de315262d2d17a28f84b1f8f5730f9428d58","5733fd9c34622f434465fb50c1294a71e106cbb0","0037227d34bf22eabf9680f3858fdef8af9b599b","a42dc0fee9b925e44b12a5ee9839fbd1270a97cb","f0e96ee896e2ff854b439f1395686206ffb6c128","b09bc326d11576b86fb3d0b60de070ce1b4b0191","add42a35feda192b5dbaf2e3a180961c320c5a85","2210b8d14a7dc8f7023337b0e2a56886e2ba8f18","f29487b0a515b96652d46f7064e75d9129d84966","cc16fd8498f95a75cd5972c0f4f0514aae8f37db","b40a0a8238e035934efd583c1566fc6d86878cf1","bbb3d0e5d053160b07a4d064b12975063626028d","9bc4d7574d7be3124039603635b

Several doses are tested with each compound and it is assumed that, if there is a dose-response relationship, the relationship follows a monotonic curve, usually a version of the median-effect equation. However, the null hypothesis of no relationship cannot be statistically tested using this equation. We used a linearized version of this equation to define a measure of pharmacological effect size, and use this measure to rank the investigated compounds in order of their overall capability to produce strong responses. The null hypothesis that none of the examined doses of a particular compound produced a strong response can be tested with this approach. The proposed approach is based on a new statistical model of the important concept of response detection limit, a concept that is usually neglected in the analysis of dose-response data with continuous responses. The methodology is illustrated with data from a study searching for compounds that neutralize the infection by a human immunodeficiency virus of brain glioblastoma cells.","inCitations":["8d2c3c6e9d94bc32ecc81ec4e6eb78c0ab5926c2"],"title":"Measuring and Statistically Testing the Size of the Effect of a Chemical Compound on a Continuous In-Vitro Pharmacological Response Through a New Statistical Model of Response Detection Limit.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.920871"}

Consequently, the estimation and comparison of treatment effects based on the empirical distribution of the responses can be biased since the units exposed to the various treatments could differ in important unknown pretreatment characteristics, which are related to the response. An important example studied in this article is the question of whether private schools offer better quality of education than public schools. In order to address this question we use data collected in the year 2000 by OECD for the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Focusing for illustration on scores in mathematics of 15-years old pupils in Ireland, we find that the raw average score of pupils in private schools is higher than of pupils in public schools. However, application of a newly proposed method for observational studies suggests that the less able pupils tend to enroll in public schools, such that their lower scores is not necessarily an indication of bad quality of the public schools. Indeed, when comparing the average score in the two types of schools after adjusting for the enrollment effects, we find quite surprisingly that public schools perform better on average. This outcome is supported by the methods of instrumental variables and latent variables, commonly used by econometricians for analyzing and evaluating social programs.","inCitations":["d7bdd1a8af247464d3956f108421edf2fcaa4199","19396be52da99595956e076353f11cd4c27bde89","0e4130b069d2733106a510ae220382dd7a8291ce","73acb742293ad6ff6db690896b91c4a00240fad7","39d35e0bdf6f16584287f1862bd7711613a55d2a","70702effca28e83c421ceb3f1cc6a5dd8237d76d","dd18d7ee12c32d3e3b00076cdeb90580b850eb8c"],"title":"Are Private Schools Better Than Public Schools?

In this article, we consider an extension of the multivariate nonlinear mixed-effects model by adopting a joint multivariate-$t$ distribution for random effects and within-subject errors and taking the censoring information of multiple responses into account. The proposed model is called the multivariate-$t$ nonlinear mixed-effects model with censored responses (MtNLMMC), allowing for analyzing multi-outcome longitudinal data exhibiting nonlinear growth patterns with censorship and fat-tailed behavior. Utilizing the Taylor-series linearization method, a pseudo-data version of expectation conditional maximization either (ECME) algorithm is developed for iteratively carrying out maximum likelihood estimation.

Like in both cited works, the proposed generalization is based on ordering of the ferromagnetic Potts model; the novelty of the proposed approach lies in the adjustable dependence of the antiferromagnetic term on the population of each Potts state, which interpolates between the two previously considered cases. This adjustability allows one to empirically tune the algorithm to detect the maximum number of communities of the given size and link density.

Many alternative models for counts that are overdispersed relative to Poisson have been developed to solve this issue, including the negative binomial model. In this article, the negative binomial model with a four-parameter logistic mean is proposed to handle these types of counts, with variance that flexibly depends on the mean. Various parameterizations for the variance are considered, including extra-Poisson variability modeled as an exponentiated B-spline. Thus, the proposed model ably captures the leveling off of the mean, i.e., the \"lazy-S\" shape often encountered for overdispersed dose-response counts, simultaneously taking into account both overdispersion and natural mortality. Two real datasets illustrate the merits of the proposed approach: media colony counts after tuberculosis decontamination, and the number of monkeys killed by Ache hunters over several hunting trips in the Paraguayan tropical forest.","inCitations":["f760c48b69f6c4de968617b0d486ace04f307542"],"title":"Flexible parametrization of variance functions for quantal response data derived from counts.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1293084"}

Unfortunately, these two strategies often conflict when the evaluation of the outcome cannot keep pace with the patient accrual rate and thus the interim data cannot be observed in time to make adaptive decisions. A similar logistic difficulty arises when the outcome is late-onset. Based on a novel formulation and approximation of the likelihood of the observed data, we propose a general methodology for model-assisted designs to handle toxicity data that are pending due to fast accrual or late-onset toxicity and facilitate seamless decision making in phase I dose-finding trials. The proposed time-to-event model-assisted designs consider each dose separately and the dose-escalation/de-escalation rules can be tabulated before the trial begins, which greatly simplifies trial conduct in practice compared to that under existing methods. We show that the proposed designs have desirable finite and large-sample properties and yield performance that is comparable to that of more complicated model-based designs. We provide user-friendly software for implementing the designs.","inCitations":["4f8d7ad66144917f3beb663b0b14d074f2d924c5","c9464cbe1306cf784f641c47026ccd63af5bf6e6"],"title":"Time-to-event model-assisted designs for dose-finding trials with delayed toxicity.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz007"}

We consider the decision of whether to gather data at an intermediate design point: do the gains from learning about nonlinearity outweigh the loss in efficiency in estimating the linear effect? Under reasonable assumptions about nonlinearity, we find that, unless sample size is very large, the design with no interior measurements is best, because with moderate total sample sizes, any nonlinearity in the dose-response will be difficult to detect.

Because microarray studies typically involve thousands of genes, we propose a two-stage method for parameter estimation. The interaction terms for genes and experimental conditions in this model capture all relevant information about differential gene expression in the microarray data. We propose a mixture distribution model for a summary statistic of differential expression that consists of null and alternative component distributions. The mixture model suggests two methods for identifying genes exhibiting differential expression. One is a frequentist method that identifies distinguished genes and the other an empirical Bayes procedure that yields estimated posterior probabilities of differential expression, conditional on observed microarray readings.","inCitations":["b0127de4b846ad3e6bc1004fef964c6878be9926","4d65e9ceb2981fc081f42544b5110ccd07d28976","6ae878cb5672fad8e32994c9aa976d18ccbb9b35","9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f","9be2499d3e082fbceb90484826d8c034e46e4b0f","f84f60f9134669fb5b7cf8e6a757e6194231f457","d65ab6603658382103f1883c30fc0dea849667fb","f0c8fc8ab280846d0e4e107adc6f115bddf37200","5508f7597d63b95ade057893f2e5495187a469b7","cf649507937bb1ccad5d73f8531c3e34f2bed89f","5aad68aa29276d9182f38aa73589558b420da094","deda9572dd312075052f3850ac56b9732b0d4475","a6fbeee300d7f684a8b83c2f86d650501cb7de5d","d56a91c6f55570ae43ac9b2b1d78bbe7264e5b21","d58ee78578385ccd60e4b02069ab1213dfa0be52","ce993b2030489430f798a60456910de4d7ff0612","9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005","205b115cf8d842d6da087ca79d1c68c355eb9a9e","5d369c73a17205c3009b025e14fdde6d2b288ffe","0efc8d3287aad719f1bda5f6cf0ee9eccdb48519","7b47cc8c7570bd0d70b7ac58a9348dcb1d4a2c88","3f95be7aed26568594c2929fc6ce10144d52944c","e2a187c6ec22b531a438bfa65b679b9a1a87597d","aab96a351f79a21294404595951bcfe08702149e","47d31d91fa9ebb925957414b39b08d4a8902e9ca","41faf05f5d933df6d2ff02138e3e4bb18a720773","996810d4b0c658cad5ca862dd15d9748aab2ae1d","cd9e9628f2265bf40e5a789db7570e894e7dcefa"],"title":"Models for microarray gene expression data.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120005737"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"The paper describes a Bayesian spatial discrete time survival model to estimate the effect of air pollution on the risk of preterm birth. The standard approach treats prematurity as a binary outcome and cannot effectively examine time varying exposures during pregnancy. Time varying exposures can arise either in short-term lagged exposures due to seasonality in air pollution or long-term cumulative exposures due to changes in length of exposure. Our model addresses this challenge by viewing gestational age as time-to-event data where each pregnancy becomes at risk at a prespecified time (e.g. the 28th week). The pregnancy is then followed until either a birth occurs before the 37th week (preterm), or it reaches the 37th week, and a full-term birth is expected. The model also includes a flexible spatially varying baseline hazard function to control for unmeasured spatial confounders and to borrow information across areal units. The approach proposed is applied to geocoded birth records in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, for the period 2001-2005.We examine the risk of preterm birth that is associated with total cumulative and 4-week lagged exposure to ambient fine particulate matter.","inCitations":["6ab41942bc50a47e30145989cc769f62353faf00","cfb307cdb003c1efc46571e278bfa243e8634c55","e421295b473289f26271ac94dadd87438f6c44cd","5d7e7c1e8b4801d458bfd7269d4a367faeaf9c95","b0e70edea2c81307e44c14dd8863685c89c73027","a458c7df03cf51ecc9ccd7a72d76a57822861349","7c142e2b808ea1bf591221fd22c1ce8f9bb2497f","ca6718d8bfa5a232b81660766d7863f89aee1c53"],"title":"A spatial time-to-event approach for estimating associations between air pollution and preterm birth.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2012.01056.x"}

These data manipulations, referred to as preprocessing, can influence the quality of the ultimate measurements. In the last few years, the high-throughput measurement of gene expression is the most popular application of microarray technology. For this application, various groups have demonstrated that the use of modern statistical methodology can substantially improve accuracy and precision of the gene expression measurements, relative to ad hoc procedures introduced by designers and manufacturers of the technology. Currently, other applications of microarrays are becoming more and more popular. In this paper, we describe a preprocessing methodology for a technology designed for the identification of DNA sequence variants in specific genes or regions of the human genome that are associated with phenotypes of interest such as disease. In particular, we describe a methodology useful for preprocessing Affymetrix single-nucleotide polymorphism chips and obtaining genotype calls with the preprocessed data. We demonstrate how our procedure improves existing approaches using data from 3 relatively large studies including the one in which large numbers of independent calls are available.

It is well known that the breast cancer survival varies by age at diagnosis. For most cancers, the relative survival decreases with age but breast cancer may have the unusual age pattern. In order to reveal the stage risk and age effects pattern, we propose the semiparametric accelerated failure time partial linear model and develop its estimation method based on the P-spline and the rank estimation approach. The simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method is comparable to the parametric approach when data is not contaminated, and more stable than the parametric methods when data is contaminated. By applying the proposed model and method to the breast cancer data set of Atlantic county, New Jersey from SEER program, we successfully reveal the significant effects of stage, and show that women diagnosed around 38s have consistently higher survival rates than either younger or older women.","inCitations":["47398cc9c62515e7d7e7836b15927151c865bc0e","0ff65c52655aaef7c59702b033dac013e83d41b6"],"title":"A semiparametric accelerated failure time partial linear model and its application to breast cancer","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2010.10.012"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Distributed lag models (DLMs) have been widely used in environmental epidemiology to quantify the lagged effects of air pollution on a health outcome of interest such as mortality and morbidity. Most previous DLM approaches only consider one pollutant at a time. In this article, we propose distributed lag interaction model (DLIM) to characterize the joint lagged effect of two pollutants. One natural way to model the interaction surface is by assuming that the underlying basis functions are tensor products of the basis functions that generate the main-effect distributed lag functions. We extend Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom interaction structure to the two-dimensional DLM context. We also consider shrinkage versions of the two to allow departure from the specified Tukey's interaction structure and achieve bias-variance tradeoff. We derive the marginal lag effects of one pollutant when the other pollutant is fixed at certain quantiles. In a simulation study, we show that the shrinkage methods have better average performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE) across different scenarios. We illustrate the proposed methods by using the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) data to model the joint effects of PM10 and O3 on mortality count in Chicago, Illinois, from 1987 to 2000.","inCitations":["3b76bffb915e5070f20772ee507820526903907d","97910baab5e31bf57a6232b436fa28979ebdff08"],"title":"Distributed Lag Interaction Models with Two Pollutants.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12297"}

In practice, a model is at best only an approximation to the real world. It is important to know whether the estimates of SEs as provided by standard software are consistent when a model is misspecified, and to understand why if not. Bootstrap procedures provide nonparametric estimates of SEs that automatically account for distribution violation. It is also necessary to know whether bootstrap estimates of SEs are consistent. This paper studies the relationship between the bootstrap estimates of SEs and those based on asymptotics. Examples are used to illustrate various versions of asymptotic variance-covariance matrices and their validity. Conditions for the consistency of the bootstrap estimates of SEs are identified and discussed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the relationship of different estimates of SEs and covariance matrices.","inCitations":["e355a22503882d9d4e96bc7273cdb7aa19c8812e","169a76c94747a1b713c008d6e26eb492d9d9f691","3c2d528245c0e00d2ad1d80ea08cdc8f6b9df480","0111c0b20044abeddd853e80aaa82b47154737f9","fe68a6257bd1a95e8203eefb9471c0e5ff095050","baa9592987bc9ab0f34228d8b4dadd0c14622a96","3beffe8ba5916c82253849bae3dcb376a2b7d8ae","9ae07e571095a11f1efe26bf5c12142f12a5313f","810cb842cdf2e0c471efc5e9004b2eb666bec8c7","7f4344b501d25a15a0dc7fdfe88385739bef411f","6e879d2bd118868fe054ad7d1613c35b2329b664","53bee0858170dc871eb452fdfa2fb2d040a5ba0a","e8d04113cf4b944590509f45d0ba3d7a6b13b4cb","f790ee904a95b41297628d8049defbb80a3919c4","f68a2b89f038799aa44ce477088becffb71bba06","793a3a908d4890821824ceb82ea09d02d08a2543","e9602a4208c665e58ed937de1fb3a83ab49bd26b"],"title":"Standard errors in covariance structure models: asymptotics versus bootstrap.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X85896"}

If two different new drugs are approved with the λ-margin approach by using the same active control, it implies that four noninferiority trials share the same active control.

In this paper we investigate how much such dependencies inflate the unconditional and conditional across-trial type I error rates, and we propose a new procedure to adjust the inflated unconditional across-trial type I error rates.","inCitations":["42d73217f5d86f14158c5d6fe59a567f396e312b"],"title":"The adjustment of the type I error rate in noninferiority trials with λ-margin approach: each of two different new drugs is approved with two independent trials with the same active control.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.482683"}

We show that the item distributions under a skew-normal factor are equivalent to those under a quadratic model up to third-order moments. The reverse only holds if the quadratic loadings are equal to each other and within certain bounds. We illustrate that observed data which follow any skew-normal factor model can be so well approximated with the quadratic factor model that the models are empirically indistinguishable, and that the reverse does not hold in general. The choice between the two models to account for deviations of normality is illustrated by an empirical example from clinical psychology.","inCitations":["ca4707daeb19361389c2825626b5d2611103f3f2","dbb83b274ed94c3094a14232b88ff66f4c805d54"],"title":"Modelling non-normal data: The relationship between the skew-normal factor model and the quadratic factor model.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12062"}

This paper proposes structure-activity maps and transformation-effect maps for directly visualizing the structure-activity relationships. The maps are illustrated using the hypotensive activities of clonidine analogs and the sweet taste of Perillartine analogs.","inCitations":["9c01ff135a20ebaf551058ea7bd3eb5599ae187a","bb4cfb5a58b710d5faccbd891f2eeef400b86c53","27333f40b1460f030019dee823d25dbb24131381","24ec6486418f0ed0d3288051e5de6768dced8353","ea89a42978c27da1acce0402b004d266f0e58502","3be09492e015d465c7f8ca76dfe2d0d85e402b65","97a28f1385254db572dec5e8ec908e44a33a7dc2","56859915b80d9d565bf49d6c0cebb87195114652","259e93dde7ce0414b1d5c4d77840a1b96fdadb94","a293543541813878d3129256e4418cffad917b96","7218a002e9e3055e0362782df8c98e33ee1e1723","ecbde28c0d418869da8e38ffb94ecded4f4e0358","a2d9d1e8c16556252164bcb132d7ac901073b948","c1604bf71ba5ac18f4b4cf64e77abf66f71fd3ad","3a2c40e3f869c6765d29cefa775c8e4eedcc053f","19d38265a4336590a18f474db57021fcb1c5d9b4","17d8bca23c9d0a74c2cc8dcda9f6b2e7d5334a32","a7466f546c3dd0e1fb993b1b124d235aee126a99","a1f123574f8dc47ccff7d8e32782cd6e40e89c1f","23a50e76bc38ef66448342ee365f193da6e25ef9","71ce7d896094134d08a5e563e0b4b3145a90df33","a8782c02650eb74e7c9418b6df5a7045673b8aa9","dc42393f93c1e809cdb3d55e209b58bd4b00d612","1ae778aef4698df9c50483609db4d86f6597eacd","fd99579c15aeab721127870384483250f6dfc865","6b605f6724c72347903261f1934b310b0caf0315","c29410a427f7b6de08e613daf71d6c12373facde","5788fdcd54e3b351aee35720a269945b101398fc","edab8c1cabf3793900a84ca3b411d5ff9469e667","5b9f7c1bc04d1b3e671ecd7e2810057515c96da4","6ed37c41c3a231e780f79c389bef9835194277cc","1974756e5c5b5fb786aa5bf0f18bcda5b82b4cbc","6dc4ed7d02eb2ac07ff68c5aff9347212fb3c8fe","f527794eac0057f68cc3d7127bf370200e738abb","af323eb655f5147f5965864332d64ea7c042e71b","b276839bc5df8ead8878f20fa893850316c4714d","da95a9d5e3b0dae5e401544f86b93e6ce2e6e3eb","9c6c08f47d5452f4714a4e2a1f23d97c4ab234f9","f50b721b4ae2941fc10af2151b7b0a2b404ba201","9e3717a7d9c8c30d48c0adf60cf070b2a2a11fc6","642e798824182e00543ee69b886e0feb026271a3","2f4d467faea4f5f3fc31745566580f253e75c40f","03c08ad51d65a7727aa8491afc6d2f525ee5cadb","e9249b0b08393bc3fee1297350765c6051d59b17","7ec71f627a52637cca79e1700117dd572594875d","dcfbced54beb7ee13c36b608f6ee2224302905aa","296ed1f07e03bb453b67df7457067cc52f39099c","36cc81e318663c061af3cf99ec791b92a869a057","34f1d7ba2c28cc89cae1694357ee8210ebbb79df","4dc5734ed10c75ba3f33398fa842a9ad11a60c58","98f59f8db825094126e6920b788f72a48d68c047","a1a9fe6751de32f156be5c8ec57ae494abc0c93f","6246c2e6c6865ccdfc5548290df2d834b8a547c0","2f16a438ce5d6b4bb229f18cc0018f45bff7aa79","34d6027f46a2ffeae98a840598e387edee2f4c30","e24ba136becf90844cd957bce9e1a864d8e1cb1b","f6ca59bcf4eabfb2e6b5a0c761215c9afe651238","a2e05e53b286a670b867ccd84704f77a5ed32e44","bf668d87fc342c73ed0074d4e307955d930cc4e5","29ddcf068def797607faee4a077ba942f8319ed4","f3e17864ae466be859ce05b610191f8047f49de5","8fc9e3e613e81563c7d35f15fbae0ff00e2d7344","c336690f19b754019927cdc8571afba0f893e236","2d03134ca6c45f5493f9cc17bc54a848e844603c","5b00752cc5162a273841defe31a52994694c266c","2ee0601cbbc2a2a0be5a6d2e579499bee11a4d95","a1756c2b970e8a472adbaf873f2e3f64bf44d30c","822f60b9b270b498ef694462f85a5c917d0ab157","200f282489b02d6fa7a130abe805a2569f36ef3e","7784862fe19539ffa0cd75f3475faa32e998bfb8","efc77f077ab4e117942b0c3e7ac5e315aaf40dd7","4fe161459de37297fe83530def35570afb5d908f","916f1918dec0467e2bdba33d8d7e0c1a1ab7187c","823607b8bbe97120c35ea3bcf86d2cd3fa122ef8"],"title":"Structure-activity maps for visualizing the graph variables arising in drug design.","doi":"10.1080/10543409308835060"}
