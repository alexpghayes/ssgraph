An incomplete factorial design may be employed to evaluate some combination drugs because of resource constraints and priorities. In this paper, we compare the powers for four different patterns of sample size allocations in two incomplete factorial designs, with two combination drug doses and fixed total sample size. A hierarchical closed testing procedure is employed for the treatment comparisons of interest as a method to control type I error for multiple comparisons. The overall cumulative powers of contradicting all null hypotheses at a particular stage of the hierarchy and all preceding stages are determined by simulation for the respective stages of the hierarchy. The purpose is to identify the allocation of sample size so as to enable better power in a hierarchical evaluation of comparisons.","inCitations":["a64d5954a0336a722890731bf515601966b24b32","e484ec634199c6e37006010f05ee71cf54b11063"],"title":"Cumulative statistical power for hierarchical comparisons to evaluate two combination drug doses.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802071428"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2002,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"We describe a non-parametric optimal design as a theoretical gold standard for dose finding studies. Its purpose is analogous to the Cramer-Rao bound for unbiased estimators, i.e. it provides a bound beyond which improvements are not generally possible. The bound applies to the class of non-parametric designs where the data are not assumed to be generated by any known parametric model. Whenever parametric assumptions really hold it may be possible to do better than the optimal non-parametric design. The goal is to be able to compare any potential dose finding scheme with the optimal non-parametric benchmark. This paper makes precise what is meant by optimal in this context and also why the procedure is described as non-parametric.","inCitations":["2a2dd52914a3b7ba0bfa6443d3398e00db7012bd","74810189af4412f31aa1c18393c7951ca76ce803","ca695cc71ea4b92b1816ae8704b50d6a1fdbf4ed","3859ab9dd0d0aec7eeceb1258e41ca61a9aed051","8d73cb1dde9d31f22047df57de96e87f9d6bc424","3344b5afd48007deb997aed992925f14353a589a","2cf5202916a14aec7509e0542fde2de7bc3086f1","18b1e1048967b301c18de3734acb99169f1195e5","e552ff58b72bc7d245ee84b0ea3cdd6270d359ca","93bda8023fca958f24e967d956280b98e2d5a570","965fedba92267aa46d4089149480ad2ef45b2a74","99ea5a48120f7bae4aea43eb4054f89c74c0b5dd","a988def5a95b29aac4e032ca577adf404031492a","870ac68e808f82d5698ef39797d81cee19b5ca84","bd531110007c526d7da833dee8f130724b16208a","1fbdbea3205b532a6d9139839743b00631d5d1a5","76c5a09e0f4007d46c535c7985dcd9c070229fdc","0972eec3009d20a9b203fb92aba2e72d890c6519","53f96062cdb6c06b74f2b6106f9ce3415a9aafa0","8f68ff6d37c52217d9a1158442bf0526ec198c2e","54f3519aa79ab76e19836b3af0e6e32eb8f4fa16","37a91ce799a5c6b5537700b186d3fdbcb4d9b5b5","3e10c60716d9a705d8fd2b12c31f3ba717b23d70","642a1d5af0bcff630301d2c8e16a75aa55885282","4fa17e4769397970ed029b5e987c6f88063e14cf","0ac9a723ddff190b372054caa6715e3b7ce32545","eac4a78c30c8e5374a88dd3e894a4a812e679cc7","88a81da5e82359cab83a69c59a70b848858e3230"],"title":"Non-parametric optimal design in dose finding studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.1.51"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2014,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"BACKGROUND\nInferentially seamless studies are one of the best-known adaptive trial designs. Statistical inference for these studies is a well-studied problem. Regulatory guidance suggests that statistical issues associated with study conduct are not as well understood. Some of these issues are caused by the need for early pre-specification of the phase III design and the absence of sponsor access to unblinded data. Before statisticians decide to choose a seamless IIb/III design for their programme, they should consider whether these pitfalls will be an issue for their programme.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe consider four case studies. Each design met with varying degrees of success. We explore the reasons for this variation to identify characteristics of drug development programmes that lend themselves well to inferentially seamless trials and other characteristics that warn of difficulties.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeamless studies require increased upfront investment and planning to enable the phase III design to be specified at the outset of phase II. Pivotal, inferentially seamless studies are unlikely to allow meaningful sponsor access to unblinded data before study completion. This limits a sponsor's ability to reflect new information in the phase III portion.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhen few clinical data have been gathered about a drug, phase II data will answer many unresolved questions. Committing to phase III plans and study designs before phase II begins introduces extra risk to drug development. However, seamless pivotal studies may be an attractive option when the clinical setting and development programme allow, for example, when revisiting dose selection.","inCitations":["7e64cf63348f22dedeb10a3cc07a64288e4d2669","9eaafa0299415a356c2e5687e410dfcb6144092a","3a1c62946a1ca57fc0e96cb701e061614d347fa5","54bf4d7b750e3366a9569b220bdb6ff64aae6819","bac0b8e416958383fce052f581f0ce560179643f","c6646aafe31f7487a50bd7374927df3053c78271","fc8d8a623db6b51922c6cd61d882e6e2861461be","f0a90c2e6c1ffff5b3924a621cc2e74973cef70e","9ffa0ae498e6ad395b4f8a6b7ffcbd0020cfcb90","8182a4f2f6acdd9d46b8040b4af3287bae107204","df87e32023be0c4432fbc549035291c2a386782a","d9e31a98efa9bc2a51e5db635750753e034c16e9","0b156077d10c8377fe0feaa8cc093fa99d38ee4e","1bd38ff15657d58eeaf5f390625f426fa52599ac","ae041a3569dbc7552f33b63426fb77e859f85e85","863c0e499d88d323ae4727944687cb1a10ec28fa","517f78963f8f5d7191017acfe55eb8be3c2560eb"],"title":"When is a seamless study desirable?

This belief is strong and persists even in the face of data demonstrating that it is clearly wrong. In this paper, we present two powerful teaching examples illustrating the dangers of small experiments guided by scientific intuition. We describe two, simple, two-dimensional spaces. These two spaces give rise to, and at the same time appear to generate supporting data for, scientific intuitions that are deeply flawed or wholly incorrect. We find these spaces useful in unfreezing scientific thinking and challenging the misplaced confidence in scientific intuition.","inCitations":["ccfa773978bdb439fc94e1b3eb746edf354fea35","77f8e86b7f0f107e81789834f2a4f7e3155c3382"],"title":"Teaching examples for the design of experiments: geographical sensitivity and the self-fulfilling prophecy.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1723"}

The decision to proceed or not to large expensive Phase 3 trials has significant implications to both patients and sponsors alike. Recent experience has shown that Phase 3 failure rates remain high. We present a flexible Bayesian quantitative decision-making paradigm that evaluates evidence relative to achieving a multilevel target product profile. A framework for operating characteristics is provided that allows the drug developer to design a proof-of-concept trial in light of its ability to support decision-making rather than merely achieve statistical significance. Operating characteristics are shown to be superior to traditional p-value-based methods. In addition, discussion related to sample size considerations, application to interim futility analysis and incorporation of prior historical information is evaluated.","inCitations":["54fd483dbf0cbafa613a232bbbc741e3c43f2962","c7912d650b6fe98787ca6c52edc24d008f5b355a"],"title":"A Bayesian paradigm for decision-making in proof-of-concept trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1289947"}

However, valid analyses of longitudinal data can be problematic when subjects discontinue (dropout) prior to completing the study. This study assessed the merits of likelihood-based repeated measures analyses (MMRM) compared with fixed-effects analysis of variance where missing values were imputed using the last observation carried forward approach (LOCF) in accounting for dropout bias. Comparisons were made in simulated data and in data from a randomized clinical trial. Subject dropout was introduced in the simulated data to generate ignorable and nonignorable missingness. Estimates of treatment group differences in mean change from baseline to endpoint from MMRM were, on average, markedly closer to the true value than estimates from LOCF in every scenario simulated. Standard errors and confidence intervals from MMRM accurately reflected the uncertainty of the estimates, whereas standard errors and confidence intervals from LOCF underestimated uncertainty.","inCitations":["5c1ca56091734e40d64ffa8eaef0b448e3d433f6","18990fa6c5c0fd9110311fe3616d36a7c77671c0","cf044929d05b7faac23a54d0bc4074ae69df6d7b","5867c568b93838267fecf79d449221e6c41527b9","79eedfb42f5a4944166c49d840e0051450f7b839","d47934d68ec40ad20f15bb9f3e133a103d9fd3d3","7ce25bbb9b23b9b7c636882e4ace881e77da4e31","e383dcefa41357d5c464f65fbfdc2cbe4c1e4188","112755f153907f79b0b5ebe8ff32e0f8a443798f","ff5b020a5227fda188a189b94dbf0085c03f16b5","4327a6a9eb954dd915a1706242fb030c612ced0b","25b3faeb7bf00cddee7ac8543dbd6e5215ef7537","3828a50bac8b36baec4ea53bdaa9b6cd5ee701ce","5893ddff4ff4c24aca269af3f2b4a147c53ff099","c96ca4e9548801c38a64653e289b2966dfffab29","ae1fe57c387b2a51136c8bd00bfbc1dc769b352f","93d428e7ca8cb9cef3685bd109de926bf411ee5b","354818cebfb297113f40a3bf172e22da72d23f18","1f8180df44e3008f94806e41f1a6764465cc378e","960b92cf598c2e3d244f862d7688d76bc3bcef8c","0e5a527e0f4ad9e5f939eabf070c914dfd770322","2acfb111f0796767b65b0deed1fbab4f3e6983ba","5ee38e2cee6a7b9b31e42bf6c6dc3a6c6e81a158","d325934265e498c5271b3691266ec4a5cea9110a","1d314afd85987c58756ea93a5c1a29344bd23c07","97f887d1e68f8b1d552ce0e57e7ac303abc25183","ada3ae0b411b3a6fa316fe59c93295d8c25eb969","da248e37465b04399b21563f4980a3c85d2e04bc","ecc9b230f5984f98e683018c3ea1c49bba8da2f7","42b84093b0b29db6cf633a583ef3a2942124ec26","0ae4737dd4247f7930f08b30da764dfc82deb758","bc79d3a66b29638e15576d9b1642ff316b96153d","c9b813a20b67802d290bd448bb9421a161d875d2","26467e7d68bdaab07e30ad69e609ccfcc428ab30","8896f23be3bb4adc5ac2da380dfcc79cca4a36b3","faab98d6911f98e480e2cb019dc8b9b4086453f0","82ca167d299eba50a04c557adc945f9679f87317","28854a12ddc1f2631aac59b5115b2fdda72f561b","ebe42e7812a95e458fc87d51bc127ced126c3978","3ace06ed3d17d17d8314a106c78e283dc526729d","c3e9ced587903f9bd500bbabfed741cb519f5534","c07b0d72ee907cd8793502d0babf30f1f5f68faa","3f4f274ca9466dc04dc2c3cf2f1f08d701f19661","22c41a8547468c91ba8733342fe0da923833b25b","883c803fcc8378bd7abfcbe6f55a76964e4db086","90f82a5497dbce3d652c1c904c3a5775484d3bb7","9bd1ee1b67dddb7431d707ec3c540cc4f592f911","32504c154995a345727d0aa7e8e15f83c5c61548","f95e1bce46cbe16bda942f099b86ab476dc58327","63782c9117219741961daccc2d057b9034519088","cb543cbd34b795ee1c16d3392bedbb80653fb74e","167438480dc24b32041db15a78a2e4419b2b1421","aacc2bafaeabb5b749e2c8925d58442cc2bb5cc1","f334c4266e74ebbfec2f036d5969dc71093c3bc2","78a99b64e0725d55626c94d7214ed9031b1f5d6a","4eb0d0f8766184cce74354fac9b0affdbb9fa4d2","835e78c2a7ed1671d76b73207272aafc223b5a18","c8e181d649b3cc0c81ee6e4f95b08b73f3b233d2","22b30d4d268b1dd49e40c7bf323c488edb91f5f1","b7cf9eaec72e2f0a49335a3a9810c4a46ea18ff1","6fb88b86446e038dfb8d37a1b464a19c30260060","9cd06746d0bab2d9cb9257ae59caffc9a4640e05","9e8cb49a63ab26534fad058c3316f58c974f0458","84be4dca4bf66842afd959492c04ddc88cc7799b","894a0c79cadaabea2899f3d33d4c499d73565d3a","fbc7324ac68692e5e302ebe1aa3f7871cee31529","501069eace8b73dd49a87a2010654e67c52b8dce","9f337dec1e88346c6173fe1b20e3310b3f1a8d23","1342538d1ec959d484c8e7c689395fb0d1198f46","28de791a3f8c49c927e8a7fba783200c0f924175","3a956c1988f54fd0b018c678d1134579f485d780","40eba92a7c4c3e761c1aeb027651e64381005750","7d419acb006506fe75832aa0599a6dc87a9a8235","9274527eb25826d307c8611dadddd9beb7d5b215","ce67ec10c99c4ae252c4e91af1ffa7b8ea1f61cf","189e68ab395ef3e9a37f224c50fda41588dacec5","39092a77ffa6be199c3115c3eb710756e769b709","de1239431deeeb7e9e0800cfa5f4e4419c3de290","ef65bf49829d3228c7447c99354cd0eb6472b6c7","522a9fb358152ec9d745f8abdf1c5f02cdc21d0a","416832f8beb0897d5eab38f0a7056d62896c637f","96d982c89ae51db71b0d47a8a627c6dffaf04531","f2a213fa339f99450bb6cdb03efb132ea1221052","67b113133379a0e38bd8e9fd1c5ee93e50eff3f7","9eacf4260482a4f8e3ad0e530a1831a84ad14f02","eedb6c9930376ffdb9692cf1c157f73cda74f2d6","3224fb1d4f5e24abcf2a21f9cfe4e3e19e0855d3","e74dfe2152b19cdc5a27507b17336b2246aaaea1","5301899ec4edc5f50a5457d8a7803df19a604357","85fe9dced2252ccf8bba0ad9f0c4a2ad9a9a869a","1e325d535e0149fa70493a239b521b8341b3704e","16ee5e54a37f458693726bcfb347058761daa468","3c1e04905393a286ed69b1769472bf9eacb9e533","3c7a95b7dc9b83255e53b16b647a34a5c360a0be","fc1cbccc79997fb356f7eccae447b2b87c172138","4bb9542c2f3028c2906a7c93be8a7e32f0220fb2","5e9ce68926f033fe52163f1bfd0ff72069ff0820","91a44c4ebcff032e552ddd87bbdc03f21f37071d","0e3840a1c803c6698a5c277b9a7d71e576d9a25b","7ad55b1e6d3e6780e38894e8cacbfab2d6affcff","b16fbf275f1be1a96bd19a85f4abb67617089b6d","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","7c665175b668e67867cdee39fb7cec2ef37827ba","e6d07ac6c93d417b5a8827c5ecc438bf3937a15a","4de00497e72110be54a0205d69b88135f46f6169","fa407ded15751d6eede6f9196c70f7c17ac57b42","f2dc8ccb00efa1f052b944927d96f286f3e2b3aa","4ffeb1de59300172965e07530c9f5217a88379b6","39917eaa20bf7663b1defbf4e6a61a5b9be6aa87","7e9c71addc37f7c9c8e081448609ca7d3ff12d46","34d67d354d9b14b6926fce33458346ed37f40298","a9a0bf5969d349a92c1f416d2764eeceb3abc087","fea33ffc72f8f913346b801c7d375956478e5cb6","a028a043e20dc9d566e21be5db52307beb35e7f0","be60ca920f3109e3e6eb8bdd64ad81e7002b251a","27f6b14f7ec5b9a2feddea6b9

This article introduces a Bayesian method that identifies the information required for planning a PoC and the process of sample size calculation. The results will be presented in terms of the relationships between the regulatory requirements, the probability of reaching the regulatory requirements, the goalpost for PoC, and the sample size used for PoC.","inCitations":["40031da6aa532f1afb99c0dd8eb6ee7c2bf59df2","418e749eb2753b46e2dcc53b1095d8a665d758aa","9ca5cf7fe9bd1a689e42d29f88fe028e86b35bb4","488f48cce3248882b1122992f63729171f301bce","41b4a9ae7217c14442da4e8487c6884a0a445df8","ef4102e23394bbf801ce5ecf45e495f330ce5ee8","9fd029788247136f12bc266a95736f83305bcb6a"],"title":"Sample size calculation for a proof of concept study.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120015748"}

There has been a serge in research activities in this area in recent years since a number of researchers are working to develop and extend rank based procedures to clustered dependent data which include situations with known correlation structures (e.g., as in mixed effects models) as well as more general form of dependence.The purpose of this paper is to test the symmetry of a marginal distribution under clustered data. However, unlike most other papers in the area, we consider the possibility that the cluster size is a random variable whose distribution is dependent on the distribution of the variable of interest within a cluster. This situation typically arises when the clusters are defined in a natural way (e.g., not controlled by the experimenter or statistician) and in which the size of the cluster may carry information about the distribution of data values within a cluster.Under the scenario of an informative cluster size, attempts to use some form of variance adjusted sign or signed rank tests would fail since they would not maintain the correct size under the distribution of marginal symmetry. To overcome this difficulty Datta and Satten (2008; Biometrics, 64, 501-507) proposed a Wilcoxon type signed rank test based on the principle of within cluster resampling. In this paper we study this problem in more generality by introducing a class of valid tests employing a general score function. Asymptotic null distribution of these tests is obtained. A simulation study shows that a more general choice of the score function can sometimes result in greater power than the Datta and Satten test; furthermore, this development offers the user a wider choice. We illustrate our tests using a real data example on spinal cord injury patients.","inCitations":["ada71f602d2d621daac851dd787a29eac2946671","7b0ec56c91e9462f8d0571664885e0c78ed75b88"],"title":"A General Class of Signed Rank Tests for Clustered Data when the Cluster Size is Potentially Informative.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2012.672647"}

This is particularly the case when data are subject to missingness and measurement error. To address this important problem, we propose marginal methods that simultaneously carry out model selection and estimation for longitudinal data with missing responses and error-prone covariates. Our method have several appealing features: the applicability is broad because the methods are developed for a unified framework with marginal generalized linear models; model assumptions are minimal in that no full distribution is required for the response process and the distribution of the mismeasured covariates is left unspecified; and the implementation is straightforward. To justify the proposed methods, we provide both theoretical properties and numerical assessments.","inCitations":["c069a2cab44ad228e39941c133ddd6090032ffbd","5eef4a1425a1859cfba9bc78b43a4bbfb02cee23","a2aff26d84860ad0c5b1154bf3c2b48ca9f72898"],"title":"Variable Selection and Inference Procedures for Marginal Analysis of Longitudinal Data with Missing Observations and Covariate Measurement Error.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.11268"}

Methods are developed for the modelling and estimation of nonlinear conditional quantile functions when data are clustered within two-level nested designs. The proposed estimation algorithm is a blend of a smoothing algorithm for quantile regression and a second order Laplacian approximation for nonlinear mixed models. This optimization approach has the appealing advantage of reducing the original nonsmooth problem to an approximated L 2 problem. While the estimation algorithm is iterative, the objective function to be optimized has a simple analytic form. The proposed methods are assessed through a simulation study and two applications, one in pharmacokinetics and one related to growth curve modelling in agriculture.","inCitations":["f73f5aefe0a66b44a1457616e047e02e42d2f1c7","c17f66c042f3d1e90c9d0eba62a577a5132cc0d7"],"title":"Modelling and estimation of nonlinear quantile regression with clustered data","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2018.12.005"}

The SIDES method introduced in Lipkovich et al. (2011) adopts a recursive partitioning algorithm for screening treatment-by-biomarker interactions. This article introduces an improved biomarker discovery/subgroup search method (SIDEScreen). The SIDEScreen method relies on a two-stage procedure that first selects a small number of biomarkers with the highest predictive ability based on an appropriate variable importance score and then identifies subgroups with enhanced treatment effect based on the selected biomarkers. The two-stage approach helps increase the signal-to-noise ratio by screening out noninformative biomarkers. We evaluate operating characteristics of the standard SIDES method and two SIDEScreen procedures based on fixed and adaptive screens. Our main finding is that the adaptive SIDEScreen method is a more flexible biomarker discovery tool than SIDES and it better handles multiplicity in complex subgroup search problems. The methods presented in the article are illustrated using a clinical trial example.","inCitations":["7354275dd2701bcee296c9ed10269b107ad15b4a","80c723d637ef64f7e05c3f160d0a3a6cf1bdad66","e7bf4d0f240085bafabd72bf1258f0b131d6b48c","b1de71a6e86c1b727e43110eeda1caeef487c140","3c97baaa910b618a2e02aa376feddefdb077637b","6e6388723fd068bdce0ac3afd49ee4991ad5a1f2","f930cf612f0b226135b636bbf9fa4d2f5440c3ee","761acc40fb4752d32046cda40d4de5c29db7a0ac","cbefd0db702c77bf27064b4ec55260048bc4d213","8b40ad2368f884ab7c12ba2b8674db8a7157fdbb","271a0f59ac21dfcfcc777091eb0c273f7835e3bc","5736ec3d0611bd5170fe6dda3209218a0b533fe8","37ee9023dd89a151f88671b4bd950ab2286483ed","577fbfed13158a95af7da93b5f99fdcba5d3e469","2822cd4f41962615b1ae6e1a8480a3c4afe1b33f","9e10c7e494be2ce85a7a883c12c76028f6b88563","d03b582c6679feff7db6976a77bbd63f544a9307","a2b1414429ad1a401217369f57bd6c40608af8b0","2f910452685cc968a153a2555ed0bd4c33d43298","16d5f92c81e1113cb9bfc4c4cf59c035d8a51417","0e28cd3f243c2750a11aced853c6b410e7b9e600","8c136c9f03d82869f716d212a1b4cb97896cab48","778d4471b3b02c83cb7fd87b17f771dd90ee1847","33d4a0e810db04775b5c5a627724243dd62d608b","816f71cb8a97943f66063a67f8fa187dea106c01","5624295eebbaa7741a84a68a5056b2e7121f3829","5a6a1f8a6320dda2a2052df95d5408408623ae4f","59af6b1b2a7b1fc468472c2122fe32a1b849b96a","2d978be4ab99b4924083de721f9e81ee71c212e2","3e40507b213275f501adda4778cdfab9f4b94786","f27b46b51c2634b091c44d937b706a0030c50f0c"],"title":"Strategies for identifying predictive biomarkers and subgroups with enhanced treatment effect in clinical trials using SIDES.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.856024"}

The copula formulation also facilitates a variety of approaches to estimation and inference including composite likelihood and two-stage estimation procedures. We consider processes with Markov margins in detail, which are often suitable when chronic diseases are progressive in nature. We give special attention to the setting in which individuals are examined intermittently and transition times are consequently interval-censored. Simulation studies give empirical insight into the different methods of analysis and an application involving progression in joint damage in psoriatic arthritis provides further illustration.","inCitations":["33375db606f7c15922b651ec5f6059e020d87006","74daf3f7f0ad8833013e471e8b323b1500f4ec19","7b94b08ce683120befd209b1968fcc28fb264838","27a8be5afd720c645033939d741c9fb6498fd7ea"],"title":"Composite likelihood for joint analysis of multiple multistate processes via copulas.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu011"}

When the dates of the initiating events of these prevalent cases are ascertainable, each observed datum point consists of a backward recurrence time and a possibly censored forward recurrence time. Their sum is well known to be the left truncated lifetime. It is common to term these left truncated lifetimes \"length biased\" if the initiating event times of all the incident cases (including those not observed through the prevalent sampling scheme) follow a stationary Poisson process. Statistical inference is then said to be carried out under stationarity. Whether or not stationarity holds, a further assumption needed for estimation of the incident survivor function is the independence of the lifetimes and their accompanying truncation times. That is, it must be assumed that survival does not depend on the calendar date of the initiating event. We show how this assumption may be checked under stationarity, even though only the backward recurrence times and their associated (possibly censored) forward recurrence times are observed. We prove that independence of the lifetimes and truncation times is equivalent to equality in distribution of the backward and forward recurrence times, and exploit this equivalence as a means of testing the former hypothesis. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the power and Type 1 error rate of our proposed tests, which include a bootstrap procedure that takes into account the pairwise dependence between the forward and backward recurrence times, as well as the potential censoring of only one of the members of each pair. We illustrate our methods using data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging. We also point out an equivalence of the problem presented here to a non-standard changepoint problem.","inCitations":["d3d9d7fe7206880be636e6588019815c378ed9df","9377ab6ce0abc83001e739d9cbeb87eab49f1113"],"title":"Testing the assumptions for the analysis of survival data arising from a prevalent cohort study with follow-up","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1419"}

The example taken here is that of income redistribution across families of different sizes. The paper first investigates the simplest assumptions that can be made about family utility functions. A simple dominance criterion is then derived under the only assumptions that family functions are increasing and concave with income and the marginal utility of income increases with family size.\"","inCitations":["ab728c21eca26ea415909296b42c417fa7a9ef0c","110e5d275fa17fdb21cdadb64e8a02a2afe6a777","97920cf440a7d8983df164044752064132598ab3","0b685fdbbe08225227d06a5b40a5aef24b8123f0","6accfbce0f523a8197006281b7a1680c1974598e","1ae0b268feabc4591fd09d8d3c7765ae0b0b580d","ba0897aa6c934c381459140d41ae9c2534f0e235","f9fe67fae0249b3f2cc42aa925021ffab17d5fc5","7f06500cf08ace4b15f9f6a866cc5220d1e6732a","fdb6454cc45e4f58557ae5c1dfc2cf596a7b9c2d","af27e942a78086dcee801d78d1fee16c99bf8988","a31af880062ecda0d571591a0adb3711773a725a","6914c0e1d1672d9d2386dd1cb24e6f9c2a1a4b76","d76656d696a0474c9bf6875a5224c655386422b6","b412b3f9e0aa1595e6fb4bf6431256bba31b4431","2fa0468d3c9356a09de2ad55154affa63f15f105","d0c3dc6021f8ec5d9117c293854de40d00c920dd","e52073e13fc3d95781e62c2830328f0440a22588","7acea52f863512975ba918bf8578f49a14375300","c8de1b2af67a9df7d0d808c00aedc5b529ff2639","b2bbf2d622161c01b525b918b9a8d0f0a7a3887e","fce54c96d08cf426774cef96229c83775cd60a74","1dbc5c22454b410d52548c68f983d848c081dad3","be5918b080c6c4b5b62c62dee5e4c51ba7394abb","d936c0d9d6e8a2beee02a7766a19613976effa41","ccd45250c7841712a32989535b5f0e5cc9b167ac","0b633b60ffb55f0e8815bfaca2a2250a9f72f71e","c10cb385fc18cf47e59bb915ccd971b212e774f0","d0eba68c5bacb59799edb255d6255aaff5d19beb","0bae22dac37ca9b484ef5ce67e162cb9b8b5398d","820b15bd52882845e0c7ce4e4ed5bac595e58a85","b65aa6d0bd580199adb116c5c83dcdccf071f730","eb5b9ac75015e1d12f87e46c136951e40d0fd8af","7f2e7c3df19068833b2209085406acc8d66e2f2a","22d916cee1bde61d51341124864ccaceef70509a","bffc0ed7e85445853dd3eff67722ba36152d5c1d","6767ad3cb9e7a4f3fb9fec7b3c3fa997542acc5f","94c8499da44176113cc689e626209b62f48c39e9","3e286ce8cf4b899bcd2c49ac133e68dc12d27f85","f90f35885ed6bf3c6b64fa0cec40092969bbbbe5","904d9594db70561f026af050a38ea012212f74d6","68537dca72716d142dc0577105415dcb71b3b3a6","035ffc3ffd2955e19490f6e43242c91e1ffa164a","d496701728f09d30623e893c27c1c1f1e4912887","eb6dc67ab8f83d9adfef07847ef5747819c68127","2eb34a040996d98cb29c872ca2657a0266e9a398","f433081ed20c782f50571e3565ab19aabc033117","53fba2d8edf538d6bda332be323ac725c8e7fd3a","80109f1c1c6012f68e279fd05cb6dac9f7c241b4","83238fbe3b42c1402c24793ca770fe9b718e95e6","357198b26f45e2617bf7ecdecac405e701106e48","117b0d96cfe1d99d3af3b2404b1c47003e2997a9","3ba84a466451cd8866cd00c2ceb6f36871bf1946","ce812e5cd207ad3c6e112412b6677175ada3d5d5","9fbff10ecd0bd80bc5acc11baa3ae5a26b60cd12","7b3ca3258a0503c9624028cb352b99dc628c0719","6cb9b4a8f253252dabb395eb5b23e0622ea7a445","c64b3b36e3e322a4d6e755d2dc8f8a614566f83c","cf5c66d71317b685a8832585e68372ac0b367cef","49f85dc440db1becdeffed836a43c6dd4a0bacef","24983fef223466146eeb429b161528a1bf9f0f4d","8eb91327eef60b1053d89bd51e42886f28026986","8ad112f5b8e3a6752c0ccef5cc5b6e4d155989b7","75f3e6085b38395b0a56e50b5271b31615f9132c","e117522a98a176355e3084bc7f29383956fa4d7c","6406aa0b55e7eed8ef382c70a8788c8b51c97400","4abd7cd7a88ffb560491129b1dbdaac3a38789dc","1edfe2e336f62806b24c61df092795e9a33395c3"],"title":"Family size and social utility: income distribution dominance criteria.","doi":"10.1016/0304-4076(89)90076-6"}

In many practical biomedical problems, one is often interested in comparing a group of images or regression surfaces. In this paper, we extend the existing method of testing the equality of nonparametric curves by Dette and Neumeyer (2001) and consider a test statistic by means of an Lgrangian (2)-distance in the multi-dimensional case under a completely heteroscedastic nonparametric model. The test statistic is also extended to be used in the case of spatial correlated errors.

We develop a systematic approach for sample size determination in high-dimensional (large [Formula: see text] small [Formula: see text]) classification analysis. Our method utilizes the probability of correct classification (PCC) as the optimization objective function and incorporates the higher criticism thresholding procedure for classifier development. Further, we derive the theoretical bound of maximal PCC gain from feature augmentation (e.g. when molecular and clinical predictors are combined in classifier development). Our methods are motivated and illustrated by a study using proteomics markers to classify post-kidney transplantation patients into stable and rejecting classes.","inCitations":["6ceac3360a1d246dfcdd88105f71fc4f82ade2b1","eb74b34a1d550dab7207c554e06acded4f4c037e","92e07d92b87f57f8a48d7ce361c14560ebe9ba65","b38eeec1c63fed013262fe34286042d11bb96609"],"title":"Study design in high-dimensional classification analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw018"}

A broad consensus has emerged on the overall procyclical nature of mortality: perhaps counter-intuitively, mortality typically rises above its trend during expansions. This consensus has been tarnished by inconsistent reports on the specific age groups and mortality causes involved. We show that these inconsistencies result, in part, from the trend specifications used in previous panel models. Standard econometric panel analysis involves fitting regression models using ordinary least squares, employing standard errors which are robust to temporal autocorrelation. The model specifications include a fixed effect, and possibly a linear trend, for each time series in the panel. We propose alternative methodology based on nonlinear detrending. Applying our methodology on data for the 50 US states from 1980 to 2006, we obtain more precise and consistent results than previous studies. We find procyclical mortality in all age groups. We find clear procyclical mortality due to respiratory disease and traffic injuries. Predominantly procyclical cardiovascular disease mortality and countercyclical suicide are subject to substantial state-to-state variation. Neither cancer nor homicide have significant macroeconomic association.","inCitations":["a81df87be116dc199c3697b686ba2b378871268a","3aec3cac85c0af45f7efbcc763748f62fddee4ca","387e17ab20526bc6979bc2be896db3d8e98f56d5","04eba0a33e238fee7c5d576dd32f5e5ce26463d6","a6279666e6692f5e1c64eaafef586ea936a8faca","800949438b0257da1ae9e67a3c4a8b86cb823f30","98351fd158a9fa9dad8669e6033e97f74769cb6a","4bf079d2eaac7f40999c7b421b7e427e5581553e","a4dfda08c587f1dd47afe1aae6b5b885768bdbf4","61c56e914db2191e9ca29e80be42325cf1f01249","dd1f9c98cc9104d41829f3ad4f554babde207bc6","d764a8524552d720ab48b8c41bdb0bfb0144a753","d5d2fb7f6b9308391fb789838aa1129c3f46f8b0","78f5fb3eeb1090018720af33f0b882a3436dfd8d","864f98220899e85146d65412339fc72b0801c189","673d7e50051dfb559e1367948d0207f6bfde89d7"],"title":"Macroeconomic effects on mortality revealed by panel analysis with nonlinear trends.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS624"}

This general distributional assumption implies three specific assumptions for the parameters in the one-factor model: the common factor has a normal distribution; the residuals are homoscedastic; and the factor loadings do not vary across the common factor scale. When any of these assumptions is violated, non-normality arises in the observed data. In this paper, a model is presented based on marginal maximum likelihood to enable explicit tests of these assumptions. In addition, the model is suitable to incorporate the detected violations, to enable statistical modelling of these effects. Two simulation studies are reported in which the viability of the model is investigated. Finally, the model is applied to IQ data to demonstrate its practical utility as a means to investigate ability differentiation.","inCitations":["2eaab934d64d3e01b5375c4b92447621e8e58226","191e7f8943d45c15d23ee410962f865e5169449c","b4ead18ea5c20a001e462533947f75ddfb20babb","aad380c0504387b9c029043fabddde73c39a20d9","7ad0a6992ac760cb6b3e016532e522a44e3778ad","7957712ac92050e7091ae5ffcbc95ba51a836168","0eda5ad24772a21b7584b3500de62496820f2ad6","e762cd7d5c03741f9afec54ff5f19a9b24e984ed","b580cf1f6a3317f075d6ae6551f0f90ab9cc44b9","d2d89b578f1b34a26fe5f56aa6f2e98ffb0de1ee","8a0b2e670e780bdcef4a0a52b27b4da57d930d39","634b971047b357b7b797e0412a06780a13daafdf","00c7a99c71aeb6e893109c3a08e48b914c5e57ec","dbb83b274ed94c3094a14232b88ff66f4c805d54","9d99a2f808a99fba2f1092fa3fa2ef4f85eec0cc","616dca374abd00fb5fab72899879284cdaaa67a2","48edebbeb73c989b31b9447339ccc80ce0bddc6e","18b35b21e184ea66840fd746e44064cbfd65114c","f113070a96e9733f4b5cb08d5d22481533f1e623","9f21de17a9a0ff2f358d633a7bcb36b5380322c0","38c16a2b0e726872a899b652d0f7059033816db6","81236e76ba90d37ffafd3e77d0457250af45d9ed"],"title":"Testing and modelling non-normality within the one-factor model.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X456935"}

Key methodological features introduced include direct modeling of deposition rather than of expected deposition, the utilization of precipitation information (there is no deposition without precipitation) without having to construct a precipitation model, and the handling of point masses at 0 in the distributions of both precipitation and deposition. The result is a specification that enables spatial interpolation and temporal prediction of deposition as well as aggregation in space or time to see patterns and trends in deposition.We use weekly deposition monitoring data from the NADP/MDN (National Atmospheric Deposition Program/Mercury Deposition Network) for 2003 restricted to the eastern U.S. and Canada. Our spatio-temporal hierarchical model allows us to interpolate to arbitrary locations and, hence, to an arbitrary grid, enabling weekly deposition surfaces (with associated uncertainties) for this region. It also allows us to aggregate weekly depositions at coarser, quarterly and annual, temporal levels.","inCitations":["f9341d0d421fc6ae1973255ac47c8786674853de","edab28501beb42fc06d39b4061244f441cd0548c","2d4d6434a35e88d8f641f9e1fbee59544c4b3594","c6c9c8847853f29777957d613e01cdeae2cc1eb4","af9babe4ff665f08ffa395932f7366e581a512dd","f334098ef4385c8224a7b2a1c50d111736b9c27d"],"title":"Modeling mercury deposition through latent space-time processes.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2007.00608.x"}

For a real case example that is from a clinical trial comparing a test treatment and a control for the pain management for patients with osteoarthritis, which has all aforementioned issues, multivariate Mann-Whitney estimators with stratification adjustment are applicable to the strictly ordinal responses with stratified design. Randomization based nonparametric analysis of covariance is applied to account for the possible baseline imbalances. Several approaches that handle missing values are provided. A global test followed by a closed testing procedure controls the family wise error rate in the strong sense for the analysis of multiple endpoints. Four outcomes indicating joint pain, stiffness, and functional status were analyzed collectively and also individually through the procedures. Treatment efficacy was observed in the combined endpoint as well as in the individual endpoints. The proposed approach is effective in addressing the aforementioned problems simultaneously and straightforward to implement.","inCitations":["3517b5540cc393abab86a51b39458c378fa1d397"],"title":"Analyzing multiple endpoints in a confirmatory randomized clinical trial-an approach that addresses stratification, missing values, baseline imbalance and multiplicity for strictly ordinal outcomes.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1799"}

This approach formalizes the Lee-Carter method as a statistical model accounting for all sources of variability. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to fit the model and to sample from the posterior predictive distribution. This paper also shows how multiple imputations can be readily incorporated into the model to handle missing data and presents some possible extensions to the model. The methodology is applied to U.S. male mortality data. Mortality rate forecasts are formed for the period 1990-1999 based on data from 1959-1989. These forecasts are compared to the actual observed values. Results from the forecasts show the Bayesian prediction intervals to be appropriately wider than those obtained from the Lee-Carter method, correctly incorporating all known sources of variability. An extension to the model is also presented and the resulting forecast variability appears better suited to the observed data.","inCitations":["1b0f9d24a30e0b85166b77eef79d66fe5b6f93da","8f3bda4729acb4531169261ef0b33cccc716b2a0","5c6f11a31c0ef4425abff68da27b05bd524978de","3f0b127c2388c1611c3a9e55d1074608ab1ee165","61ff6a855764b413783618ff518bb040f6438f75","e41a7db54e9eecced2423799313e581208fd7158","0d0b70133649b27178dd04b79eb7669745b23dcb","abe079ed1d9ed8e0d6669668195c4f80818c7c71","f727d2276d26f2a7f29989436fb07a1512ae1738","a5c103980267080a74153ae51ce1fc64c09acac7","16ef9563ccab88d4fe388fe638a8efa76869b988","f27cfe5e7bcb9cccf71ed9132bd9894276c2315d","2e9308e3b86250c6b9a257b6bb3811a8efa3d57b","19d90b26fff98897369b35a67021244c82cc83c1","112a0185cffd64ffa4a4f4951ee47cc9bb56ca2d","e353367b4b4210868adefae3c0de0fc02f3327d6","90252c9a77f4f5a39a3620388fdbcd071aef814a","4fb711caa625a3a7860208b3cc10a68eee25d851","959222c0a3b2b96c8942d5851c5c21fae336618c","439557a6ea6b5cef11a4e70944c1f6cbbf3e70cb","df66b9fce913b05b3858b00b5235d52c6a5a33b1","a59ae0db2160226478fcbb39b2d2044f6800bbfd","27a8be5afd720c645033939d741c9fb6498fd7ea","c9d50f36ccd90db16a649d8fefc0b0c2c648348c","d05cf45ea80a12af26a4d06307c415b818d3df55","acefef85f53b14452ba088f8ad5467ee609b1f5e","7bacfdc8d80d1de7d8d7e134261c7240db8a69f1","d1159623edfb3599d14f0602605df2f1f6cd2c69","9a0760eee0177655b7330d2fbb3d50f54d947aef","261109bb00a4e97865118c30c8e9a33bd47dc283","0138b38950834c1f34d0b78b99568aaa90419b1f","933e53d3d311ce0271de2f449f7a0bb8ae8ea8fe","b840c0ed7a6116afbe2f5113df4b67b641117166","6423742c180ed33a3a98e2f3cfeac14096007f0f","297fd2ee96c04b3d9578b6ccb4e85eb30db630c2","62b98f033d55f09f63acfb010f92ae30f19d4af6","9d5e734eaaeb9446ebaf813b16e844c7e676945e","fad9d77460da5d02a58832ac5e4e64963465ef63","7191ad7625acb37e9a71402efbe475cb51390dd7","cae1907302ae27a4e6077b938736caa7e40f711f","00758a1d2ece3932ff146b1c323d2ce30da91495","fe048a81cb10343bf49b08e38a8458f7e41e3415","843f4694779d7e4e28157986d08aa1c962ad9590","73e5634ec60bc511ea0edcb18d9a6b8099050713","12c7d664b45fc3c6ac3b13990e32a6c36e4f136a","c24e3a08b4ba53bf1df06d75f8ff2c782b769158","4d0c6a70de15860a56652ec758da4558402216bf","ed7348089e29dcd529b93e31f596cd9834841ab2","977e35bf526689e692d03a4cff980f65db2f3e44","059b90f1e8327283095732612e3438e041dc2e5a","3bfb4c5d02bc3a94ae1d3e9c24269482a30c09d0","20e244cbc34764892f67135d43de12d534eb5357","a19563f96374f060801717fa4667155cd0e42783","4e9ca165d1c4e3e3ee76b51752e80b3b03b942a2","3714eab8f4bdb7e68d22a10bca549d44e72a4fba","f2e13e765ecbee01ad8aa97483968280753d779b","6634bfe07a09b8a09257c9625a959c8490a30231","241871a56e119b9d03794a66d9870f71d5b5f034","d06bab956640efe57e3c0c6d550c8a77c7690e23","b61045b8e1b725f4a2f7c2d38f242b770a681a79","b8d2cf22619de09e18c9272d67beb143b3a36676","1b9f9f9f8cebe983f4565e80abea8825af8e6233","54d243e4e24adcb37525b568f9f64a5c2d5d6986"],"title":"A Bayesian forecasting model: predicting U.S. male mortality.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj024"}
