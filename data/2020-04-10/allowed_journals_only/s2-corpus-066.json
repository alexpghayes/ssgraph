As a result, statistical models to estimate critical windows of susceptibility have been developed for several different reproductive outcomes and pollutants. However, these current methods fail to adequately address the primary objective of this line of research; how to statistically identify a critical window of susceptibility. In this article, we introduce critical window variable selection (CWVS), a hierarchical Bayesian framework that directly addresses this question while simultaneously providing improved estimation of the risk parameters. Through simulation, we show that CWVS outperforms existing competing techniques in the setting of highly temporally correlated exposures in terms of (i) correctly identifying critical windows and (ii) accurately estimating risk parameters. We apply all competing methods to a case/control analysis of pregnant women in North Carolina, 2005-2008, with respect to the development of very preterm birth and exposure to ambient ozone and particulate matter $<$ 2.5 $\\mu$m in aerodynamic diameter, and identify/estimate the critical windows of susceptibility. The newly developed method is implemented in the R package CWVS.","inCitations":["1593be27493d3483eab92cd8c3ddb836b8ee7a7d","e5d06791cf9857f44eece2bd58ae1cfffcb5b3d0"],"title":"Critical window variable selection: estimating the impact of air pollution on very preterm birth.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz006"}

Study participants who became HIV infected were followed for 2 years and monitored for HIV viral load and initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In order to determine if vaccination may have altered HIV progression in persons who acquired HIV, a pre-specified objective was to compare the time until a composite endpoint between the vaccine and placebo arms, where the composite endpoint is the first event of ART initiation or viral failure (HIV viral load exceeds a threshold x(vl) copies/ml). Specifically, with vaccine efficacy, VE(tau, x(vl)), defined as one minus the ratio (vaccine/placebo) of the cumulative probability of the composite endpoint (with failure threshold x(vl)) occurring by tau months, the aim was to estimate the four parameters {VE(tau, x(vl)): x(vl) is an element of {1500, 10,000, 20,000, 55,000} copies/ml} with simultaneous 95% confidence bands. A Gaussian multipliers simulation method is devised for constructing confidence bands for VE(tau, x(vl)) with x(vl) spanning multiple discrete values or a continuous range. The new method is evaluated in simulations and is applied to the vaccine trial data set.","inCitations":["bf3958a824941bb766351d5f18cfd6ec205958fe","a657c50dcfa1d89cf3e3fa543592e6d563c4fa34","2641f1243ddf6efd07402368b7f2024284bcf490","19c388501db837b6cd3805d0ab0a21f68cbe909f"],"title":"Failure time analysis of HIV vaccine effects on viral load and antiretroviral therapy initiation.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi014"}

The aim of this paper is to propose a penalized multi-scale adaptive regression model (PMARM) framework to spatially and adaptively infer the orientation distribution function (ODF) of water diffusion in regions with complex fiber configurations. In PMARM, we reformulate the HARDI imaging reconstruction as a weighted regularized least-squares regression (WRLSR) problem. Similarity and distance weights are introduced to account for spatial smoothness of HARDI, while preserving the unknown discontinuities (e.g., edges between white matter and grey matter) of HARDI. The L1 penalty function is introduced to ensure the sparse solutions of ODFs, while a scaled L1 weighted estimator is calculated to correct the bias introduced by the L1 penalty at each voxel. In PMARM, we integrate the multiscale adaptive regression models (Li et al., 2011), the propagation-separation method (Polzehl and Spokoiny, 2000), and Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) (Tibshirani, 1996) to adaptively estimate ODFs across voxels. Experimental results indicate that PMARM can reduce the angle detection errors on fiber crossing area and provide more accurate reconstruction than standard voxel-wise methods.","inCitations":["2baa53b05ed75a2b20f0f474b9e821877b6101ce","d5174d36d3f2f29eaf100e87a039fcbacfea444d","87fee188cbe848814edeaeb9a4b31438bd9ad51f"],"title":"SR-HARDI: Spatially Regularizing High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2015.1105750"}

Such boundaries imply stopping resampling after relatively few replications if the early replications indicate a very large or very small p-value. We study a truncated sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) boundary and provide a tractable algorithm to implement it. We review two properties desired of any MC p-value, the validity of the p-value and a small resampling risk, where resampling risk is the probability that the accept/reject decision will be different than the decision from complete enumeration. We show how the algorithm can be used to calculate a valid p-value and confidence intervals for any truncated SPRT boundary. We show that a class of SPRT boundaries is minimax with respect to resampling risk and recommend a truncated version of boundaries in that class by comparing their resampling risk (RR) to the RR of fixed boundaries with the same maximum resample size. We study the lack of validity of some simple estimators of p-values and offer a new simple valid p-value for the recommended truncated SPRT boundary. We explore the use of these methods in a practical example and provide the MChtest R package to perform the methods.","inCitations":["68d74b70efc0b29d9d797ee602e7ad875aad0ef1","b83f5a37f48b9771d0593772bdd164ef7c5d0a28","d80925488ef0b782d0d36ed13e59e1e3cb3e12f7","6734ed75bb6007565708e966ad14da5721172dfd","4096fb2845949152d4ac568fe275d730e46866c1","be1cde683fff4ebe003c1d6384d5b2514186b4b6","0d32e309fb0cf206395794fee379039e353bdcad","631042c45ead2e92d68ba8a3d21883d962ba4875","7ebdc147c7b45d1749aeb38cdd9f939b02441dba","279930f6bdec139a9eaf9f17450494039e5d8898","7e7040ee2f78969fcf682faebc3393456f2682c7","4fd1f9b10b74b4291f8062dd437411c8e32febd5","3f652685be6c45fb9be76b994647f7b07654df05","b5fd29f35a2f2eb716603552cb8ae732cf459fb5","d989e7cab59e98b394edafab8787e58d1a4bd251","f795b32f00f2174506642b4d5bbcc2ab4bfae820","e8542266d7f8d8657dd9548aa2fd3f019fe0f303","bb5f2d60731ab730031eb3c2d5c2be907a66a618"],"title":"On Using Truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test Boundaries for Monte Carlo Implementation of Hypothesis Tests.","doi":"10.1198/106186007X257025"}

At the phase III stage, one of the major uses of POPPK is to identify covariate influences on human pharmacokinetics, which is important for potential dose adjustment and drug labeling. One common analysis approach is nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, which typically involves time-consuming extensive search for best fits among a large number of possible models. We propose that the analysis goal can be better achieved with a more standard confirmatory statistical analysis approach, which uses a prespecified primary analysis and additional sensitivity analyses. We illustrate this approach using a phase III study data set and compare the result with that calculated using the common exploratory approach. We argue that the confirmatory approach not only substantially reduces analysis time but also yields more accurate and interpretable results. Some aspects of this confirmatory approach may also be extended to data analysis in earlier stages of clinical drug development, i.e. phase II and phase I.","inCitations":["ec1660a36d0748fd1a576e39255cc837cd1775d3","6535331484f202e71d9ca241743b9d3a746351d3","52768458ab9f3bb820e1fb43504505b629394934","41228e714737a71a6e540ea27e5d355fc51d00a2","18270328c17b349169a11dd6cf3823bde5d15c46","f464926757db64972a4732795b7cbbf39a8c7b4d","f24b270516a7caab4c4602687ff851f3c908e64e","a5b545cdfe998f55a3cc9157acd0f9ac03ad3f73","b7f2e8699438807670cdd204fff573d458a842d2","3259b7e3bae1b8c0eb959d827e912021ee5e5655","6a13b3a19ff87a8e03cd2a9e2e6b4fc4f1cdd598","e11d3fd864f73ba749bcba1a2a4341f16fcfa8a2","078fbac06eee6eb7e26cf573329719821126ef53","24410af8557ae53e785a38b020fb2514d19ff34e","d9257165672b0832df1261d3b2df32ed2e406479","960e2a2f24f9e5c5331064ab1640a785477483de","c3bb56834a88ca2dccf92b0b87f4d24c86dcb366","1853a4c4f37679a0be7bd82c3be1c241fd7967ac","7c5220d32b3670b51763066a94765a79d8e91b37","110d6e81bfa3ffc49b49147d15e4ffeefa898d9d","b69f27b69bfc4507901920dd45ba0250e046dfd6","3bb27358c2fbda33c245a926193cf0b6d1bf7acf","288966eb15a720fd57f4600a5717d4faa0d9ac3d"],"title":"Confirmatory analysis for phase III population pharmacokinetics.","doi":"10.1002/pst.403"}

Using repeated measurements of the length of the entire cycle and of the preovular phase provided by a large English database, we describe a Bayesian hierarchical dynamic approach to the problem. A state-space process is used to model the temporal behavior of the series of lengths for each woman. The individual processes are then embedded into a multivariate system through a Bayesian hierarchy in which model parameters are allowed to vary across subjects according to a specified probability distribution. The most interesting features of the suggested method are (a) it takes into account explicitly the temporal nature of the available data and (b) if combined with a fecundability model, it can be used to forecast the probability of conception in future cycles as a function of any intercourse behavior.","inCitations":["78f405fc543d6746f409efc8c5e55b4bb4d3d3c1","3a49a9e0fa1733d25587abeff1e10cdb43457020","a9de76fdd0e31a3116965fd5f83e14aa1840f99a","f2f91bf5b65c40696adcb707768c5e97deba7472","73da34247e9b57e6729943aba861e7c022d9c9c6"],"title":"Sequential predictions of menstrual cycle lengths.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq020"}

In this case, a popular design approach is to specify the response rate and the prevalence of each subgroup, to calculate the response rate of the whole population by the weighted average of the response rates across subgroups, and to choose a standard Phase II design such as Simon's optimal or minimax design to test the response rate for the whole population. In this case, although the prevalence of each subgroup is accurately specified, the observed prevalence among the accrued patients to the study may be quite different from the expected one because of the small sample size, which is typical in most Phase II trials. The fixed rejection value for a chosen standard Phase II design may be either too conservative (i.e., increasing the false rejection probability of the experimental therapy) if the trial accrues more high-risk patients than expected, or too anti-conservative (i.e., increasing the false acceptance probability of the experimental therapy) if the trial accrues more low-risk patients than expected. We can avoid such problems by adjusting the rejection values, depending on the observed prevalence from the trial. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the flexible designs compared with the standard design with fixed rejection values under various settings.","inCitations":["adcf7cacd7eaec7443b36118918f5b50196a6488","e66b46e95d2281d2022ccbb92fec2d6dbf0e896f"],"title":"Phase II cancer clinical trials with heterogeneous patient populations.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.536873"}

imposed.","inCitations":["b7cc143b190e47eb67f82a0e8ab5501bf7c169a3","9d8cc348f5a97fc2278479904fe6e1b90b7f7302","de458983ac5215307b54e056cabc5cea234e3060","c2e41a8f45ee7330dd5e3de98149c54246a9a7dd","dd0dcf9c608f1fe52eb784ececada4e7e435110b","6eb37352a132d42da238bac49a82216bbf0f718e","cda33d84dc4b67b312e3ed683bbe794ffddd2f3d","b3604518abf97b295d5606180cc1727ef348b222","5e970e190d394227421b1a578b19556e10c07a02","cd1f716d875be9316d9d24abe0e8f6c5965ec28d","81aa478aaf9bbc0ede6a1612632c24d502b2a17d","de1917505226abcbb7bbfe18a7ed29e77163c25b","7a7e4a5d91c613480bd2aafba1a7ab78badda0fd","e60b938d4644275a78a183343d9c400bd1fddf0e","ca233f649a0079924aff2c9fdc505a2dd794933f","51f753bde97feae700f52a2c42e683950d21c673","3632d180240798542491effa835f4f807a08ec95","95c979327e0a20dbf1626f020fd6809a6b48feef","6cb0880e2dff11d7fb3d2c73e0072920b61ca5f4","b81e53f4ca62c9e2b961166544c9f6043aa7db18","bc0e29183c112f1babefb121873e18f602acb565","a589a50804124ffa3427b48d53993e0e11a5b1a1","2c64712f7394bb6cd89d3d4c3aad70bb38fcb86c","d42a5fd1079c295b4b54f1205645929eb5e4cf59","fa3230d631bfb2d22f7da81e36d527358c0268bc","181f925679b4629547cd9ae0b99d69cd433bb143","0d5c9381bc41a3aec7e606b9a2a6700f8845f8ac","644ff485067eddaaf6c3e6418bcd72fc4c0b64c8","9e1f0bd0f3b1be43a2988a86c5ebef0e3b7f5f2a","0509b2b73cc01055a8cad37708c0c3c8ce43ec4e","b3701b15f91bcb665c7fbfe78a9cd3b76387120a","3fc7b0be6848da79e83320e28b9ce7d8973c2d83","c526be79fab60890543c4a4d3001bde40a61491d","9700354bb72d220c35d36c3a8ba08a4b4293caf1","5c0c28a1a692b83541d1615ad71cd211b72ada57","2f48ef3a8e271b2b803f6e9b405feade31908b72","fe6ce19cf3c808d3d993a0b6474b11ce2dc641bf","c99bded7993b26f2d04eaaf86a206ade9a109aa6","97c550c667bb9d913b5d160cabccea1eb8913d21","69b6fec81af07899bdf5e67ea5a744715210cdce","b71d9f4e3298e7a8614f50aa3524770e38fc6b9f","a566f41ca7ff01cd03820a7a5a26ff846d763ebe","7c5b4c8d03bc95ac914b9e125b73df160043c3a9","bee020fa851acc260777dee5699ac1424d0ce543","5206461b87131e851f21eca0243a480d98a34185","4e9fa3018b87c272f9d5aba1b0440399da85ffa9","4f6590583fcb67e8e35680690e2f90283e91f5da","ba517866f06f188ced59b55de6f9f02fd9e9611c","65fba333ca07069b57a3cd07454446c239333581","0152c3c1d474288cfbc21f1d86b9b9459c912b2b","4a7a83cb9d265762cce102589e629ad3bffe56bc","a7700ce2dd1ddaef16b46e71ad465fdb6b67d8bf","1103e784294b80c4405f89283f3f2e2aa9c118f0","dd773eb15a16c90ab81325a8e5a2efb4524b4635","255f97aed17d99f509521c129fe974157452f655","ee1d0b525431477d7954e28c68dc0c5fbbc16f67","564b414598668dc275b819504dee146d3f5dbe47","c1fbf032cbb514d5e217590ed078c150232464e3","17a97a46ae78d674b093f0cb6b1404eda4638f7f","b251ce6d39313d112d1a2ea2bb5b630162a27689","502d2021172009794c5398b88e4631688262af6f","d90e00713737977cdd8731e5223af53dcded8c32","91b9fa1580e481cc4385592b204f431ac2229529","1b7eca6230f7e5d45069dddc2dbc0e9093592126","911e87a4b425815815090cebb6394c9d49460235","d1e139d004fff15dac8afa6cb18d81048e4627e4","3acbfef7db60eff62967038ff9adafe5faf8c91c","42d57b443210bf4e494b39465c543a388bb5e353","30a4a3bee56c1e46ad91f62325ac530059bb5adf","6791b01f3a0a2bdf0c70e478e3ffc18fc5ca9ed3","8f3e5552b668bd54599cc41fcbfe8f0f59133664","96e504168c54d50e3ec2e17cdee4672bd8d9ab07","58203fffb9fbf7c9a26451ba90e853d1d0c69b7a","7d293e3e78cb8cc9cd071ba26dc8fa6f0adb8d88","6574ace0d64a6cbbc4e2857abf5b88746e953d24","ee72d819f5f377542637f3b656dad374fccba979","f97cc270b5f6c87569b3d985d0f8595049362e3f","5480e3e62828409292a3d2fb1eafa7d2fc1b68b8","a01cd51416397d488d7f1a45816750dbb20894fb","51ceafa6ab55e9e60a6a6a4830ca8546db11997f","c0034bf5bd335153b58e4b9dc4b9696979b8c7cd","00aba7993a787174e437c8c259a05be0c60378ce","992b95ce2a8895715cde62526406abdef625d250","91e511dfcde0cc2ed0a9741541aa8d310f754249","0a9baa2821eb8cae98ab26ca529ae15bbfb848c0","e4d8647f56e722cbe4d6703ad7135548b245c5e7","6ffed09b24ffdde8f4ed022d934c8a357dd1ce36","834b586d1c6229a24757a206a8f16b3544099743","99cb23533a90870df18e33bb73d9fc4eae7d09c0","6f39e1124fe47bea99cac16b3d583886c6c81b13","14c8b19036f49a1dd3ab63dac63280955cdb0e86","875aa399563b7012611ecbae3ff26cd90a40a2d4","1bce69e10671206383afda4c899c0fb76e914377","95e21779bda4305c2ab2c4c676a4a0dd97352eb0","3742036654d852c49f9900f4132c020dba72c6c0","aeddaea17af6db28d76e5b91ec670ce163bb4aab","049a69c6dd4916f766ee3cf156718f1cccd812a6","ac47a7f65080992ef1c7b0697fe187697f2ea31e","bd8b9564cbbe359d4840ce624c0192db073b3147","8baf103a4e82c36bc3fa5468d75190987b0d8baa","1583dfa6296d6c7e7203f221479d185889b3f3d5","1294411f856518f074af252a32c98a2d7533a685","6898494ba1cdba3e87c505e7fb40d10cceed0c7f","f56803cc630fe6ff570d469c273932666efe1463","847e827ada9146ef16b168f8c37d484b70d887c2","8998f3e6dcd31b6fb7d2b962f03fde57894ed745","262f1ed82225060a25154b960bc6aa95ef30a167","3705fa65eaeecc4cb0275456b9c822a4c9272d36","2cb1158b07fd06ab3e42372fed24544b8b42df50","8e47fc79542b35140469d2f1991e9b5b6d9d78cf","49dc84a832699011750b166cc90ba43c2a176d63","5ae2549ccc4e786941b3c917d73fa1429942b8fa","fb58cd4632776aa7ba817f07cb0cace55175f885","ce97a73c79831b65da2d80a1d5d7aef5d631db12","348bfad2234cd6c0824fdcb3123cca7949573d7b","150c4137220c61852873d06c960f5

We study a stylized version of this trial with the goal to determine optimal actions in each of two cycles of therapy. A design is presented that generalizes the decision-theoretic two-cycle design of Lee and others (2015. Bayesian dose-finding in two treatment cycles based on the joint utility of efficacy and toxicity. Journal of the American Statistical Association, to appear) to accommodate ordinal outcomes. Backward induction is used to jointly optimize the actions taken for each patient in each of the two cycles, with the second action accounting for the patient's cycle 1 dose and outcomes. A simulation study shows that simpler designs obtained by dichotomizing the ordinal outcomes either perform very similarly to the proposed design, or have much worse performance in some scenarios. We also compare the proposed design with the simpler approaches of optimizing the doses in each cycle separately, or ignoring the distinction between cycles 1 and 2.","inCitations":["2454ce348d41d325cfbc17fb2491187647056523","cec5876727b8ce7f949d7dcbbc519e964b0dc3d9","32056bcab22c6f5cb6cbe852ea4f5cdf6ad7af45","1ba6db3f4d87cf1f80801578c64faa6fb760c6b9"],"title":"A decision-theoretic phase I-II design for ordinal outcomes in two cycles.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv045"}

In the first part of the paper we exhibit some structural properties of the skill-problem relationship and consequences for the interpretation of concurrent theories in terms of the skill theory. The second part of the paper offers a test theory based on skill functions: we present measurements for the data consistency of the skill-problem relationship, and estimate abilities in terms of lower and/or upper boundaries of problem states and skills, given a special instance of the skill-problem relationship. Some practical considerations are discussed, which enable the user of a skill-based system to optimize a partial theory about the skill-based behaviour of subjects based on empirical results.","inCitations":["68133614509523764e33a15b349817f405408b7a","d0cad723f635279348f0f38070a5214c73cddbe8","6a7074a0ddb717103e09845d85413ac645075d33","406519fa24be007fc734e3ad52989575211a8f30","6256d1b15d2d91154d93ebe83a77f1d2899c36d3","4db7a2f717d639de384ea9393b82d58d2819194a","8d5805edb09b4af3f59e4f56aa45d27c7ceffe35","b67410835afd741d187edcc2b22a9cfc387df9cd","72d9a3ccaaa319c9cf5b5741134c1c6c7940533c"],"title":"Skill set analysis in knowledge structures.","doi":"10.1348/000711002760554516"}

It is well known that most models are just an approximation to the true data generating process but among such model approximations it is our goal to select the \"best\" one. Researchers typically consider a finite number of plausible models in statistical applications and the related statistical inference depends on the chosen model. Hence model comparison is required to identify the \"best\" model among several such candidate models. This article considers the problem of model selection for spatial data. The issue of model selection for spatial models has been addressed in the literature by the use of traditional information criteria based methods, even though such criteria have been developed based on the assumption of independent observations. We evaluate the performance of some of the popular model selection critera via Monte Carlo simulation experiments using small to moderate samples. In particular, we compare the performance of some of the most popular information criteria such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Corrected AIC (AICc) in selecting the true model. The ability of these criteria to select the correct model is evaluated under several scenarios. This comparison is made using various spatial covariance models ranging from stationary isotropic to nonstationary models.","inCitations":["78ac0278b5cd68fdb582e29bba24f6cf777e56b2","68ce834ca42ac517cef62c4902c683deeb2c1ed3","03a4c77f0f68a934aade2c68918ad0558baee3d0","f6296d527bebfc62fcd0cd90f131bab9685c3940","b8200d531cf901ac79cdd8d2fd5e8e177b5b197e","a3b0f18b312a2b1ac1117b48344e9b1b7ed041eb","b3f1d4501c650536ab14fa42a50c9a1917bd7e67","b0a0bc781f994af9d4a7684f53232917d805549e","257f97a5adb8dc2660a60f999064c2a592c7368f","5460eabd6725135c8d77d3f973168bf68e879fb5","fb1ad6fd8b75eb9fd55f2d4d69f2fae7db8e1463","d6d4d2dd6113dbe63300860bc5c15aa7f4d202eb","09930bca9ff8f3436dea31cdd3fac0717061ea8c","e8632a9e423342ef2e6924c2bf83c136b4c97806","09ccf74e3c2caa3c95f9652765b99a3e27fb12b9","5b678dc1b5b688ac4eaf4096f14f3a17c3e90385","43cf6549dde05a03d832306acaf42c57d618c6ad","14371386bcec7e972133cbdc11e79590529ce020","e67a3479cd3f9daff151ffb666fad9a15f5587ea"],"title":"Performance of Information Criteria for Spatial Models.","doi":"10.1080/00949650701611143"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2019,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The annals of applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Most causal inference studies rely on the assumption of overlap to estimate population or sample average causal effects. When data suffer from non-overlap, estimation of these estimands requires reliance on model specifications, due to poor data support. All existing methods to address non-overlap, such as trimming or down-weighting data in regions of poor data support, change the estimand so that inference cannot be made on the sample or the underlying population. In environmental health research settings, where study results are often intended to influence policy, population-level inference may be critical, and changes in the estimand can diminish the impact of the study results, because estimates may not be representative of effects in the population of interest to policymakers. Researchers may be willing to make additional, minimal modeling assumptions in order to preserve the ability to estimate population average causal effects. We seek to make two contributions on this topic. First, we propose a flexible, data-driven definition of propensity score overlap and non-overlap regions. Second, we develop a novel Bayesian framework to estimate population average causal effects with minor model dependence and appropriately large uncertainties in the presence of non-overlap and causal effect heterogeneity. In this approach, the tasks of estimating causal effects in the overlap and non-overlap regions are delegated to two distinct models, suited to the degree of data support in each region. Tree ensembles are used to non-parametrically estimate individual causal effects in the overlap region, where the data can speak for themselves. In the non-overlap region, where insufficient data support means reliance on model specification is necessary, individual causal effects are estimated by extrapolating trends from the overlap region via a spline model. The promising performance of our method is demonstrated in simulations. Finally, we utilize our method to perform a novel investigation of the causal effect of natural gas compressor station exposure on cancer outcomes. Code and data to implement the method and reproduce all simulations and analyses is available on Github (https://github.com/rachelnethery/overlap).","inCitations":["bd9ebd189ee07cdf2430ec8b813fef1174efaedc","2492c5a2c571568f0c5fe8572c00dc6445d7ddce"],"title":"Estimating Population Average Causal Effects in the Presence of Non-overlap: the Effect of Natural Gas Compressor Station Exposure on Cancer Mortality.","doi":"10.1214/18-AOAS1231"}

The ordinary unweighted average method outperforms all statistical methods by consistently giving the best coverage probability but with somewhat wider confidence intervals. The weighted average methods give good coverage and smaller confidence intervals when combining homogeneous bioactivities. For heterogeneous bioactivities, these methods work well when a liberal significance level for testing homogeneity of bioactivities is used.

However, it is often a dilemma to decide which model to use when conducting a particular drug-combination trial. We make a comprehensive comparison of four dose-finding methods, and for fairness, we apply the same dose-finding algorithm under the four model structures. Through extensive simulation studies, we compare the operating characteristics of these methods in various practical scenarios. The results show that different models may lead to different design properties and that no single model performs uniformly better in all scenarios. As a result, we propose using Bayesian model averaging to overcome the arbitrariness of the model specification and enhance the robustness of the design. We assign a discrete probability mass to each model as the prior model probability and then estimate the toxicity probabilities of combined doses in the Bayesian model averaging framework. During the trial, we adaptively allocated each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose combination by comparing the posterior estimates of the toxicity probabilities with the prespecified toxicity target. The simulation results demonstrate that the Bayesian model averaging approach is robust under various scenarios.","inCitations":["b44ca1d8c3ffb37ad65c2f80b2bbfa8c15876e46","cb7c1786c47f7e23db3c2bb1c7fb783d39c1dd92","1fae07c3f204201511b79d77c66cf63763b7909f"],"title":"Phase I trial design for drug combinations with Bayesian model averaging.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1668"}
