Thus, before comparing parameter estimates across forms, a linear transformation must be applied to at least one form's scale. The mean-sigma method is a well-known procedure for estimating this adjustment when a common set of items appears on both forms. In this paper, I show both analytically and empirically (through a small simulation study) that the mean-sigma estimators of the transformation constants are biased. While this systematic error was modest relative to random error under the conditions studied here, it is nevertheless intrinsic and its magnitude is conditional on extrinsic design features that include the number of anchor items and the quality of their difficulty estimates.","inCitations":["da9423829c3333769b24fa32eec647f00317a0cf"],"title":"On mean-sigma estimators and bias.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02048.x"}

The targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) methodology is more robust than the methods typically implemented and allows practitioners to estimate parameters that directly answer the question of interest. TMLE will be used in this paper to estimate two newly proposed parameters of interest that quantify effect modification in the time to event setting. These methods are then applied to the Tshepo study to assess if either gender or baseline CD4 level modify the effect of two cART therapies of interest, efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP), on the progression of HIV. The results show that women tend to have more favorable outcomes using EFV while males tend to have more favorable outcomes with NVP.

A major contributor to this divergence is the feature characteristic of microarray data sets that the number of predictors (genes) in such data far exceeds the number of samples by many orders of magnitude, with only a small percentage of predictors being truly informative with regards to the clustering while the rest merely add noise. An additional complication is that the predictors exhibit an unknown complex correlational configuration embedded in a small subspace of the entire predictor space. Under these conditions, standard clustering algorithms fail to find the true clusters even when applied in tandem with some sort of gene filtering or dimension reduction to reduce the number of predictors. We propose, as an alternative, a novel method for unsupervised classification of DNA microarray data. The method, which is based on the idea of aggregating results obtained from an ensemble of randomly resampled data (where both samples and genes are resampled), introduces a way of tilting the procedure so that the ensemble includes minimal representation from less important areas of the gene predictor space. The method produces a measure of dissimilarity between each pair of samples that can be used in conjunction with (a) a method like Ward's procedure to generate a cluster analysis and (b) multidimensional scaling to generate useful visualizations of the data. We call the dissimilarity measures ABC dissimilarities since they are obtained by aggregating bundles of clusters. An extensive comparison of several clustering methods using actual DNA microarray data convincingly demonstrates that classification using ABC dissimilarities offers significantly superior performance.","inCitations":["78a8a622d4c0b3d88af541c456932d7b27237c14","58bd44c4272befb7524f7236a455d03915f74b0e","c5d390877c9ec3522c63af3b2d78809a14d1596f","4b4a39eda94cd48f94c02cf37940783fdce16747","514c25cfe10664854b4f12e73b19599674034463","543ce1feeace1a0e99d680ad2bddc04228e3c6cd","4417afe6c5dbc2efa11fefcaaaea39f9e9661079"],"title":"Microarray learning with ABC.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm017"}

The Bonferroni adjustment is one of the most widely used approaches, yet it suffers from poor statistical performance when there are correlated test statistics. For example, it is criticized to be too conservative. Nonetheless, part of the strong appeal of the Bonferroni approach is the straightforward implementation and relatively intuitive explanation. In this manuscript, a novel adaptation to the traditional Bonferroni approach that accounts for correlated data is proposed. A simple correction factor based on intraclass correlation is applied to the standard Bonferroni method to overcome the shortcomings of the standard Bonferroni adjustment yet maintains its advantages. The method is motivated by an early phase clinical trial examining the effect of a study medication on marijuana craving, which is commonly quantified into four correlated constructs. A detailed simulation study demonstrated that the proposed approach is statistically sound and appropriate for a wide range of common settings.","inCitations":["49ca9263aed9e892b4075c874909f19e1e0f4e94","2275c4d6c3677fc3d7ff391c09a5838537f98ee9","96b0926db6ec2c917be67959f984378f91ca60fe","332525696b26604eb5f43cf4a5e935254877197b","df04c03f4cebe72c7e928d95d75a706e1422cf11","bd24054204bbcf3d14c5ae9d2dcf83f9f67a5d0c","40c0f51edf7113f8c469a17087bd98bbfe48e070","47ef29902281f29a066cde948bd6298086a024d6","4aae056a6d6d4daa9c80033173b7616968b07ad2","3c4b644e7f34a829a23612aee689fe4fd118b998","c2e320586c483e4347cf23b82a3725396a321965","fae2b91d0a26f056832f1799f7b57e6f02e666ba","b949bb766fa23f84d67bfd4c6d0abfa4c467a166","729816adce00d3589025c2d7d2e6fb8f73e36d4a","d480604ff412f88d0beb45ae48fcf3b977d3d2cd","922e18023754da2e71bed9c1a3bbaa2677285205","75f8b1020362b5f8f2b83467b892fd52e52f3f4f","f80985ca736dc49ed9d92351e428c04ccaab7abc","a41465215a227b04414bebc7f2d314fc090ada2c","59696363b868a6ec83d753ca15e1aff17a820460","27855e8a5aa3e736e1951826d556e21202b638ba","b62583ba40bd20897f29b1a6833b915f6e49f025","71bc93afdf7d237ce0c8cb8fc2f2a755c59c0328","dafc02602eb1691cc163a19503c945023362fdc9","449958a4e837219382b06a73b476f130be3ab870","914a73ebdfd32f10a784017af3757f4c15600243","c4509c08ed93164fc038a7c4b15a4d3f99f618cb","4baa45e776610270ed27420ff3a10496eaf9b2ad","ae9749c356d504e490dbb31afdffd174d745e637","d7c2503dd9dc0b1caff79aef36669f5ff0edbf32","924213c2b24e981dfe11a21c8d67c7cf1dca54bf"],"title":"Bonferroni-based correction factor for multiple, correlated endpoints.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1514"}

The guidelines, however, do not offer advice on the size or type of outlier that should be removed prior to model fitting and calculation of RP. Computer simulation was used to investigate the consequences of ignoring the USP<1032> guidance to remove outliers. For biotherapeutics and vaccines, outliers in potency data may result in the false acceptance/rejection of a bad/good lot of drug product. Biological activity, measured through a potency bioassay, is considered a critical quality attribute in manufacturing. If the concentration-response potency curve of a test sample is deemed to be similar in shape to that of the reference standard, the curves are said to exhibit constant RP, an essential criterion for the interpretation of a RP. One or more outliers in the concentration-response data, however, may result in a failure to declare similarity or may yield a biased RP estimate. Concentration-response curves for test and reference were computer generated with constant RP from four-parameter logistic curves. Single outlier, multiple outlier, and whole-curve outlier scenarios were explored for their effects on the similarity testing and on the RP estimation. Though the simulations point to situations for which outlier removal is unnecessary, the results generally support the USP<1032> recommendation and illustrate the impact on the RP calculation when application of outlier removal procedures are discounted.","inCitations":["e9eb858278e7d6c23e45c781a9b053172b570e46"],"title":"Effect of a statistical outlier in potency bioassays.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1893"}

These questions of bias become important to the extent investigators focus on the magnitude of the observed effects. As an example, such bias can lead to problems in attempting to validate results, if a biased effect size is used to power a follow-up study. An associated important consequence is that confidence intervals constructed using standard distributions may be badly biased. A bootstrap approach is used to estimate and adjust for the bias in the effect sizes of those variables showing strongest differences. This bias is not always present; some principles showing what factors may lead to greater bias are given and a proof of the convergence of the bootstrap distribution is provided.","inCitations":["05cc1e85897f53258ea19163dabd84933b190401","0174082ff35d5c2a38abfbc2d5c757d92d09302e","4955fe88942dbd3ea49e4f5164ae93bb7e8724fb","886606f81ed8ec672dc6bf1b20245aa555b5b8bc","7dad228cb8fff5739f29b0ef392938fc6fdb0b2c","852d7acb2eaff7be98fe5d6a2989f4bf02983a29","9bb3701fcc7d342665f19a0d08cf57ccb8ddd956"],"title":"Multiple comparisons distortions of parameter estimates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl025"}

RNA-seq data offer insight into gene expression levels and transcriptome structures, enabling us to better understand the regulation of gene expression and fundamental biological processes. Accurate isoform quantification from RNA-seq data is challenging due to the information loss in sequencing experiments. A recent accumulation of multiple RNA-seq data sets from the same tissue or cell type provides new opportunities to improve the accuracy of isoform quantification. However, existing statistical or computational methods for multiple RNA-seq samples either pool the samples into one sample or assign equal weights to the samples when estimating isoform abundance. These methods ignore the possible heterogeneity in the quality of different samples and could result in biased and unrobust estimates. In this article, we develop a method, which we call \"joint modeling of multiple RNA-seq samples for accurate isoform quantification\" (MSIQ), for more accurate and robust isoform quantification by integrating multiple RNA-seq samples under a Bayesian framework. Our method aims to (1) identify a consistent group of samples with homogeneous quality and (2) improve isoform quantification accuracy by jointly modeling multiple RNA-seq samples by allowing for higher weights on the consistent group. We show that MSIQ provides a consistent estimator of isoform abundance, and we demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of MSIQ compared with alternative methods through simulation studies on D. melanogaster genes. We justify MSIQ's advantages over existing approaches via application studies on real RNA-seq data from human embryonic stem cells, brain tissues, and the HepG2 immortalized cell line. We also perform a comprehensive analysis of how the isoform quantification accuracy would be affected by RNA-seq sample heterogeneity and different experimental protocols.","inCitations":["b4ed062f58cce35b4fc5853bbca1fadf0324c156","2ebf9f4e4b61cd8316bd1fcb4f5265b3459a43d2","02fec258046e95dccd91968833780f1c9e48eccf"],"title":"Msiq: Joint Modeling of Multiple Rna-seq Samples for Accurate Isoform Quantification.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1100"}

In the context of discrete time survival analysis for infectious disease data, we develop self-consistent algorithms to obtain unbiased estimates of the time to first event when the sensitivity and/or specificity of the diagnostic test for the outcome is less than 100%. Two examples are presented.

The present study extends the findings of previous studies and provides further reasons for discontinuing the use of preliminary tests. The study found Type I error rates of a two-stage procedure, consisting of a preliminary Levene test on samples of different sizes with unequal variances, followed by either a Student pooled-variances t test or a Welch separate-variances t test. Simulations disclosed that the twostage procedure fails to protect the significance level and usually makes the situation worse. Earlier studies have shown that preliminary tests often adversely affect the size of the test, and also that the Welch test is superior to the t test when variances are unequal. The present simulations reveal that changes in Type I error rates are greater when sample sizes are smaller, when the difference in variances is slight rather than extreme, and when the significance level is more stringent. Furthermore, the validity of the Welch test deteriorates if it is used only on those occasions where a preliminary test indicates it is needed. Optimum protection is assured by using a separate-variances test unconditionally whenever sample sizes are unequal.","inCitations":["2527c77c80eb014e6055bac7649f4522a99be9de","54fb827b4ad2d1105cdced20e03f75daea20a23b","3ccc75818931e6e976455738c68bee28091f7f01","dc0ef966ffdd754256e0f7db1ef501e4d265c85c","19127e28ead5b60fc8ea90e779432d37aab14b9f","33b84b10d727b2051dbe59f99b9eb503b278d60a","acaf12db8b0eba6fa1a1799fe3ddc9041f5ca2e9","249bbb8ac45bdd9a789c59cc7cf5b39b816191c7","3ab2965b7c8c3b25eadfd2ffc47d872d2d8620ce","692344619fdf799e1db9dc7e3464b242ae5b7d21","f3d95b9413b675d99f0307aaabb21565e49d3777","0e88666ef74572dd3b2e171d5e631a64861baf61","51c9b7283c2ff72d485d83e0f6f05e030f0a685c","b796fbc2ffd8dbd7d404be9bbb38cecb94772fbc","d3366efd3f2f8b920d457ac2ba6b7f8347687927","ab5c3622d68cdb0943d4429d363eef00a13bf6ed","9df487b420e455b2aa4e1df85942dbbb2a102d30","f10f87cdda77ebbf0c3d3a555923ac5cc2fe2df9","61de8bc6fb9bb8cb8f06b8cbb4ec9de1474a8a4c","f5489d225f59ba356b96804a24d94cd04a1cc77a","0b301f2e7c840ab0b278718a838821d381f0540d","1db1b18d50e842514549e28ea6263e801ca6d580","3a2ad4e292651f15a791f65441681c2154fc7dd9","9abf4d76e728a76bd468ae8610580875f75f0aa9","7044a7f093bfd4be318ed172462e7ed2dcfdeab0","7fdddadc27b98adaa26fddf19cc1e7278e37b880","765dce94bcf50db3d73b7efd57cf6568f34c6b85","7fae09849448d98bc2f8888393c5da103f18ee42","7ee65b9b89adca9c83ad84775cc450485451d875","7d0c39c5194f82ade820ec44dc8f5d414ecb3506","4092b78b99ccf3c14d2e096b608a618bbb904b93","6cd3263ccff16fc15176d5700cf6e1cb8632d2b6","63ca6c351da29816851694a1d1d203a3ad467a99","6d682d3cedfcca783602770ed4b54bf396de2db1","b4e5be3d7c2c6cf219d8fdab71d50591ffdb04f7","4da0b546108f619ad7ba5f5b71a1dadc1fcb9f46","f47663265231fb3b9d178d247652b7c5eed10b57","ba1aebf8dc192283350c2e96541f6f27a0340e0e","0100eb3e0147a3245a027e94f3ea9582a8f5b96e","aaab30737860e748dcd4c30e2ddadaadfdfcdd31","b69d211dbce44919b882000b45df5cef55a69833","5fcd38fa30f35be44533658561fd4ec9fce1f9fb","e5cb6b5d6b46e888f707a1d2e965257ede73622e","26ac206b4da5d349a389982cac0dfdd530801b4d","7784effed9aa37e048dfe3e40ef0fe115e241ac5","f883c9aa8c70850ac6a077a03f6261b3eab60cc4","443473b8ac586718e17175f945ed2d9a7703108d","aef86b3136f883959d1c54d8d9a9f64f58b90d9c","1eacecd3288e68c06d8593b806d9e6e1ece5b9e0","429098ea0a60e7bd672216cddc9f71016944646f","b10e43d6bdf343a480571fa64be50db83c4cf7dd","b8cde8e81bdb5c09d31a0ebab257db8883bc05a1","0e09fac2be9655563847399195efeb28efb8be55","89d47b3beccc2ef7f0e40f76e9c9e9325b72f376","961c83c690e7597a7c0fe069e3578184e063ded9","f634b36289615a5647aa0b357cf9ccec7561ddd8","f17cbf94d9b8f6549f5dbf1b8ab9613c10bce683","5b150e5bab44d195c8997dba6b82c717ac478f18","f7ada18cab80da089cb883de268d5e47541243cb","f9752b51fcd41b9ef4ad1d1e0d054d00fef2e89d","17390886ce435cee06195780e9fb6873c086714c","80b3c901902acca446ddbab6f2c89987cbca3b56","0de0cbf6b97d84b3e50fbebfc44908a3a6c50d37","ca2274fb7c0040fb86cdf71a91468987980f84a6","3d8173e5761eeae16f4f6e62e0b78e79a5edd415","62c1c300df380c2fe83d8b650e27c4e7c7a546cc","926511fa25b44635d50dcbab92fa0e274ec09631","236c83d7803f129510347e9b134d9d847d91caca","ddf05fec9b4f89684c288bdcae166c28eede3585","6d0d654fc55a59b8f2a49350dd7e7470822c4a84","76672cf686f7d2e0f7debc473fc4f75b1e7ac882","0afe5bb0f012cbe5c9ef88c0cfb6ec50a55e5003","0960367919869545d7d9d5d032b9642fc2ecf6b7","3578d154a813a3a8258d519cc0617d22c25504b3","59e199692ad2da208ff43e7778a5255e6115b220","e05f0b85c26e174707d7d9b08b7c0daefb2349ed","bd06f25040d22460326cb081a3a93e212216f46b","8c5e5489bbaf1c7baf83f6cefa55e5ba57f2e251","b486c9954f6fb2f36bf851cca6cc4a07d478ce76","09f97ba45123a1044a0767d525506894ddc490f3","eb60819d53b0c557f6867f9c7fcb23730ff3c799","386175224a971c231e52dd51bab9340e27cd8626","a44dc7a681ddb3d0456f7f4021fe5920dbc99c66","f9163e70fe8efd98e83e05725a32ee9deb163084","4c77463c85c65a9aee63240c705113530f330163","12bb66e2a188a690c465b61d0b4df07e38524cc3","89f9adaeea9eeeb30cbedc8633ecb2fa4aa34fb8","e33b89299f40b36813bdbd69ac150de1fb2d5b4b","736e028d5cd892ae365114549ff380080596db2b","c8dcaba57b2ba20dddbc0d160bdd0891fb335e02","a9948f46c67615ca412a8eb06a5a0327c0ae94b8","d2ed281ffc124edcb2c927272e1d6f05fa22d41a","c406eb673c7b432bb00886f7fda43310fe42c370","67a04a460b41f3dfcceedfd162a14a9062cb7710","9258ba56cf867c5fa7d06def65a8984fa7d30291","68f3c1623325aafefd00b4d2a5c1fc841a7ca6e7"],"title":"A note on preliminary tests of equality of variances.","doi":"10.1348/000711004849222"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2005,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"There is often a need to determine parallelism or linearity between pairs of dose-response data sets for various biological applications. This article describes a technique based on a modification of the well-known extra-sum-of-squares principle of statistical regression. The standard extra-sum-of-squares method uses an F-distributed ratio as a statistic and an F-test based on this statistic as the parallelism test. It is shown here that this metric does not directly measure the parallelism between the two curves and can often vary in opposition to actual parallelism. To overcome this problem, a metric based on a chi-square test applied directly on the chi-square-distributed extra-sum-of-squares statistic is developed, which is shown to correspond directly to parallelism. This parallelism metric does not suffer from the shortcomings of the conventional F-test-based metric, and is a more reliable and appropriate measure of parallelism. The article also shows that the choice of curve model has a large effect on the sensitivity of either metric, and that using an asymmetric model, such as the asymmetric five-parameter logistic function, a generalization of the commonly used symmetric four-parameter logistic function, is necessary when working with asymmetric dose-response data. The effect of noise, as well as the importance of correct weighting on the parallelism metrics and the relative potency, is also studied.","inCitations":["d22d0e633d5a5606a9961d8daba378f984605e1c","7a098cdcbd82eb6727e253738bbccbb553dded62","41e7cb45365bd1bb30ebb90737cf4e78d818e036","9b96d97edcbae7972bd8bc0eee3581d95ed9fc71","39d5e472ca4e77534b003da8e14697b49eed5b43","3f1c9443e00a233f67b4d77fcaf0dbd7dc080610","7b343588562f250a99063d08bdd041d97a12d913","5ca11839a188a8c9f9fe7718a58c0e0c418c0a52","16db69994b97025d560f8512ef01b91892d01990","c7f3a1160b3df5f62ce035b219e6c935b2f557b4","b397d80e459d9030dcfd7a47d9b8d8c7c2dd9b2b","f27ffd9b345ee1b8fb6977798b4f6ce8f54bb656","f10af528e082e2f49b18fe2b7973153ba61f0722","428758296a700d850c50a85546881772c7c8ab42","f9845b6cc32f59b9795d25d57fcfa41d5e6ccbf5","ed0c68b9f8fff76ac01e245475d87f6ae0d7183a","6e5f18cd2238e983e43ebeaf5ef3c4b2dc9077b2","4e556dddb1b9f78468462d50ba0a9c9f32586890","ef0b6f8a54cbed859e68ec420d354d5cfe25be95","86cefebe0ba4f3daf0faa8c64a58bcab3eeb5faa","8e18f0549174563fab04a88913221cce21fdb232","db8fcdc73ed19c00b981ee7d2ad6b2c8064d6c24","eac3a918d7f1fb6b11215e1efe84f3c6263ad102","fbe13ca9a4a21be6db4546c5c58ce59a2eadcf11","19a98459aec311d9e3f9bcbeaf277377eae2d64a","e571081ee981aa731cf52516c7c57ae1b2080d91","0e9dbbc022ea208c5de866c77a726eb011cd7ad8","56218904cca93eb1d8582589afb9910fef1c0d68","cc3887100d94b52815edf58e3be8214debd3ebc4"],"title":"Measuring parallelism, linearity, and relative potency in bioassay and immunoassay data.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200056532"}

These models often consider treatment allocation and repeated measures at the individual level. We extend SNMMs to clustered observations with time-varying confounding and treatments. We demonstrate how to formulate models with both cluster- and unit-level treatments and show how to derive semiparametric estimators of parameters in such models. For unit-level treatments, we consider interference, namely the effect of treatment on outcomes in other units of the same cluster. The properties of estimators are evaluated through simulations and compared with the conventional GEE regression method for clustered outcomes. To illustrate our method, we use data from the treatment arm of a glaucoma clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of two commonly used ocular hypertension medications.","inCitations":["28afc452a894fe95a3741c3105cfc5d9df3f9dea","274d7c5c674570b40fdf61e43bb2cbcdbd607512"],"title":"Structural Nested Mean Models to Estimate the Effects of Time-Varying Treatments on Clustered Outcomes","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2014-0055"}

On the one hand, eigenvalues of diffusion tensors (DTs) estimated from diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data usually contain systematic bias, which subsequently biases the diffusivity measurements popularly adopted in fiber tracking algorithms. On the other hand, correctly accounting for the spatial information is important in the construction of these diffusivity measurements since the fiber tracts are typically spatially structured. This paper aims to establish test-based approaches to identify anisotropic water diffusion areas in the human brain. These areas in turn indicate the areas passed by fiber tracts. Our proposed test statistic not only takes into account the bias components in eigenvalue estimates, but also incorporates the spatial information of neighboring voxels. Under mild regularity conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed test statistic asymptotically follows a χ2 distribution under the null hypothesis. Simulation and real DTI data examples are provided to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed methods.","inCitations":["d78567f3395c1af4b6108644805eb3a4b2c17b2e","9e41e0bc6a7c12dfcbeae02bd288e3070bfc8ee1","d5174d36d3f2f29eaf100e87a039fcbacfea444d","2baa53b05ed75a2b20f0f474b9e821877b6101ce"],"title":"Local Tests for Identifying Anisotropic Diffusion Areas in Human Brain with DTI.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS573"}

Computational statistics","paperAbstract":"Many important stochastic counting models can be written as general birth-death processes (BDPs). BDPs are continuous-time Markov chains on the non-negative integers in which only jumps to adjacent states are allowed. BDPs can be used to easily parameterize a rich variety of probability distributions on the non-negative integers, and straightforward conditions guarantee that these distributions are proper. BDPs also provide a mechanistic interpretation - birth and death of actual particles or organisms - that has proven useful in evolution, ecology, physics, and chemistry. Although the theoretical properties of general BDPs are well understood, traditionally statistical work on BDPs has been limited to the simple linear (Kendall) process. Aside from a few simple cases, it remains impossible to find analytic expressions for the likelihood of a discretely-observed BDP, and computational difficulties have hindered development of tools for statistical inference. But the gap between BDP theory and practical methods for estimation has narrowed in recent years. There are now robust methods for evaluating likelihoods for realizations of BDPs: finite-time transition, first passage, equilibrium probabilities, and distributions of summary statistics that arise commonly in applications. Recent work has also exploited the connection between continuously- and discretely-observed BDPs to derive EM algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. Likelihood-based inference for previously intractable BDPs is much easier than previously thought and regression approaches analogous to Poisson regression are straightforward to derive. In this review, we outline the basic mathematical theory for BDPs and demonstrate new tools for statistical inference using data from BDPs.","inCitations":["ae69a0db1139e850299aa7fa37d8f71902a80ccb","4d307ca0a4f9922aecee80738301fba88d5d8ac4"],"title":"Computational methods for birth-death processes.","doi":"10.1002/wics.1423"}

Then construction of the marker statistics is followed by outlier detection approaches. The method provides a new way to build up a binary tree that can accurately capture change-point signals and is easy to perform.

Our goal is to predict future death rates until the year 2010, separately for males and females. Since age and period are not measured on the same grid, we propose a generalized APC model where consecutive cohort parameters represent strongly overlapping birth cohorts. This approach results in a rather large number of parameters, where standard algorithms for statistical inference by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods turn out to be computationally intensive. We propose a more efficient implementation based on ideas of block sampling from the time series literature. We entertain two different formulations, penalizing either first or second differences of age, period and cohort parameters. To assess the predictive quality of both formulations, we first forecast the rates for the period 1987-1996 based on data until 1986. A comparison with the actual observed rates is made based on a predictive deviance criterion. Predictions of lung cancer mortality until 2010 are then reported and a modification of the formulation in order to include information on cigarette consumption is finally described.To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Interference can distort research conclusions about causal effects when not accounted for properly. In the absence of interference, inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators are commonly used to estimate causal effects from observational data. Recently, IPW estimators have been extended to handle interference. Tchetgen Tchetgen and VanderWeele (2012) proposed IPW methods to estimate direct and indirect (or spillover) effects that allow for interference between individuals within groups. In this paper, we present inferference, an R package that computes these IPW causal effect estimates when interference may be present within groups. We illustrate use of the package with examples from political science and infectious disease.","inCitations":["68d2d253019b856b2c495274a094a358323b39ec"],"title":"A Recipe for inferference: Start with Causal Inference.
