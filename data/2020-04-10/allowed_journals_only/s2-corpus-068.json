However, although there are significant differences in the proportions of same sex and mixed sex families having an additional child, the overall effect on average family size of the (apparent) attempt to achieve a child of each sex appears to be slight—an increase of less than 3% in the case of the Melbourne data. \n \n \n \nDespite the evidence that a significantly greater proportion of women with same sex families have another child, relatively few women admit that the sex structure of the children was the main factor in such a decision. Another insight into the relationship between sex structure and family building was that the desire for a child of each sex may have a negative effect on fertility in that couples who have already achieved such a configuration may decide not to have an additional child that they had originally planned to have. \n \n \n \nObviously, it is difficult to separate attitudes to the importance of having both sons and daughters from rationalisations associated with the sex structure of the respondent's own family. Nevertheless the desire for children of each sex seems to be related to traditional attitudes to woman's role, Southern European background, an earlier year of birth, and a lower level of education. However, at the same time women in these categories, particularly the last, seem to be relatively less likely to exhibit behaviour indicative of a controlled response to the sex structure of the family; thus among such groups the probability of same sex families having another child is found to be relatively similar to the proportion of mixed sex families having another child. In other words, they are less likely than other women, who care less about having both sons and daughters, to stop at two (or three) children when at least one son and one daughter have been attained. \n \n \n \nWhat of the future relationship between proportions of same sex and mixed sex families having another child? Although it would seem that the combined effect of better educational opportunities and less traditional attitudes of each new generation would further reduce the importance attached to having both sons and daughters, at the same time one would expect an increase in a couple's ability to stop family building when two or three children of the desired sex structure had been achieved. Another factor is that possibly an increasing preference for smaller families will outweigh the wish to have a third (or fourth) child to achieve one child of each sex or for any other reason.","inCitations":["17012f60046eff5729281f6236851c85bf08bdc8","615cbbc7ca54c5fee382f54cd4612b2334ad986b","992e99bc145238078fb37ce9522c8948be77c186","2ca330bcc02d275bef3b3557d867596400957a95","aa4bbbee47747f47604834b4a77e0ad5b3f3eaae","5f80c695305632fd2b4bae702d292abe2511df8e","3ee362ac698792ad6685b8f077ab5b2c4c4a8fcf","8103005ae64ac9f85d1269ef1c885b287579d458"],"title":"Family building differences between same sex and mixed sex families in Australia.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-842X.1977.tb01274.x"}

This model partitions the groups into a number of clusters according to the covariance structure of the data of each group and performs a simultaneous component analysis with invariant pattern restrictions (SCA-P) for each cluster. These restrictions imply that the model allows for between-group differences in the variances and the correlations of the cluster-specific components. As such, clusterwise SCA-P is more flexible than the earlier proposed clusterwise SCA-ECP model, which imposed equal average cross-products constraints on the component scores of the groups that belong to the same cluster. Using clusterwise SCA-P, a finer-grained, yet parsimonious picture of the group differences and similarities can be obtained. An algorithm for fitting clusterwise SCA-P solutions is presented and its performance is evaluated by means of a simulation study. The value of the model for empirical research is illustrated with data from psychiatric diagnosis research.","inCitations":["6679431320b8d1db8b4aa75e428801847e35457b","242c527f06f975715f68826c7b6fd1d1b5c31fbf","779e661c7a02829c69f68996705c0177f7849494","4ab4ef53c28614065e8d3db3a7faf9f81db6be7f","884b508b2eb75da9f9e6b1fe88f8a5fb4c98e194","ca62f92468d486fbe84cf0ab23ac32ada57396f0","641528142d9c17e3f0c8d0ed18fe947f29b41766","d6fed0803ca4961d853b2c14b3bce1d23d7a9701","29f399ebcb314c7bb801c43a86b1590f0acefe89","6b44f1b9c05d27b7c095d4948393ff2b092bf3fe","93717fdf3bab3723ca14acb3f8c8a42f110fb33d","ff0e34f8b6cb56b717474233e7b53c10c0421cff","0971c232f153ea3fd1d1efe781fd1fc6830f2490","91e5d934c77eb182c65758a47934c45e2cca263b","38f86056d42774c9bfe6cf1e23e2d7eccc264ae2","d3d3002d3fa419da571180f75e40a60e37c8d338","267993a133bb14a7848d670dd878dbe70f26abfa"],"title":"A clusterwise simultaneous component method for capturing within-cluster differences in component variances and correlations.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02040.x"}

The proposed method is very fast, scalable to studies including ultra-high dimensional data, and can easily be adapted to and executed on modest computing infrastructures. The method is applied to the longitudinal analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of the corpus callosum of multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects. The study includes 176 subjects observed at 466 visits. For each subject and visit the study contains a registered DTI scan of the corpus callosum at roughly 30,000 voxels.","inCitations":["2148b760cb3bc752164b25893961b8dbf600817d","f6f74d14155e063dfd58314a17e0f77544befade","9d2aa689305a0fb4230af70c7e05fdcb030aa182","b3f4962eb10961472e2607f74911d2eef91573b9","297f54108d026936a321d723fe922e7b45cbd576","a4333299de0c7b57ce4b21c83cddf3434cdfc8c8","ab040939cf6e23d8f9d6052d2a085e46bc8d8806","dcfcf47269e9192fdb143e59c54a02296f42ad64","f7fd2a051ffe498b33a182af762729e127f2f76f","289c48730d03c93ba4112956d11774289ff698e7","e7b6147a558454f355fd0a6a83fe7ad96346d019","10570195dce4613d9e9083dab780e8f31f1920c3","ca87e521518127336dc79f869d0f64f8b27bd5a6","b3a2670dc08d3d26fb3616a78526d03d62293957","c454c69cfd9a9ba0425251bd6be3a7d07e027a94"],"title":"Longitudinal High-Dimensional Principal Components Analysis with Application to Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Multiple Sclerosis.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS748"}

This is a drawback because process models are helpful in clarifying the meaning of the latent traits. In the present paper, a new model for responses and response times in tests is presented. The model is based on the proportional hazards model for competing risks. Two processes are assumed, one reflecting the increase in knowledge and the second the tendency to discontinue. The processes can be characterized by two proportional hazards models whose baseline hazard functions correspond to the temporary increase in knowledge and discouragement. The model can be calibrated with marginal maximum likelihood estimation and an application of the ECM algorithm. Two tests of model fit are proposed. The amenability of the proposed approaches to model calibration and model evaluation is demonstrated in a simulation study. Finally, the model is used for the analysis of two empirical data sets.","inCitations":["44ea57b4b6e88d41780764ce57a9a07bad5c5875","095d55ad16de19a5794daccd5d2c0e2535a52030","edebeed3da337562dd348ea4d44fedb42c2b7d30","8ebc63a9542a82fa6d645fc2d9baab31ee7cd6ef","f9ceb8e72c3656c5cbd9f37653898b8ed5ec6651","945b035e2dc886eff3133d3413d33d8a7b402b62","290fe40d1df0c30ea611b547afd1b2b5b12fddb4"],"title":"An accumulator model for responses and response times in tests based on the proportional hazards model.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12025"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2006,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"We present a review of statistical inference in generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). GLMMs are an extension of generalized linear models and are suitable for the analysis of non-normal data with a clustered structure. A GLMM contains parameters common to all clusters (fixed regression effects and variance components) and cluster-specific parameters. The latter parameters are assumed to be randomly drawn from a population distribution. The parameters of this population distribution (the variance components) have to be estimated together with the fixed effects. We focus on the case in which the cluster-specific parameters are normally distributed. The cluster-specific effects are integrated out of the likelihood so that the fixed effects and variance components can be estimated. Unfortunately, the integral over the cluster-specific effects is intractable for most GLMMs with a normal mixing distribution. Within a classical statistical framework, we distinguish between two broad classes of methods to handle this intractable integral: methods that rely on a numerical approximation to the integral and methods that use an analytical approximation to the integrand. Finally, we present an overview of available methods for testing hypotheses about the parameters of GLMMs.","inCitations":["8a1cc99e48df21e53e4fd91a96f07c890aa064b5","f5fd6ccdd9ff9b721f0dc734e9b086db7ce495f1","65f7fb6b2f045086e1877677700a93bc201c048a","d6fb2b43ccdaa1a605b631275af467749e12206d","7bf2afe5deed548d0980fc18179ae497f9646473","1a0bbdf7b033ecec2e32d80c743e7420a320ff2a","ddd793df5dbce92f9e510d6901228c09211c8c9b","5ea3df6e12ece9b3af281be06f36291ff08829ec","3b95009cf5e2234f336d2749f0418a1b20297a0c","5cf6d63f4e168ac404752b493579aa13ce7852d5","834fda646357f0e3cf9e3ff6e1eb048e23717827","88951315b68b2f6f2724450ca812754c61d0b180","1c9e31c1d56f05b0cd4f3813e3e84c3c62b329f3","b9587e2be9e5f5b9eb33f18fb8695d69e7fada7b","d68bdd7f5dc47dbc53b618284a9d4e80b77a234b","d5800f7734cbd30610e3d015841bc9767b13141a","3d7f9682a179a6bb32343c7b2d879d108839755b","6e7050e0d642ebe152c11839f73375629b14afe3","347ae1711f44ca82d365bab6790ea99edc6befe2","d114f00325426912a1135cc9e01eb3b56b92bb70","ccbc7e7acf5028dab913d47726c10a507915479b","dd92cbdea39275b69fe15fe3f8d76606611fae73","193ad4b5c1eb5515f093ae8db52d53216ad7f529","5746cdaa6c3ad29e9a73b1a9bfc570e097cf4cb3","56d695c27f65ef84ab4f789e1032dd793e38f11f","055d656d4f6438381907d0b5304feb790b813087","65665e0d8ff59b2a4b1b148b833621a401b2760a","0ad9c453fa6239f961f736a7a3a8b5b356e823d0","267303a2dd47bef1d7510b0872a3d4c45c7822bf","d265fa1d93f70c5d23f5e369c682cb3dc6073f23","5b45ef2a9f0028e618474757ce1b10182565a1b9","75d9f16af8303f88125948e41e77dc7f083af9f1","8abe4b0aaeeccb3ba394e54cf9c66922803066d7","2b31006e76d3e98fa11b6d3e48f26a5f92de4a49","5e7d5d8526d807f099fa2395affffb9cf766b225","652db5ee5c39fa11546390e6ea40823ab8ebafa5","01277e9884917e1918e4ce195962b2524061f316","418067887b93573783248c37e24d702cdc6c162c","8c29cc4aa927e94456ef1fa1f8edda9e2b797f42","326efb70041581faf92ab2fda6debb5694e16847","07a9ff34a8e1b762832871841c5f03059070a7ee","e1f58a4d2b6629d1587ab59f58a669ee1aab871e","d6b4f94dd9d3557d2b64d921e9d3f846a731a0f6","71c3750112bc8af4014e802d6e5ee9c928ffaa1e","f69d66e1768c245e155d0166a530a400c07b802f","58c50c8c8db3e1fc31e76c649528fd5d1e953733","8453633b78a933bf2c35c41930afd2873012a954","7c15d9758af4b37718280637620ba62ce8443762","397195ee484788e631ff1113fd2236400d4ca683","d06ae474c8ffc270b1a86362de4d2a5e4b3aaef9","3452eb337e1016368df755c321854ef924553b83","20dd78a92ba69b035cd2323b0fd9c3f33045d756","43247dc7248c72c61bba22029379d7b3f1d3ad88","115bfc35c5301a63565c14819abd7b8cf8b9d8f6","bf53167a5c312300af148c9d5dd614f7a800284f","3cf9b0debc3a06c7d45ed4b929a0b5a852696d12","66340594b54a8ddf412ce366a1a00c1c5223bd69","04d38275507c0a802e84d3239acef5204e925b92","9508d20fd459991d78f35c70150838d4ceca63ac","9df13056a7eaa9e6d99b4856273185f2cbf4ef5e","a5fda2529db7e2d63a5c323ced6b14c9dff4263e","dfd6d1e72fd72ac4f5d25bdbf09bb948505e3fe3","a9220f098f6f0b9268182017df0f28b5ff71a8e2","d46927287b93a5be07136e400645528aad368350","a61b7c886a75bcf522502bb5263ecb9a780fdcca","5df0b38b7349c59a52ca3d56a04f758728e05cf1","34fd88f9ae4928777339486ad20bd93fe7f570fd","a5e5151704f81419eeab20561779f202f5e3b53e","46862aabff20eb7447c83056488b68cbad81494c","f287942f4c0189303bc5b23fa5b723031cd96458","5032d10e672585c9614f75f2811e89284f0168c6","25536bb3d00ea36878bac12d3084214bbb468a10","7e157fd6dd98bb6ede7ff57fba9e461d7e615c49","ba3f03890c6649ea3a65026bd56085f84c0529fb","deddf858933aeea97b2513a729758373ef36c50e"],"title":"Statistical inference in generalized linear mixed models: a review.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X79857"}

Neither is it well known whether personality exercises an influence predominantly at the beginning and development of addiction, nor whether drug consumption produces changes in personality. This paper presents a dynamic mathematical model of personality and addiction based on the unique personality trait theory (UPTT) and the general modelling methodology. This model attempts to integrate personality, the acute effect of drugs, and addiction. The UPTT states the existence of a unique trait of personality called extraversion, understood as a dimension that ranges from impulsive behaviour and sensation-seeking (extravert pole) to fearful and anxious behaviour (introvert pole). As a consequence of drug consumption, the model provides the main patterns of extraversion dynamics through a system of five coupled differential equations. It combines genetic extraversion, as a steady state, and dynamic extraversion in a unique variable measured on the hedonic scale. The dynamics of this variable describes the effects of stimulant drugs on a short-term time scale (typical of the acute effect); while its mean time value describes the effects of stimulant drugs on a long-term time scale (typical of the addiction effect). This understanding may help to develop programmes of prevention and intervention in drug misuse.","inCitations":["0c49a8d3d46582f7456a2f7b83570d6e82277d8f","b9181386d7a340304eac8e815d78833ddcaa97e3","99c99b1c45bab2012d392ab59819da501b020dc1","7f5b26a2ba29c6ab7c1c08233208dd433b1a4558","6b437e9625f1c3b9c590134d158fd67b8ee642ef","e72cc2b12fa34637bff7e83d61133fb108aca301","dfc4355d0ec815f787306c79a2dcd312d3cc8fca","f56dc66135ff6da331360c8ab9015f09f56e80eb","274b745a5d32286d6d5e82e697db62ed5eb788a8","c7b1be7d79e105ccef17fd800eec8847376abd29","5fc4bc51c9666475ddc83a1ea8bab64a4302d1b4","e691f594402b957d555ec9603ebd13ca17fd1b86","922545d9ff9e2c627eea7ccc75f3db22732bbd08","06e0d83a0cc9606c537165ed43422f5d45286d52","98a255a93b4e7d31a0fd07a09f0417837ae7f72c","f6701523d151819edd65905e9da725f0f7105420"],"title":"Cocaine addiction and personality: a mathematical model.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X470768"}

Time-dependent covariates are generally observed intermittently and with error. For a single time-dependent covariate, a popular approach is to assume a joint longitudinal data-survival model, where the time-dependent covariate follows a linear mixed effects model and the hazard of failure depends on random effects and time-independent covariates via a proportional hazards relationship. Regression calibration and likelihood or Bayesian methods have been advocated for implementation; however, generalization to more than one time-dependent covariate may become prohibitive. For a single time-dependent covariate, Tsiatis and Davidian (2001) have proposed an approach that is easily implemented and does not require an assumption on the distribution of the random effects. This technique may be generalized to multiple, possibly correlated, time-dependent covariates, as we demonstrate. We illustrate the approach via simulation and by application to data from an HIV clinical trial.","inCitations":["f8e2c0aeb23e61b15d96f4d35dc7618724f9aa14","1cf74aaab3b63b7401eaab0c95df30c0f8b55f2d","128fa39f1bcc44fcd9235b674032832a23f9adad","93e4a744163fe30ee96670e33ae47801cae2bf95","3827c6598c34264f55f11d5eade18ab32ebb383f","f508e0ee7943f4e6ff07806580385aadc4f5bcc7","8902fefb4d415ec84c88a85b21d2d04ff06ac84d","0b8821856433d2cc3d8480834c7f17645ec53ab0","b1c0cadd7363bca82da9a7d2ddbaf059997c089e","000151a5ffc7272e3645994227d80812e1e9f73f","516b280fcb1ddf9187566952dac414a1313942ea","e2faa9bfef620496b235fb3b1addad88115ff657","48efc98e411102e9f8f4aad3acb2aa9b0d30e8e2","07c8465478986200421845115c6b64c99cda5c95","8a4516ddbe8b5e6a07295118b7c36ba2b579fa45","7e557c6c3c5dc287f1c772c234afcd61c666b934","d12917896863f85e5c7271c5e5e323e08cc2a1c7","7fb553cb706957a343b1b15b5a8902ef10cf7d0b","dd4bf6636f298d1143962252268ffef2c029af3e","1f788c44f2866a0f82e548b64adf1f2486786d23","a7cab72e3141109f583b23656bf3f3e19d05ee25","89409ed4a03343d53b0de555bf08d27a6bcd1dc3","4fbe5e95693df02edfded4fbecbfe7ee06610366","b2e51befdfc5252a2e113890f3ecf5b11874e7a4","fde8c462b06973a6bb9e708e06fe1aaea87fc1ad","54bfb5650793e61f62f9a20cec822523cc18f041","cfb412833b0a73481cb01bfae32eb77a2ed2d7e6","7c48abca4a545c94e1fed135dbc88631b69e19bd","32e46cdc069e14cb0805f5bca436058e1cbd99c1","91c220120b200282e551230c5d232edc8a20befb","2ca563fb4847ec7cb921c4fffa562e8002da34cf","dd3610f34bcadb99c04503c94686707a29cf469e","c69376b16bbc88eaa7934a08f2f1b2f1bf7b06bd","c465d04b67fb265357bd2b744ea6ef9417b9fdf0","80647d524e8d2356d6eb664ebccad7fd3d171d94","7ecbfc42e3a8a0cca23915940cd8de14eb40b039","c8b25c41e068b873f46753911d340dd90e1b322f","fd1b2b0c4e43dca1fda7c9b96488d2ad97890879","1ae5286b3dfcf8217bb50b31cb9fe441590c0d6c","f55e0d5f56f9c50e3f1e3f5a577a8a4e8477c89a","6888124409bfb8b1091b793306f5bec71a1aced9","cba8b26dc01167e8b34d4e6a31e1329ff18216eb","afa811f178f64aa1b02c607ad4e08fe3bee384a5","7454f03a3b0eb99e01ab0e6f83163e9db696986b","9a2cafa106a207c49c833bfccd32e2491e49fb79","5fab0f516e603021f86551692a2f28e28ca1d4a6","9298620b98c75f8868b312a50bb14720b3d741e7","55df972b9360e1a8618c63b6d99acab02e526dd6","1fc935282374f8d9d3012df1bcb814a83e99cf5b","f156dd9ede81ef958cd998a9dd9b6661527e69c8","67c351a0f9c300b4a1c80ca25dc963f0e438197d","8195ff0e89859167a41c6c762e9a02b6b9bcadfa","018757fea7a84bb69f08647e70e00051a43b8df8","183edfc757a518bc7672f451b5a74dc7d0144a65","1f44fcbc7f3308a6ae6ec4d7d399937c369e82ac","06d7beca53bd2c1f0da36b473727c5f08400999c","cbee125c71d7536d3d1786228bb6067954ec8b6f","3f1923318d1ac5b28e3a489f0abfd166a26c861b","27c78ebb125e1d5f2a2e9372bc381b753e08fb74","f01ac0dcc064fddcaca337d4beff1ac5b1055146"],"title":"An estimator for the proportional hazards model with multiple longitudinal covariates measured with error.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.4.511"}

The Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) Instrumental Variables (IV) procedure is frequently used but is not applicable to time-to-event data if some observations are censored. We develop a simultaneous equations model (SEM) to account for unmeasured confounding of the effect of treatment on survival time subject to censoring. The identification of the treatment effect is assisted by IVs (variables related to treatment but conditional on treatment not to the outcome) and the assumed bivariate distribution underlying the data generating process. The methodology is illustrated on data from an observational study of time to death following endovascular or open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. As the IV and the distributional assumptions cannot be jointly assessed from the observed data, we evaluate the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions.","inCitations":["84b36fafb514588c87aca3a3eac70f155ae26b81","740ed4b1bf9538f89bfe582b53b30875c801f7e9"],"title":"Estimating the Causal Effect of Treatment in Observational Studies with Survival Time Endpoints and Unmeasured Confounding.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12158"}

There are considerable researches focusing on zero-inflated models such as zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) models for such zero-inflated count data when used as response variable. However, when such variables are used as predictors, the difference between structural and random zeros is often ignored and may result in biased estimates. One remedy is to include an indicator of the structural zero in the model as a predictor if observed. However, structural zeros are often not observed in practice, in which case no statistical method is available to address the bias issue. This paper is aimed to fill this methodological gap by developing parametric methods to model zero-inflated count data when used as predictors based on the maximum likelihood approach. The response variable can be any type of data including continuous, binary, count or even zero-inflated count responses. Simulation studies are performed to assess the numerical performance of this new approach when sample size is small to moderate. A real data example is also used to demonstrate the application of this method.","inCitations":["8cbabc7dadd89ac6ad6a57b3a4e86c050d334c83"],"title":"Untangle the Structural and Random Zeros in Statistical Modelings.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2017.1391180"}

In this study, we adopt a sieve approach for the estimation of nonparametric covariate effects in semiparametric regression models. We adopt a two-step iterated penalization approach for variable selection. In the first step, a mixture of the Lasso and group Lasso penalties are employed to conduct the first-round variable selection and obtain the initial estimate. In the second step, a mixture of the weighted Lasso and weighted group Lasso penalties, with weights constructed using the initial estimate, are employed for variable selection. We show that the proposed iterated approach has the variable selection consistency property, even when number of unknown parameters diverges with sample size. Numerical studies, including simulation and analysis of a diabetes dataset, show satisfactory performance of the proposed approach.","inCitations":["1f22cf44814a1f0d1501e7b93d2705a4c9ab2969"],"title":"Variable selection for semiparametric regression models with iterated penalization.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2012.661054"}

Self-report scales rely on the assumption that their items elicit information only about the trait they are supposed to measure. However, different response biases may threaten this assumption. Specifically, in children, the response style of acquiescence is an important source of systematic error. Balanced scales, including an equal number of positively and negatively keyed items, have been proposed as a solution to control for acquiescence, but the reasons why this design feature worked from the perspective of modern psychometric models have been underexplored. Three methods for controlling for acquiescence are compared: classical method by partialling out the mean; an item response theory method to measure differential person functioning (DPF); and multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) with random intercept. Comparative analyses are conducted on simulated ratings and on self-ratings provided by 40,649 students (aged 11-18) on a fully balanced 30-item scale assessing conscientious self-management. Acquiescence bias was explained as DPF and it was demonstrated that: the acquiescence index is highly related to DPF; balanced scales produce scores controlled for DPF; and MIRT factor scores are highly related to scores controlled for DPF and the random intercept is highly related to DPF.","inCitations":["de7c4c24380009b1a74ee1e8b67e5eeaa54961ec"],"title":"Comparison of classical and modern methods for measuring and correcting for acquiescence.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12168"}

For example, physicians may initiate combined antiretroviral therapy the first time an individual's recorded CD4 cell count drops below either 500 cells/mm3 or 350 cells/mm3. This paper describes an approach for using observational data to emulate randomized clinical trials that compare dynamic regimes of the form initiate treatment within a certain time period of some time-varying covariate first crossing a particular threshold.\" We applied this method to data from the French Hospital database on HIV (FHDH-ANRS CO4), an observational study of HIV-infected patients, in order to compare dynamic regimes of the form initiate treatment within m months after the recorded CD4 cell count first drops below x cells/mm3\" where x takes values from 200 to 500 in increments of 10 and m takes values 0 or 3. We describe the method in the context of this example and discuss some complications that arise in emulating a randomized experiment using observational data.","inCitations":["a502f93c63954ee77e8b7275799e95203b41356e","f1232b518ae4b7f05647e68e5db69a753c55eb3c","7d416d8b6201af8c06e05aa74f7a4ea5f4cdba83","5b00c26576f45320f009aa8f5e5b8dc553a179c2","5a61cda48fc34552ac849efb7795787fedd60eab","cec2ed400373240d88d4d7f3d0a0449c13342a0a","22a3257ff121b693b10e5cc6ae923847909976da","53586db3da5eaf80526965192e87e0f56f19630c","959c04545adae3962aaf712af92106ec27a87207","3dfab9215aed2d0d11b8db1f9ae0d674c0b3baa9","9ae558e7ebb645b445dc9e0b47c80f00739999f8","d615c8e8e5683e39d98495de532e20881f31d1cf","b7168ba6706836178b8ef4a850d281f33fc0bc89","90a1973e41d7d8fdc1cc083c930f823e9e80882c","fb721f1a69544c15426c266afcf3c84eed269d9a","7136ff99fb115b986bd5a8ee20c831600ee2e157","ac7b38c7eb07f234b2fdc0360c5a48aa35f273ab","c4afb65d0308f5ad1bb8410b8ea714b98a4d491b","407a22876ac2a0e1b8a7764fd12a669c4c313c81","611d2b955143d2c9ef10b2b169775cb05b53b748","92508e53a87dad1fb476247a15d3be9f5a36ac13","3426592c30dc50a893da1ce92a19b68ee6045cad","b0b2c40e5689c5e0f6cf234d2ad48c6151da2efc","b10d75fd4a2ed327ae0e40acaffea67734b3eb87","3d92aaa4f22fd3a56055ec419c6d8810ef99a185","1aee87b6b8962bd1673833cd84446118d5fb6caf","141c7da697d620c116c0db1717c73d8bc0cb4268","8e8b74f49b6cabde2ce36cf90653758d9186f1c6","2e8da638ae14f74845629ee1c2661b9731006966","9a704d2c98552f03c3c0d021b13876bcc359245e","0b3cca04288efdaa16d1667e8ab4e873df77e8d1","33d1299a47e53c639321c8d3dd47b89983b3a352","f83c84a25acfc3d2d4aa3b0cbe049ef3fb6273b7","7f9e2b59a904c751bfe1fed565f9c71360f85691","9a39f5b8643dbd5a778d8df156dd1cd70476908b","e1cad477d89724410abbfc9624299df9fa91c686","cb8500f6e8c9b7200f16f1ab147fdc617af2f15b","b634bfa3f51c69ecadf627a316aded489d460067","a0b9e8038ab31541c477d141b164d108d391996e","4fb7518a316c7f1df34a83df0c1ac25e2b28b9a5","99bd33c676f13eed1b6282e7d8aff43646442a63","574e8ceee80a6907f1918c7e647325f74f5530e3","4b697934a24ddd7a09e702890cfb4ef5d09762e2","89a9f10a089555b5a91619cc7e863c7952bec1d0","1f3e0a8da1bede2d3af9631c43f4f1554bc40657","a2cc5da9a16a9460a43644d642e436f360c6a392","7bc439185ddc789dc2fb76df8b53518f0762551c","057022a1a9d64faa2fb185f00d35274fca2cb8ff","9f6a7c3d65e159f6f8cdde1aead27f03e726ce9b","fbf90e98bd73494b85905b90a763284f74a093be","924fa7f9b60b6bd2d0bd6775afffff6bac0979f9","78ba6ac771c8f45d1b24aca04669886145e6ac40","67bbe6c34cd7e0512e87deb31080786a2522a70e","a1153519fdd6a696958dffc8b7a8b817e53bdcce","fe88ecf240782077d68d21cdbf2a78673e6a0e7a","9ae35d2d35d5399c158f1acf3704638f65331464","3804dc718e4b7b66126c6db7ca68cb9e73eb52da","c5485cfad84936838da1b2fe0abee26cbb7b371c","02d7edf1af0ac11d3ee94e25b839a4c956d4c58e","eba82e05120159fb6d1ee9b214e8ad3f2cfa65e0","13e5e5598db443874b80799a831b096b6f31c709","cfe411daa97190ef24f37cd96e9d754093d239c1","2eef3a88017889a94d4ab0a4562821ebfba93c8a","e5437e8b7315f1dfe6c96f2166cf86f2f0e26e98","97bb9a2fe26f49d712ef2a0d9e79cb5cf5a23be2","25912ef69b3e42f9d1f56d8b197ce5a012f17280","f2d88c434fbd965893f603deb619d4c6d4d9ccc1","f76aee5e2204833e12a87734f4098e0da1c2fd34","ef93d9cb099adf706de21e5f83bd48e23d2099ab","82bfd3aa19fe3ce5a4f14103fb3f0ecb15d198d9","2996e6ca65c6b509cff525f84f57e3964a65b6ae","5aa7e80340064efc128b218ee3b5036cb85fd5d6","b0b6e8bde49aab0c61973594a3ee072bbdaf8d23","df41c4f5aa934861c524f22273fba05219174788","ce1eef1a97c1e34f272fa4b73b2ea3e2fed9638c","28fcf238ad3a523e45277091ae1b9349ac55d0c6"],"title":"When to Start Treatment?

Such point-referenced or geostatistical data are often best analyzed with Bayesian hierarchical models. Unfortunately, fitting such models involves computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods whose efficiency depends upon the specific problem at hand. This requires extensive coding on the part of the user and the situation is not helped by the lack of available software for such algorithms. Here, we introduce a statistical software package, spBayes, built upon the R statistical computing platform that implements a generalized template encompassing a wide variety of Gaussian spatial process models for univariate as well as multivariate point-referenced data.

Most up‐to‐date eQTL studies consider the connection between genetic variation and expression in a single tissue. Multi‐tissue analyses have the potential to improve findings in a single tissue, and elucidate the genotypic basis of differences between tissues. In this article, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model (MT‐eQTL) for multi‐tissue eQTL analysis. MT‐eQTL explicitly captures patterns of variation in the presence or absence of eQTL, as well as the heterogeneity of effect sizes across tissues. We devise an efficient Expectation‐Maximization (EM) algorithm for model fitting. Inferences concerning eQTL detection and the configuration of eQTL across tissues are derived from the adaptive thresholding of local false discovery rates, and maximum a posteriori estimation, respectively. We also provide theoretical justification of the adaptive procedure. We investigate the MT‐eQTL model through an extensive analysis of a 9‐tissue data set from the GTEx initiative.","inCitations":["43aa33c5a38f98a67aace6388f000d523d254333","55b8eceee4287a247cd271c8b32be61564e40889","8fe78e96aa38413169c6bc031e7bda869cc50e58","47e0eca9f722167c3ec1e9f0ad5d48c81e83d1f8","aaf91bfd9eccfd0942ee8be9e5fa8d0627ea77ab","7eed0f7f7b128413fdb78ad803c41e65e619715e","671c03c6b48885fb6ced53b76d2320cb05037b4f","59f3357605348b8c97256257aadae07861035aca","869ebeef9c9573034a6159cbbd6bdeb7e0f97a49","8229d7f58bab804a138e710a926a75aaefe7d807","bc99a606e0bfd203344c5ee7fe5b2d2a7fb8849c","98e53d3186bc5ee62e716254db3d18bfee8c2cb8","fdf5578b445cb5cbd29e798687616ad5e5d4ca2d","65127b33f7e256db0c9c7b7d3912a85d8f2fd574","5816e81bb0a91485a09fbfe392d764c132328b16","612d8b4a1ae9ced0d109c4275b02bbd280362853","abccc8a13ff7b923305dcfd872ad4e88138b134f","5d69f578ad46bf23dfb76902db30651e2ab684ab","4f66bf775803007d8795b4bdddcb2edc6c921880","30e6271a3bb60679e56fa95761579381bbef51c0","f31196124a9485030ced67a2ea768126e39406db","a941e8a6771d5967a12a0f3ec0a777e6e4a5bb3e","be0d06883aefa0e76e0b9cc0e574b3b5a0f83804"],"title":"An empirical Bayes approach for multiple tissue eQTL analysis","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx048"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2011,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"I have personally witnessed processing advance from desk calculators and mainframes, through timesharing and PCs, to supercomputers and cloud computing. I have also witnessed resources grow from too little data into almost too much data, and from theory dominating data into data beginning to dominate theory while needing new theory. Finally, I have witnessed problems advance from simple in a lone discipline into becoming almost too complex in multiple disciplines, as well as approaches evolve from analysis driving solutions into solutions by data mining beginning to drive the analysis itself. How we do all of this has transitioned from competition overcoming collaboration into collaboration starting to overcome competition, as well as what is done being more important than how it is done has transitioned into how it is done becoming as important as what is done. In addition, what or how we do it being more important than what or how we should actually do it has shifted into what or how we should do it becoming just as important as what or how we do it, if not more so. Although we have come a long way in both our methodology and technology, are they sufficient for our current or future complex and multidisciplinary problems with their massive databases? Since the apparent answer is not a resounding yes, we are presented with tremendous challenges and opportunities. This personal perspective adapts my background and experience to be appropriate for biopharmaceuticals. In these times of exploding change, informed perspectives on what challenges should be explored with accompanying guidance may be even more valuable than the far more typical literature reviews in conferences and journals of what has already been accomplished without challenges or guidance. Would we believe that an architect who designs a skyscraper determines the skyscraper's exact exterior, interior and furnishings or only general characteristics? Why not increase dependability of conclusions in genetics and translational medicine by enriching genetic determinism with uncertainty? Uncertainty is our friend if exploited or potential enemy if ignored. Genes design proteins, but they cannot operationally determine all protein characteristics: they begin a long chain of complex events occurring many times via intricate feedbacks plus interactions which are not all determined. Genes influence proteins and diseases by just determining their probability distributions, not by determining them. From any sample of diseased people, we may more successfully infer gene probability distributions than genes themselves, and it poses an issue to resolve.

In this article, we develop and implement a joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data using some powerful distributions for robust analyzing that are known as normal/independent distributions. These distributions include univariate and multivariate versions of the Student's t, the slash, and the contaminated normal distributions. The proposed model implements a linear mixed effects model under a normal/independent distribution assumption for both random effects and residuals of the longitudinal process. For the time-to-event process a parametric proportional hazard model with a Weibull baseline hazard is used. Also, a Bayesian approach using the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method is adopted for parameter estimation. Some simulation studies are performed to investigate the performance of the proposed method under presence and absence of outliers. Also, the proposed methods are applied for analyzing a real AIDS clinical trial, with the aim of comparing the efficiency and safety of two antiretroviral drugs, where CD4 count measurements are gathered as longitudinal outcomes. In these data, time to death or dropout is considered as the interesting time-to-event outcome variable. Different model structures are developed for analyzing these data sets, where model selection is performed by the deviance information criterion (DIC), expected Akaike information criterion (EAIC), and expected Bayesian information criterion (EBIC).","inCitations":["f99ffaaea665721d808cacdaf98c0ba49abd616e","78ddcfbd7f1e3733aa97627be91e9984a81dc03a","e303eea14833705a8a74633c656abdbdde86e2ff","c29ad17c747d904047e097dba848ec8ad5d3b41a","0b06d53efc31f447de49cd30d78d1903ef58860a","528bd801b1519cbf312acc1180826f3ce7b1fcdf","a47d0e267a238d64c4aecac84a803dc6b1ed5b2f","5aecd0302c44617cbd89329968fbfb5b9808aac5","8db154f1f024904d8eeaa4d618b6b1dd5d31a99d"],"title":"Bayesian joint modeling of longitudinal measurements and time-to-event data using robust distributions.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.903657"}
