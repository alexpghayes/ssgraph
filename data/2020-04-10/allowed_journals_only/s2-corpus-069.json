If the number of randomized clusters is small, there is a reasonable chance of baseline imbalance between the experimental and control groups. This imbalance threatens the validity of inferences regarding post-treatment intervention effects unless an appropriate statistical adjustment is used. Here, we consider application of the propensity score adjustment for cluster RCTs. For the purpose of illustration, we apply the propensity adjustment to a cluster RCT that evaluated an intervention to reduce suicidal ideation and depression. This approach to adjusting imbalance had considerable bearing on the interpretation of results. A simulation study demonstrates that the propensity adjustment reduced well over 90% of the bias seen in unadjusted models for the specifications examined.","inCitations":["8ac8bc0381323292def1118441a8410dd8cdcb6f","dbeea4b831e365d58c9fe7b9ce0a3d228695aa66","4cea565dd44956c59c302abe73847bec62b9e0f2","b2025554a2d323be36a8e405d079c53a26516eb7","3694fb60fd764735ba686dcd91d09e7213aa4b15"],"title":"Subject-level matching for imbalance in cluster randomized trials with a small number of clusters.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1580"}

One common design for assessing the accuracy of diagnostic tests involves multiple readers and multiple tests, in which all readers read all test results from the same patients. This design is most commonly used in a radiology setting, where the results of diagnostic tests depend on a radiologist's subjective interpretation. The most widely used approach for analyzing data from such a study is the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz (DBM) method (Dorfman et al., 1992) which utilizes a standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) model for the jackknife pseudovalues of the area under the ROC curves (AUCs). Although the DBM method has performed well in published simulation studies, there is no clear theoretical basis for this approach. In this paper, focusing on continuous outcomes, we investigate its theoretical basis. Our result indicates that the DBM method does not satisfy the regular assumptions for standard ANOVA models, and thus might lead to erroneous inference. We then propose a marginal model approach based on the AUCs which can adjust for covariates as well. Consistent and asymptotically normal estimators are derived for regression coefficients. We compare our approach with the DBM method via simulation and by an application to data from a breast cancer study. The simulation results show that both our method and the DBM method perform well when the accuracy of tests under the study is the same and that our method outperforms the DBM method for inference on individual AUCs when the accuracy of tests is not the same. The marginal model approach can be easily extended to ordinal outcomes.","inCitations":["a1f74f59e29fb0cbf94d69b7efee1dda652eb3af","fcfc460c881764cf7d7e7819432a6e01252e84cc","53f0cce172aec9fbbbf7443262dff9b31374dcb7","dec5963c12dfa9644a04f451cc09e885f68addf2","e332cac952ebb3258d7bd8b4285922eb9c00d7c5","af4383c09c18eaa675189e92ce6d598824631e57","cc8dac93d9d6aed55f803186d7439e7db5eff10b","21a2e49bdee0c461d856df254cf5118ebd4d2ce2"],"title":"A marginal model approach for analysis of multi-reader multi-test receiver operating characteristic (ROC) data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi011"}

To this end, scientists are undertaking large-scale genetic association studies that aim to identify genetic variants associated with molecular and cellular phenotypes, such as gene expression, transcription factor binding, or chromatin accessibility. These studies use high-throughput sequencing assays (e.g., RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq) to obtain high-resolution data on how the traits vary along the genome in each sample. However, typical association analyses fail to exploit these high-resolution measurements, instead aggregating the data at coarser resolutions, such as genes, or windows of fixed length. Here we develop and apply statistical methods that better exploit the high-resolution data. The key idea is to treat the sequence data as measuring an underlying \"function\" that varies along the genome, and then, building on wavelet-based methods for functional data analysis, test for association between genetic variants and the underlying function. Applying these methods to identify genetic variants associated with chromatin accessibility (dsQTLs), we find that they identify substantially more associations than a simpler window-based analysis, and in total we identify 772 novel dsQTLs not identified by the original analysis.","inCitations":["4f5c3827b87c9e983bcb2e292cf37ae93c4b4e9e","2f1beb332c7b11849964c3add629f5808f6f686e","80fd152033705a15873a5941ec5eaa43673487d2","3365987ea763dce54e7b25869416a18c4da369d2","01a8bac1256ec49c16f0e09f785a91aaf70c180e","03eec63d9edf842f921cc32e261d1e6ba155f1a4","d7893b35837519d7f3d7eebaf2d0105e2a8634d9","86867040d374f3bc4c82e025eddff37aef5919c2","2ad3400be7002758662060bf51eb61a763f840c1","eacdd1adc45f6307195cbb6af7a640cdc9572fc6","e9b2730238789960af3667ce9924debdaa28f630","53680c20e710b67507281ad00862f8d17f8e8576"],"title":"Wavelet-based Genetic Association Analysis of Functional Phenotypes Arising from High-throughput Sequencing Assays.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS776"}

The Cox regression model is commonly used to adjust for relevant covariates to obtain more accurate estimates of the hazard ratio between treatment groups. However, it is well known that the treatment hazard ratio based on a covariate-adjusted Cox regression model is conditional on the specific covariates and differs from the unconditional hazard ratio that is an average across the population. Therefore, covariate-adjusted Cox models cannot be used when the unconditional inference is desired. In addition, the covariate-adjusted Cox model requires the relatively strong assumption of proportional hazards for each covariate. To overcome these challenges, a nonparametric randomization-based analysis of covariance method was proposed to estimate the covariate-adjusted hazard ratios for multivariate time-to-event outcomes. However, empirical evaluations of the performance (power and type I error rate) of the method have not been studied. Although the method is derived for multivariate situations, for most registration trials, the primary endpoint is a univariate outcome. Therefore, this approach is applied to univariate outcomes, and performance is evaluated through a simulation study in this paper. Stratified analysis is also investigated. As an illustration of the method, we also apply the covariate-adjusted and unadjusted analyses to an oncology trial.","inCitations":["ad380b58929260c3bd1fe0a66128524ff05161a7","b17c8a3ed0ace613f86a3c574d72894790f1b83a"],"title":"Nonparametric covariate adjustment in estimating hazard ratios.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1725"}

In the motivating application the stimulus is an air pollutant such as airborne particulate matter and the response is mortality. However, several other variables (e.g. daily temperature) impact the response in a possibly non-linear fashion. To quantify the effect of the stimulus in the presence of covariate data we combine two established regression techniques: generalized additive models and distributed lag models. Generalized additive models extend multiple linear regression by allowing for continuous covariates to be modeled as smooth, but otherwise unspecified, functions. Distributed lag models aim to relate the outcome variable to lagged values of a time-dependent predictor in a parsimonious fashion. The resultant, which we call generalized additive distributed lag models, are seen to effectively quantify the so-called 'mortality displacement effect' in environmental epidemiology, as illustrated through air pollution/mortality data from Milan, Italy.","inCitations":["05846d4941196ad1b34159e9608098809b3288bb","a80c76dc21f755b8c85dfadf967c56940b573956","ad735d0cdc976b784096df0dc661b8f892bf5299","0d5e94164270b746b3e4a3f8880a5f37b5487b8f","2e3676b62c1187a5d15c6cf6f54adfb0d923eca2","939ef46da8454f7074ab62b0a63127157cf12bc1","be74d9648bf038b83067bd8bd340918fa46e0a78","094e0288f663ab0a2d31bfa33e7aa69fd7e44cbf","47ea78548d587bc9dba0ee684c9e2221d3e7173c","c31274da54539d444d152ae7db56e9490f528d97","5e799b24d76e872d9eef45fed679cead57938857","57c9af15eab6d5f6a9dc7f525404d8404e603c4e","071a4f93348d02d770d841b849f4ecca81726f29","649e4cda9ca1f072a303e6ae67d6fa1f2ae26486","a4b7b2bab69c1fcf5d131e14ae80b73ae20924a9","1a3a6696b26ea8bde334b5b2611b179d7c3325fc","da030e57b186fc870eab92c4f1ac6be717ede6da","294e46fa1c480e03ce267f93b43362ca168c8e53","311411e1c413f3c85effa97471fc976911707ece","cb4af36a7a199b143b63e44b157ac4d1dd139149","b1c754f37436a9b5550dc2318a5852048981840e","f65126eb67d630bf0156bbbc801c6f1244312144","48f8d93a4c71698ba682d155893cd31b29bb195b","846fbd1594368f0c2f4d9a5a077ec1c3921ad04f","7e5512273c9049b4ba816295925dd323bac5ffb9","791a43f031cadbda0b2991782cb388f7d09b0555","e7ff43cee645e0b45fc585ecd98c9d009cfd5b46","0f07c59580fd1b97f376053ece727b2f5584710b","ea2be75ac2fada8223c54d793cd54d1a65695a6c","d2467fcb72adad38609900bdb82c00859c14f351","b42a3158ca6741eb4e68e656954a702f2ce27446","d126aaf4e20baeb98ffd03b0515d43afe29e8aec","b8edf4e46ea82164945c3dc10502e499ece65eea","cdcf678b6040b90420c09a298418f7601ed45588","66f9452759e77f75a17ba73c0ac4dc58e75a021b","7a1bba9ea14e721b28ac1f514f57fc7684bc97f3","b9a7e30d51a02d837cf7af26a740c92fb1f27973","3c5e9a49173fabda129458aafad28b86ae8c0dc9","0297e882ea95083fbd75a49ef893d7e6c9146cce","68034e812be7c0994de0238fa6d22b79e301169f","13a1e3e4d5d69b6c981b9c2b037585de28f03b0a","66d4693f9b17e14c5272c58b9c623ddb6aa87bc9","957015e03bcf8f0b51173f2499980d9d64477067","f34a8035f74e3eb3e397387bf81aaa1071df06d6","70279ba1227307d4218133f1d81a2d30d917240e","1fb2c365c919f0d56454e6916b4c278377292528","6526a94d1002785113b9d5283e7c5df38fc918b7","fdd33040ec32e066764b11989981e70df1e832c6","c237053511beeb34e915547bc12fb7651df93e4c","783352c045428edb1d4cabd28039db2ec723fa4f","9da87a441d043e501752d5b76d522ecca9d95e24","cd87d189e7d597a7392700eb616934a8144fadc2","500c8b029f005ae7f86da19b31427a5538582403","9f7134821b7b0797b16e33d14507654356c11c4e","30ae4005b02a9ed8d808b3f690177d1bff2c3d0b","c9af02b3fa60edf45aeebb81278716e0201d5c29","31fb4a3f4ef194d63780ea0f1768d6d01e7cdab1","fed59ed9c634a135e98b9e4bfede63800a7eb1e9","c2898ab96de044a7b6a6f147b02abd2ca00e3b82","cfb307cdb003c1efc46571e278bfa243e8634c55","8e1f13691dfdb95e3da4314065eb72bf53c8c40b","d561dc40adc5734d33c54a35e3e5d897795edc63","318f5aa994d44b08e565cf4498723098db51b764","957e1b0aee3586f28d36543222a9b4ca97de6df8","1bcb7abb1b3ae0117e319db6fe7cbb89efa0fa4e","5b2462d8f91b7eaf90851fc79883691110e70a2f","ccb10c1c40c9f87de72c6a0563e7f73dae5b3d40","e6b31e6ca946e5b8c30ee32fc78c6c9d6b33756e","7aeabe2ceed14c01eb206d58312bd12cbf31c7e7","590ffc860f1e4f0372242949a6218d96b62982b5","2f9c257c85d86f8e0a9201fee9d484650571b91f","19b37fc9ad8eb3ce81230e9587183998b56ab969","1d945ab5a62be14498d8493502b971141489744e","cd3ce1b32187da9313bde8e801f6e70fc5cfe70d","c834a3e63f001938cf8b6ab4c9f403cc72f68a41","2066289e418f4258e82d6283092a54ed3903adb8","b16fac6e64898db4acc0b3fdf3284c57fc60dfc9","6eeece9dda0a397d3c8a1ba72b93552d3139819a","8fbadfc82d2d92273bc88aa326b93b80a14c0d72","0844dd000bb5946d79dafb69b09afb058dcdc81c","24ce7d8748d775936c0e30b9d15aa3c8909c6cf9","14553717df6ed8f962e9bea7d155f61ffc55411a","142569343f921fd5befda4370e64c26e1f4cf402","b2e652dbd3aad8ad1e75f60253ec6f9aaf09a66e","d937c9c2a45075dbd00f41692490b0bfd08fd4a8","c6795ba2b2cf49dd43d5c71f7453c0c11c8e4c29","ee9ae5a0503d26eeda03a3e1c146f545b87376b0","b9434ebbc3a6d3026c658d674763603df4c5542b","0f8c0af15f7dc1d8521c176a8d8f90c87cc4c534","9bd115b0aedf1dc3864344c4116401faa141ac5b","066f4723433cf2b39fbbcdd3dd4143942c0beca5","0f3283467a68bb835a3b30679d57acced10d08d8","549fd2b7110141b1d45ba8e4de8d819aafafd2b9","317380bead270cb5be9b7a1ae60b8b764c920d51","3b76bffb915e5070f20772ee507820526903907d","615ebd0c08193b8c9f70cc4d561f4c0b1d08518f","194221653d1ac4658e8ee7c9c422bace5e0d3af7","936cb168519e34457c6fa5452aed8a42b3cc5964","ecd25b1ef9f434991f40fc47f3bf0586e5a7be13","e31488b0fb6293751f5b02fc822e78664e09fa68","fe622b1dc3c22669a3de4917fa9e1e13717a4f33","d82a19f93c4aaa92df09f30308555fde997a7282","7e071cf8b0d33110eda257a0158136899ddb0c03","008b936987c4067a366547f159870c544c22850a","747099f98a81d2a0159c3da95223fdd9958b08fe","cf427d213b553fd5b17e368f8bf442abf63f43b2","e5d06791cf9857f44eece2bd58ae1cfffcb5b3d0","264ec2c85c90f9080b5e6b0c4b767b72082f46bc","cc6fa5bf291eaebac47b431a4efe7ff5f93a45e7","77dd5b2093c61b2d5f059abbe0ceb966cbda6840","52014d56549aa0fb53b201929e992c40de0a39e6","c23b9c1945b33c724ab609c6fb35b0c75cfe76ae","494d9bd945d66f064cc48d8b8184983665e70c94","8ecd41b6a63986b43d25f31f7716583df5ae59b3","a75ffe3f42f10338a29313b1fc49c2a178d235bf","96559a2d19867b173834847a8085efa

The algorithm is conceptually appealing and makes assumptions neither about the shape of the clusters nor about their number. However, with a complexity of O(n2) per iteration, it does not scale well to large data sets. We propose a novel algorithm which performs density-based clustering much quicker than mean-shift, yet delivering virtually identical results. This algorithm combines subsampling and a stochastic approximation procedure to achieve a potential complexity of O(n) at each step. Its convergence is established. Its performances are evaluated using simulations and applications to image segmentation, where the algorithm was tens or hundreds of times faster than mean-shift, yet causing negligible amounts of clustering errors. The algorithm can be combined with existing approaches to further accelerate clustering.","inCitations":["3f09d7b4c07fe41df608aa1d1589c043638c015c"],"title":"Fast Nonparametric Density-Based Clustering of Large Data Sets Using a Stochastic Approximation Mean-Shift Algorithm.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2015.1051625"}

We provide a general likelihood-based framework for making inference on genetic effects and gene-environment interactions with such missing data. We allow genetic and environmental variables to be correlated while leaving the distribution of environmental variables completely unspecified. We consider 3 major study designs-cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort designs-and construct appropriate likelihood functions for all common phenotypes (e.g. case-control status, quantitative traits, and potentially censored ages at onset of disease). The likelihood functions involve both finite- and infinite-dimensional parameters. The maximum likelihood estimators are shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal, and asymptotically efficient. Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms are developed to implement the corresponding inference procedures. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed inferential and numerical methods perform well in practical settings.

When potential confounding exists, a multilevel model yields better power to assess the independent effects of each predictor by gathering evidence across many sub-studies. If the predictors are measured with unknown error, bias can be expected in the individual substudies, and in the combined estimates of the second-stage model. We consider two alternative methods for estimating the independent effects of two predictors in a hierarchical model. We show both analytically and via simulation that one of these gives essentially unbiased estimates even in the presence of measurement error, at the price of a moderate reduction in power. The second avoids the potential for upward bias, at the price of a smaller reduction in power. Since measurement error is endemic in epidemiology, these approaches hold considerable potential. We illustrate the two methods by applying them to two air pollution studies. In the first, we re-analyze published data to show that the estimated effect of fine particles on daily deaths, independent of coarse particles, was downwardly biased by measurement error in the original analysis. The estimated effect of coarse particles becomes more protective using the new estimates. In the second example, we use published data on the association between airborne particles and daily deaths in 10 US cities to estimate the effect of gaseous air pollutants on daily deaths. The resulting effect size estimates were very small and the confidence intervals included zero.","inCitations":["aa2026cb22c484707d312a9a3a44005a3df7879a","db5b57b9164d1fe1ebd52f506b36a06e1ebbe363","6a2a95f46cb2a08a096c92ede086da8f7b46c988","8be06de5e7b0c87b6673f9ed1e925a1558d0ded9","c6b149b70c368c61f7f4a9075c3929e4398cacd5","3bf3eed10a50da1fd42cf5ebd74a906757c3af61","03c8b677da22efd3e5e9614be3dd71d392c14cf2","c7e8c35e380223173ace70b778431178637fd20f","845062e7555846723def2bcdce0431903d4ecfd5","8ec31ffcb0f07c654b1de1f78c0a1d2bb8e21ae8","bf03f249a816ce5c9e5443e8d268c79a9eeae0f7","6dbf54fc141d3f51f4749217629baeb738bf3d4d","cd3ce1b32187da9313bde8e801f6e70fc5cfe70d","0c2f49a240b096a324831ce64f411366623fb6fa","57ba777eac646664865a8d16fe5b00b6b56cf9b3","b8b1d5b85a7d2b1a9ab2dfdec6249e2b5a226f79","f7f63a1fde6936d8092f1f9f7afda7e52b21dd68","fadfc32f39fb15f75d7291b2135b57a74ee5ad06","fd4274531baa6c17c62b4c6a48669084adbd7450","4cc9777a857ab92f2e9c57f1917c0c42a15eb902","72d11cc14466e7d94614a078a4959f248461a03b","1de694f82edf2d85d181baea8b37bcf895178b52","117760e31572cf556a5d3df585e1ba0165c0418b","1613d0dca895d69ccac17360812f130187de5437","b668acfe9fddaba6231be4c4ec261638084315a8","d8387a6deadcad979152a705715d6638485a25be","13b4460d174ec515cf16437faa6552763440fc21"],"title":"Control for confounding in the presence of measurement error in hierarchical models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.4.539"}

In the presence of stratum effects, the van Elteren (vE) test, a stratified WMW test, can be used to adjust for the stratum effect. We provide guidance on how to choose between the two tests in the design phase of clinical trials and in the analysis of clinical data. We show by simulations that both tests preserve the type I error rate regardless of the presence of the stratum effects. Therefore, the test with greater power is preferred. In comparing powers, we found that the WMW test is better when the stratum effects are small, whereas the vE test is better when the stratum effects are large. Finally, when the stratum effects are moderate, the decision depends on the shape of the distribution and the ratio of the number of strata and the number of subjects. In this case, results presented in this article or from similar simulations may be used to determine which test is better.","inCitations":["45e523f02e73eb034b6859a994001b14a657d52d","d2f5f191ce8e1ea1c94016bb40831f0bd1c098f2","aeb5adea6abc2c6e38ed2c760fbedfad007276eb","eb0960c6f5d812a58a0910ea21e16700a976fafb","a4bcddb44d75f51e0e40e544da1e032ee4a0e966","f44c2ebb42bfc9b2321c2a852dfa415b2d07020b","f9ecfcf9b7c16591977058c73a7c4a54394049be","70bd9a5fdfda537f50ee0f071689f1a7bd9760eb","a36f88a88352490bfa6c37e73b5bfcc100e9e105","ade36fc79eb11294cbeba703ba6a5fbabad490a4","8c478757a61412a3e5e0f1972d2cf16f1f1b49cf"],"title":"Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test: stratify or not?","doi":"10.1080/10543400802369103"}

Epidemic models are used to predict the spread of emergent pathogens and compare intervention strategies. Many of these models assume equal probability of contact within mixing groups (homes, schools, etc.), but little work has inferred the actual contact network, which may influence epidemic estimates. We develop a penalized likelihood method to infer contact networks within households, a key area for disease transmission. Using egocentric surveys of contact behavior in Belgium, we estimate within-household contact networks for six different age compositions. Our estimates show dependency in contact behavior and vary substantively by age composition, with fewer contacts occurring in older households. Our results are relevant for epidemic models used to make policy recommendations.","inCitations":["a4f3dfeb7e52ce88ebe33378eb7e9064510cdb94","ab704988a75f5f8ea6e9b632fe7f1918f24edf0d","31e3079b37ec6f17fa16955c5476f2ee77153885","7190867805eda743817fdb71bc44165cc5d72485"],"title":"A penalized likelihood approach to estimate within-household contact networks from egocentric data.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12011"}

Powerful statistical methods are critical to accomplishing this goal. A popular method is the omnibus Pearson's chi-square test applied to genotype counts. To achieve increased power, tests based on an assumed trait model have been proposed. However, they are not robust to model misspecification. Much research has been carried out on enhancing robustness of such model-based tests. An analysis framework that tests the equality of allele frequency while allowing for different deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) between cases and controls is proposed. The proposed method does not require specification of trait models nor HWE. It involves only 1 degree of freedom. The likelihood ratio statistic, score statistic, and Wald statistic associated with this framework are introduced. Their performance is evaluated by extensive computer simulation in comparison with existing methods.","inCitations":["2126e740b870cd3689e933f0a4c95bc46f3d6d50","b4468e83c4fed2a978ff38d991ecb8d8d321a4fb","d77b73e2304b597d26348c1b483e9f55da12385d","7024c574297580f26d8ad8294a3946331d8f3024","0f8599427ed8d14db25e80c9de5c4a97012dcfc8","fb7422cf533be1ce153fb5d0b19970f7515455a2","3469940c61fd43b96441905dd6e3b88d28cb0824"],"title":"Statistical tests of genetic association for case-control study designs.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs002"}

Compared to the mean difference, the generalized treatment effect has many advantages; for example, it is a scaleless measure and it does not change under monotonic transformations. This article investigates the problem of testing equality of generalized treatment effects among several clinical trials. The proposed approach follows the same vein as the generalized variable method for testing equality of several log-normal means proposed by Li (2009). Numerical study demonstrates that the proposed test has excellent type I error control for clinical trials with small to medium sample sizes. Robustness study shows that the proposed method performs reasonably for categorical data.","inCitations":["3e26977575309cf4f8247f0173a8ac2e8e17da13"],"title":"Testing equality of generalized treatment effects.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.564339"}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an example of a multi-state disease process in which great interest lies in identifying risk factors for transition. In this context, non-homogeneous models are required because transition rates change as subjects age. In this report we propose a non-homogeneous Markov regression model that allows for reversible and recurrent disease states, transitions among multiple states between observations, and unequally spaced observation times. We conducted simulation studies to demonstrate performance of estimators for covariate effects from this model and compare performance with alternative models when the underlying non-homogeneous process was correctly specified and under model misspecification. In simulation studies, we found that covariate effects were biased if non-homogeneity of the disease process was not accounted for. However, estimates from non-homogeneous models were robust to misspecification of the form of the non-homogeneity. We used our model to estimate risk factors for transition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in a longitudinal study of subjects included in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set. Using our model, we found that subjects with MCI affecting multiple cognitive domains were significantly less likely to revert to normal cognition.","inCitations":["c50861f9ecfc2814befea186903e50fdd63b6edc","5256c264d42f4e3cbecc0975c9b7b5f0cde0618e","16288b2d0f70d8359dab7fa7ae0b3bbf208a5d4c","2dabd1a2b108a762cb694ed8d6b9d3e1786cd400","c2dfc87ccddd73567c416aefdf4e4abbda1568ab"],"title":"A comparison of non-homogeneous Markov regression models with application to Alzheimer's disease progression.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2010.547567"}

The EBA of anti-TB drugs has conventionally been calculated as the rate of decline in colony forming unit (CFU) count during the first 14 days of treatment. The measurement of CFU count, however, is expensive and prone to contamination. Alternatively to CFU count, time to positivity (TTP), which is a potential biomarker for long-term efficacy of anti-TB drugs, can be used to characterize EBA. The current Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) regression model for TTP data, however, lacks robustness to gross outliers that often are present in the data. The conventional way of handling such outliers involves their identification by visual inspection and subsequent exclusion from the analysis. However, this process can be questioned because of its subjective nature. For this reason, we fitted robust versions of the Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects regression model to a wide range of TTP datasets. The performance of the explored models was assessed through model comparison statistics and a simulation study. We conclude that fitting a robust model to TTP data obviates the need for explicit identification and subsequent \"deletion\" of outliers but ensures that gross outliers exert no undue influence on model fits. We recommend that the current practice of fitting conventional normal theory models be abandoned in favor of fitting robust models to TTP data.","inCitations":["96873448da78fb1adad51ae02868790cb03b96a1"],"title":"Robust Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects modeling of time to positivity in tuberculosis trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1877"}

This method extends the Fine-Gray proportional hazards model for the subdistribution to situations, where individuals within a cluster may be correlated due to unobserved shared factors. Estimators of the regression parameters in the marginal model are developed under an independence working assumption where the correlation across individuals within a cluster is completely unspecified. The estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and variance estimation may be achieved without specifying the form of the dependence across individuals. A simulation study evidences that the inferential procedures perform well with realistic sample sizes.

Both simulations and real data applications show that ssCCA performs better than the standard sparse CCA in identifying meaningful variables when there are structures in the data.","inCitations":["447af6a82db19801cc6a40db87eb15b3c0da2f26","ea4a584ad6779ac78445cceae0220bbadaca2d2b","09681d6e66919dfb1e845d2006b59c88b8d1f359","eba0ee6c0f536a883b4948d75c54fc08eaee3633","0e9f182f8c7c531f96961e4bef4274dd3ab06264","b40a18575c08a1d76c028e45f9e5a9fa844ac914","9bea9c8121a51e468aae72dee0f413991d13782f","666948f40788bd277f8830d0f679b679ea979c47","526bbcf5e47530f2e2ecd43db5f6fa054f96c9ca","c616e4ed59a41077da5a4fb965789cb35ab727c7","56a221c276bb2ff4f69b2c5b58aeeab78b510186","8811a0313a972d94a385ca32488e012935ff3d6d","2f35c5354c8f639377b9014f3df4240cbfb75fc9","653b6f7c814b3f29fe048796f40e5fdadc2fd4b2","f8ea0f76f2044168040fcd0a9e81072c88cde4a4","68d61d5673a1ecbe3e40a49797a9bdfd0b418fcd","842d62c514db492ffcbdbfe4d3fcf06da7d91396","66593f9b5fed7037ab1a216246fbd4e8ae74addb","26f6c01a60ae0e494e45f5bc187be76996cb79c4","8f9df7df1629bdb9a6a830b6772450a7a5c022c4","2704db65f5396b65ea4796ef0a14f98603442675","30164f63203a0805716c8fc70f65a24cbd32532e","472625eec0970ed63260f1c5de31144df8cdd981","38d527685a0d1fd0a4a286b13dc7e0adbe144cd7","ad967a0cc7ae017805ba578039beb7c0b65d6044","edeb7e2b20cecac3459f8ad61a9b09ba1499549a","aff1b345d3658bdf4fbccf15870c4f8900a21fc6","4eaf7d85ef7872d89a6acd29282319114108bbdc","4c9f7fe4376f215011af32f046aabba98dc55d73","73e3609a8b44e2641786490b5ffd978fb88313af","e5d7dc75455556785f6a2745d114bcd4845c325f","69aa4c01889cf1d2372db1b2880705a6c29249d6","b3a4588b9c5ecd3dfbdfe079676237732e6a2a2f","ee6a58d630158e863badf6e737e7552e2e594e9a","07085ab2c726111df1d864ac05b9a8174f409a41","f0023c8c47014745127f13aee0ce2e494482cb06","acee9787e8af5c5b9eef403f9250918b53f15000","5339a74071bb7c01e3ba6095ba0782e2d5a62a27","26c16c7a245294398cabbe331180c9709ab57e1d","26f23422fdef0fbfd423f79aeab6a355b747da8f","9fcd41020df7f9c7fdf99e3c2e9812c09fb64737","7953e9ad29893cf8320134a4567e5382f1545a3d","789a954a705816c0e01e22f70e32b54428e08ab1","5d6939fd731649dfcd33fbfa18fe964e4621ac68","78263677a46f2829384b86e4c5d979ea4e2dc9b2","152f2a8780fe03a323b2f1e05df7377c406a5232","8693124df57c4a8db27dc8df89234d824f348642","7ba477c85985468013a7e2193bb236a9ee3c7e92","6ee81a6df45524c5d6988c08e1d963ee48eed16d","aa50e40bb21fbbd645303974eb84e320aa150104","fe353ba9419c6c3f77901eae986b94e945712c07","7c87ec9e74fd9f099aa2143773f34a052cf0e890","50aeb2d1c34d62d08ef2fd6f2519dffc44447c2b","bb85bd0dbf209864b3bcfda158fdf9000a375962","63894e9b4a2a58b41aefaae214e1656ceed61da8","b1f58a69765e83f3200577834597f44975efbf87","053d138b5660617b396e78339cdd9f219e3928cf","245fe908ab4279c9bb484f2ebd577ac71ee8354f","c586fba023dbaeda8a585eccb546ce906eeb1d19","d708571991b4dcf16909e8de51aa9b4c8fa26984","c0e691074e12483027aab2b25a0e41022d8d4abf","357e680f577f757a15261b8c67aad598d0d0cbcf"],"title":"Structure-constrained sparse canonical correlation analysis with an application to microbiome data analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs038"}

Fine and Gray proposed a proportional hazards regression model for the subdistribution of a competing risk with the assumption that the censoring distribution and the covariates are independent. Covariate-dependent censoring sometimes occurs in medical studies. In this paper, we study the proportional hazards regression model for the subdistribution of a competing risk with proper adjustments for covariate-dependent censoring. We consider a covariate-adjusted weight function by fitting the Cox model for the censoring distribution and using the predictive probability for each individual. Our simulation study shows that the covariate-adjusted weight estimator is basically unbiased when the censoring time depends on the covariates, and the covariate-adjusted weight approach works well for the variance estimator as well. We illustrate our methods with bone marrow transplant data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). Here cancer relapse and death in complete remission are two competing risks.","inCitations":["4f4751d39ab509a6774c91373c5c06e88a547cc4","778271d7d61dd97a0a6bec515a25b38792228c4c","0c69ebbea8941f8066a0295b524105edea16514f","a282614e057c38534bf8e0d888d17292e72cf099"],"title":"A Proportional Hazards Regression Model for the Sub-distribution with Covariates Adjusted Censoring Weight for Competing Risks Data.","doi":"10.1111/sjos.12167"}

The output of the LC-MS system measures the intensity of a peptide with a specific mass-charge ratio and retention time. In the last few years, this technology has been used to compare complex biological samples across multiple conditions. One challenge for comparative proteomic profiling with LC-MS is to match corresponding peptide features from different experiments. In this paper, we propose a new method--Peptide Element Alignment (PETAL) that uses raw spectrum data and detected peak to simultaneously align features from multiple LC-MS experiments. PETAL creates spectrum elements, each of which represents the mass spectrum of a single peptide in a single scan. Peptides detected in different LC-MS data are aligned if they can be represented by the same elements. By considering each peptide separately, PETAL enjoys greater flexibility than time warping methods. While most existing methods process multiple data sets by sequentially aligning each data set to an arbitrarily chosen template data set, PETAL treats all experiments symmetrically and can analyze all experiments simultaneously. We illustrate the performance of PETAL on example data sets.","inCitations":["d6f6a2618178a24ee437c8b2ad6d8b809184f077","51adbeeb7a8893dc7ccc68819fbcde2b154e175d","5b331a5b0176494da6ffe07cdddf7f82a2c94624","e29ad262295be717b590ab4e180dd92ecb5d9b84","52c5b962292c2b9deb84f68069cbb51420ec4338","364410e550339c402e317780808270a643de9daf","b8855ca061b3d32c6fee61a587e18171434515fa","85df7b36a3d347f852adf15a317009d609b996eb","8a5eae38e6001bdd5821e3b960d5ad3f6700c737","bde3d964239d19b68c20f81309bd815f1c2473e1","848775953b24e0bc9ba0d71e7eee21f1776de695","187f9e8771bff76d412510a24a1e492b4d4ce6d7","11e4116c9de619f0c82a0346a1989a9411a2aa3c","69c86dd613b3dd67ff5405c54612a782a3caa61c","a597ffe3c2adc6b3abb392129cdac8a81071a519","6758c845b1775dece552370187e55386f2436aa0","5040521bd6f34058af7162dc89df3aae67d4286f","b508f7155dabde059ed48038f923d06d339659d0","0a0cf415cef629edaa6ce4742e6d8a3667666b7b","29438e3638714410434662df8de6843b4458d886","473ab77eb62b88b32cc307bd007119d574636912","ecbff17c5f12c8727a2db60c8db4873c11377109","7381494c71f6694b38a33400bf08a4788c99f956","aa07952f872fc0b8f65be59bc41cf45e0714e73b","400be499c8a224c93b7ae9c67e91c3ad3f85d328","c4c86c2d948cc90a665c63db7ceca36176e2616f","0869921f144c0aa1efb1746203089827ec11fa6e","563ae8cd335856ff18f11632c1f2abc091845fe8","2636594e1fd6b928af59b4fbc6b6a81eb9b93e8d","48816ba1fba0f86dca8fa3840756a8051f63f070","bd31763025dc49128c5562fd0f018373f46dde26","2b25d0311378ee971c29068ddde30e50d26f162e","26f6e4f7b43d914dede8ab7fa3c5a07a987fe3a2","1820e9b8494aacc0de62e2b596033d75492bc917","8be7adcbe7c8e29a3ce087c52d88c4fb62564064","bae13d65062d18c3d3be01a7eba73807bc0a957d","a970225d7ba215fcc7e150ddcaccdaa019f44390","3893448ec19a075d1f894871545b069c7c3e826c","ff3918e09bf0369492ac5201404f6ad1754d13ba","3ec5bbf97978397bf359430b44d49c4550d79c27","e84418ad221abff9c3d89727c2fa15b14b48bd47","889816da47716a2a5c1cbf842f82136147080ae5","e2c0ec9ecac2d3eb69c2f53ca3791d9da9044124"],"title":"A statistical method for chromatographic alignment of LC-MS data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl015"}

The two hypotheses may be tested sequentially or simultaneously. Depending on the structure of the hypotheses to be tested and the understanding of type I error rate control, various scenarios of type I error rate adjustments may be applied. Furthermore, for the objective of getting approval from regional authorities for different primary endpoints, various sample size and power determinations may be applied.
