The accuracy of a continuous-scale test at a chosen cut-off level can be measured by its sensitivity and specificity, i.e. by the probabilities that the test correctly identifies the diseased and non-diseased subjects, respectively.In practice, sensitivity and specificity of the test are unknown. Moreover, which cut-off level to use is also generally unknown in that no preliminary indications driving its choice could be available.In this paper, we address the problem of making joint inference on pairs of quantities defining accuracy of a diagnostic test, in particular, when one of the two quantities is the cut-off level. We propose a technique based on an empirical likelihood statistic that allows, within a unified framework, to build bivariate confidence regions for the pair (sensitivity, cut-off level) at a fixed value of specificity as well as for the pair (specificity, cut-off level) at a fixed value of sensitivity or the pair (sensitivity, specificity) at a fixed cut-off value.A simulation study is carried out to assess the finite-sample accuracy of the method. Moreover, we apply the method to two real examples.","inCitations":["4becd5244622a0a845a0e5f618ccc7d603e800c4","927bae61be2af235021ef8830dbd580bae8d4b24","19a1be5112fcf44f1f24cb31483b45c38136e865"],"title":"Simple Nonparametric Confidence Regions for the Evaluation of Continuous-Scale Diagnostic Tests","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1256"}

However, in practice, the resulting approximations degrade as parameter values move away from the value used to define the Markov chain, even in cases where the chain produces perfectly efficient samples. We introduce a new approximation method along with a novel method of moving toward a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) from an arbitrary starting parameter value in a series of steps based on alternating between the canonical exponential family parameterization and the mean-value parameterization. This technique enables us to find an approximate MLE in many cases where this was previously not possible. We illustrate these methods on a model for a transcriptional regulation network for E. coli, an example where previous attempts to approximate an MLE had failed, and a model for a well-known social network dataset involving friendships among workers in a tailor shop. These methods are implemented in the publicly available ergm package for R, and computer code to duplicate the results of this paper is included in the Supplemental Materials.","inCitations":["6c00a7daf000d15301f399f384f1ccdd3d73ff26","32185f053c7e66f1129c92a3c3059c98343cff9b","1df15644775d758b35908a16a1058e89fffd10f2","363d346169087b3dd098685c18d5b74fe8e2afe3","0c343cf2363c73379ead037b003a3fbc42490b1d","b152102f2161b3036c3df4512309c47ee1cf1e0a","ca0e12dff536f3260668323f1dcd2cd9e6cc53c9","5f1fc094430876864987055d72f51ff27e517497","39f10235bee4c82f5e148ff5ab239d6af7c250e9","7fe8d68ae9cb492c4048cccaf318f3ca15927215","2b13230a65dcffd1827d64b61f68e4e50825a3c0","06498349d44382f5d9072876049e1531d9855329","613735c75d6f2cb12e1a4a7739f17f3c88eff72b","1110abe1b90a3d49b79b90d31fda74924e658953","32a70ebf6ef598c1629a71a48721547dc7d6a24a","7ae03757b7902630fc77b5502a3825dbff1b30e9","9de873633a63854022117e760dd89354ec82d29f","245eda98afe2d9a7bd94ad8da6ef3150ab6ce306","31d40e686b96b147d600b1c7a4d514d1a86200df","d6e82a19ae4e318a9b752c03de34a78315747e80","7f4c4932f649ba5bf9294cd43cc3c4085c22d5fc","4701f2f4873a19081655b3d4d7e65d37bfffc414","18d4ed052a973a5babe0a54fa0f8003ac550c380"],"title":"Improving Simulation-Based Algorithms for Fitting ERGMs.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2012.679224"}

The groups involve varying cluster sizes, and the binary responses within each cluster cannot be assumed independently. Three major measures of association used to report the efficacy of treatments or effectiveness of public health intervention programs in case of prospective studies are Risk Difference (RD), Risk Ratio (RR) and Relative Risk Difference (RED). The preference of one measure of association over the other in drawing statistical inference depends on design of study. Lui (2004) discusses a number of methods of constructing confidence intervals for each of these measures. Specifically, Lui (2004) discusses four methods for RD, four methods for RR and three methods for RED. For the construction of confidence intervals for RD, Paul and Zaihra (2008) compare the four methods discussed by Lui (2004), using extensive simulations with a method based on an estimator of the variance of a ratio estimator by Cochran (1977) and a method based on a sandwich estimator of the variance of the regression estimator using the generalized estimating equations approach of Zeger and Liang (1986). Paul and Zaihra (2008) conclude that the method based on an estimate of the variance of a ratio estimator performs best overall. In this paper, we extend the two new methodologies introduced in Paul and Zaihra (2008) to confidence interval construction of the risk measures RR and RED. Extensive simulations show that the method based on an estimate of the variance of a ratio estimator performs best overall for constructing confidence interval for the other two risk measures RR and RED as well. This method involves a very simple variance expression which can be implemented with a very few computer codes. Therefore, it can be considered as an easily implementable alternative for all the three measures of association.","inCitations":["6b1519d27dce511627a5d509c934d520dfd4c5ff","23b6e379df909bc4d7ec737a762e95fb36dc140d"],"title":"Interval Estimation of Some Epidemiological Measures of Association","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1177"}

Our contribution is multiple: we propose an integrated model to perform joint segmentation, normalization, and calling for multiple array CGH profiles. This model shows great flexibility, especially in the modeling of the wave effect that gives a likelihood framework to approaches proposed by others. We propose a new dynamic programming algorithm for break point positioning, as well as a model selection criterion based on a modified bayesian information criterion proposed in the univariate case.

MAXSD is defined as the highest experimental dose with no significant increased safety effect relative to the placebo or control group. In safety assessment, the primary control of the false-negative error rate is more important than that of the false-positive rate. Therefore, we propose a multiple testing procedure for equivalence in the many-to-one design with a priori ordered contrasts (shifted control vs. dose), where the acceptable risk delta is defined in advance. Tests for shifted and ratio hypotheses are presented and discussed.","inCitations":["f6f07fb88986cca0cf13802d91be0e74b505b335","69541de392198285065d7677faaa4bb70bb842ca","cee9c7e21f16ac72904a247802f102b36e5984dc","819bcfeca33b23b363bf014e51c0a4280d7125d4","a0b55f21428cc546b76d65fa605d1df6ac12a06e","04f4c5224db0372f33967000f5ed80824673892f","e9b18618b3fac23b79af883f386bf002a73d256a","640808ffe0970c0231f1463fe4df9f64d69d9627","150311af979c1e58e83f7ce89eed85c9d0f53289"],"title":"Identifying the maximum safe dose: a multiple testing approach.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101010"}

With this data researchers are tackling problems ranging from the identification of 'cancer genes' to the formidable task of adding functional annotations to our rapidly growing gene databases. Specific research questions suggest patterns of gene expression that are interesting and informative: for instance, genes with large variance or groups of genes that are highly correlated. Cluster analysis and related techniques are proving to be very useful. However, such exploratory methods alone do not provide the opportunity to engage in statistical inference. Given the high dimensionality (thousands of genes) and small sample sizes (often <30) encountered in these datasets, an honest assessment of sampling variability is crucial and can prevent the over-interpretation of spurious results. We describe a statistical framework that encompasses many of the analytical goals in gene expression analysis; our framework is completely compatible with many of the current approaches and, in fact, can increase their utility. We propose the use of a deterministic rule, applied to the parameters of the gene expression distribution, to select a target subset of genes that are of biological interest. In addition to subset membership, the target subset can include information about relationships between genes, such as clustering. This target subset presents an interesting parameter that we can estimate by applying the rule to the sample statistics of microarray data. The parametric bootstrap, based on a multivariate normal model, is used to estimate the distribution of these estimated subsets and relevant summary measures of this sampling distribution are proposed. We focus on rules that operate on the mean and covariance. Using Bernstein's Inequality, we obtain consistency of the subset estimates, under the assumption that the sample size converges faster to infinity than the logarithm of the number of genes. We also provide a conservative sample size formula guaranteeing that the sample mean and sample covariance matrix are uniformly within a distance epsilon > 0 of the population mean and covariance. The practical performance of the method using a cluster-based subset rule is illustrated with a simulation study. The method is illustrated with an analysis of a publicly available leukemia data set.","inCitations":["5f843147a0020c49aedfd859e8950e422b764964","e28ba0fd6ea94bd56f277d3a89de8f47fd5d1943","515b9273c4b1a452955229e110156ea94b963f2e","9b15e5de4e76bf475073f80a10fff5bc1fb14fdd","b3cf74a55e835c73177573f6318a5fcf42bcfbfb","c256d02fd24fb29e1f7a56392559de6e1adfa9e7","087f63ed875e379b8d7333b75bb9988a94c7fed3","631522463bb778f975481450bcc0d94cd4025b70","313b71b374d568eb30fbba73febe4be670f26262","e9d3066e7a35eec74426f9d03cc34b6c58493b5b","37acf819deb24436558cea8c90d5afd8ed4ba75f","366e6ef7a621972c4bae01a84fec1351aa711c77","a72785354509ebf05d4cf8b138958208553c3ffc","d1747f8eb0b3fc7616c3f7dda3cbce27eb7936cd","0bfed52b57fbc39e2c1bb4eff802f6a5b3483220","7c362d12bad507d455a4aff24291b5c431e50559","88c16d834b68de0fef473b9481c76dbb8850ed5e","aba8c29309d9dc756b437dfc17b9693097a00711","1abf6947d2813a53cf39ebf0172eaaeec1e61d33","f134f78689c1eb105630a4c45de38dd9062b0a1b","b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c","962a4b5bc6e8c056fd9e300c01b1bf0e387c0cf4","5c19e98b9609bb6a9ed6ef3d3b61256c3c454297","09501e4e147c4a93675f30964e44eb8ec90001a7","c9564345796f8144879c65dff4ae1c4fec7cf90a","3dd849c081ef8af2fd249074e77ac96fdbbd8dfc","7502b4867587e8877375fd2d66af4a16b44547b5","44dae7eeda929741d16d722648ffa420260ba8e2","c757e89f396ef951c0c03b28249787dccc4e5814","9d06f6cfb725b21cebe569e967aa2211febb0cff","72abdf62805ce2cbfcb8e2f9c6d2517de5540efd","72d999b37470ca58c0e7b025060e32257f667e51","2d94fce9c920c68a2f0c737e922be1554970cce0","5cee444c72e6b776f989ccd298b0005cf443c1ee","79c39981749c817cccdafb841b8fc72d76b3ffe5","ebcd61e7e06e0a3d84ec2c31b8d27ca4e1be7594","1a0d32f062b734429081312c028936627987b7e6","30afad712037a1380e88a682e88e1a345b7ec9dc","2cd118bc20bfc7b30c069a22e2c6a2a402beb6dc","1c4c4ee8e0699acebc49e72db83030e313acb754","25ef991d3bbb48d9808af36c924f7343f3832012","b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74","d543992aaca25731d9d5297deee3b079c26ae616","918f6216cf0c7e95825737fdef804cba610d0785","1b78afd060070bf0d0ddd19514f8ea913d3575af","0f92aaa6387342b3ecd9714e7ac3226d882e3274","8912df65a21a260022775772440797e45df8e6cc"],"title":"Gene expression analysis with the parametric bootstrap.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/2.4.445"}

The predominant method for statistical evaluation and interpretation of safety data collected in a clinical trial is the tabular display of descriptive statistics. There is a great opportunity to enhance evaluation of drug safety through the use of graphical displays, which can convey multiple pieces of information concisely and more effectively than can tables. Graphs can be used in an exploratory setting to help identify emerging safety signals, or in a confirmatory setting as a tool to elucidate known safety issues. We developed several graphical displays for routine safety data collected during a clinical trial, covering a broad range of graphical techniques, and illustrate here 10 specific graphical designs, many of which display the data along with statistics derived from them. Two are simple plots, comparing distributions in the form of boxplots or cumulative plots, and four more display data and summaries over time, comparing information from two groups in terms of distribution (with boxplots), cumulative incidence, hazard, or simply means with error bars. The other four are multi-panel displays: one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of scatterplots, a trellis of individual profiles, and a paired dotplot displaying risk together with relative risk. The displays focus on key safety endpoints in clinical trials including the QT interval from electrocardiograms, laboratory measurements for detecting hepatotoxicity, and adverse events of special interest. We discuss in detail the statistical and graphical principles underlying the production and interpretation of the displays.","inCitations":["70d4a0a81d7e7684c588b040fa50dc28d6295cce","5624295eebbaa7741a84a68a5056b2e7121f3829","af2445dd751c123d75f64c188edfff4ac0d17f4b","6c6550d12747eb9e9b6c20df12de0b58e247abb6","b30bdc24eb1635d9d0a9772d248b32a8dae25a76","38af6f4265bacb95f0329479b8463633f2662baa","5053b1f20f57797dfecc5e6637cca7bcada72af6","599501baa5277e126c54be7de4696e78bc609e4d","6baf88c5c5d3515adf0fac359e2e1709503f4534","a10e95a1899e0ee91ed64d02c3e55b1f844a2c71","d95f7dbf355c0d3fb618def2723159e0d243152e","cb3fe55472e6b872b8a67f61d3f8bb18a27a51fa","cc56eee031c0c393373f511535238ccd9612c331","10871c8ffdeb0fa458e690fd934fb4004d00568b","6710383721c69f189e0c96005e6c6e062ecd4b32","b9f2a64c562e7339c3783ba45f1d9e0eff1e9e59","2f5bf2211bfd737cfa78acd0fdcc48ae4056d4c9","6b40ed20e834576c67f6ef9a17a4752a9e9a9225","8e6e6db71b329456d3c6fce18e25ea7138d72950","5caf80a3d4d92e4f1379a98595cf3c3f704464cf","f9b2c6c4c841c88f7cfd825431dddf3205b7b79b","2571d286ed63190d055acd8261ce1d8325d2d80b","00ad3e665e6d40765c67a5b752fa5dae49e56901","290f672aa27b6670fa568ee26edb1feeaa4ca993","0c8378aa6181cb22b3d7e55a23744c13109b90a2","c3fc75c6b3318cd4699b58fcadfa17ec1d6e3f4e","e07398cd5be767c52fd52672076f1439fa08506a","94ad8acefbe6bec94ebc8621f6cb8ae7a7af0d3a","1a963ff7f3795ecefa3ee9f634571ccd67a74e22","5c40ea00ca77f22827aa395b5ec7906daabac644","4ddc97989610194470c755164714ac20d505b963","47a1c08cbb8b572e67221410ab64484e88c0a565","301b149f2958ef0531c9ab7b91acc9d04277aff2","bc3da72aed17d158d897c9b10857d106f4335585","f4a6355207b283778aa2b1f7c8f23191115e8a4c","3cfe5f38c7097ae568750cd5f5a52e55f43ebad8"],"title":"Graphical approaches to the analysis of safety data from clinical trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.254"}

Mixed-effects models with different time-varying decay rate functions have been proposed in literature. However, there are two unresolved critical issues: (i) it is not clear which model is more appropriate for practical use, and (ii) the model random errors are commonly assumed to follow a normal distribution, which may be unrealistic and can obscure important features of within- and among-subject variations. Because asymmetry of HIV viral load data is still noticeable even after transformation, it is important to use a more general distribution family that enables the unrealistic normal assumption to be relaxed. We developed skew-elliptical (SE) Bayesian mixed-effects models by considering the model random errors to have an SE distribution. We compared the performance among five SE models that have different time-varying decay rate functions. For each model, we also contrasted the performance under different model random error assumption such as normal, Student-t, skew-normal or skew-t distribution. Two AIDS clinical trial data sets were used to illustrate the proposed models and methods. The results indicate that the model with a time-varying viral decay rate that has two exponential components is preferred. Among the four distribution assumptions, the skew-t and skew-normal models provided better fitting to the data than normal or Student-t model, suggesting that it is important to assume a model with a skewed distribution in order to achieve reasonable results when the data exhibit skewness.","inCitations":["70171ceb90e92d7496310d308c870422cd980d5f"],"title":"Mixed-effects Models with Skewed Distributions for Time-varying Decay Rate in HIV Dynamics","doi":"10.1080/03610918.2013.873129"}

The posterior mode of the distribution is proposed as a point estimate and results are compared with the conventional method of estimation of NNT done by inversion.","inCitations":["ebd8371c9074f762bc977590e883bdae6483163b","ec004aad53d207e865d5d094259080a49b720eb4"],"title":"A closer look at the distribution of number needed to treat (NNT): a Bayesian approach.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.3.365"}

Generalized linear mixed models provide effective methods to estimate within-family associations but typically require parametric specification of the random effects distribution. Although misspecification of the random effects distribution often leads to little bias in estimated regression coefficients in standard, prospective clustered data settings, some recent studies suggest that such misspecification will impact parameter estimates from outcome-dependent cluster sampling designs. Using analytic results, simulation studies and fits to example data, this study examines the effect of misspecification of random effects distributions on parameter estimates in clustered data settings with outcome-dependent sampling. We show that the effects are consistent with results from prospective cluster sampling settings. In particular, ascertainment corrected mixed model methods that assume normally distributed random intercepts and conditional likelihood approaches provide accurate estimates of within-family covariate effects even under a misspecified random effects distribution.","inCitations":["bcdd15851628e15ff11d837691713ffecb644d3c","0518727d7394c511e1e051f1ea3ff9fdb291f663","19592270feeed640b89b6f50d08fc766ca5d466f"],"title":"The effect of misspecification of random effects distributions in clustered data settings with outcome-dependent sampling.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.10117"}

Complicating such analyses is often the presence of missing data. The standard model for missing data, missing at random (MAR), has some unattractive features in this context. In this paper we compare MAR-based estimates of the complier average causal effect (CACE) with an estimator based on an alternative, nonignorable model for the missing data process, developed by Frangakis and Rubin (1999, Biometrika, 86, 365-379). We also introduce a new missing data model that, like the Frangakis-Rubin model, is specially suited for models with instrumental variables, but makes different substantive assumptions. We analyze these issues in the context of a randomized trial of breast self-examination (BSE). In the study two methods of teaching BSE, consisting of either mailed information about BSE (the standard treatment) or the attendance of a course involving theoretical and practical sessions (the new treatment), were compared with the aim of assessing whether teaching programs could increase BSE practice and improve examination skills. The study was affected by the two sources of bias mentioned above: only 55% of women assigned to receive the new treatment complied with their assignment and 35% of the women did not respond to the post-test questionnaire. Comparing the causal estimand of the new treatment using the MAR, Frangakis-Rubin, and our new approach, the results suggest that for these data the MAR assumption appears least plausible, and that the new model appears most plausible among the three choices.","inCitations":["e6c93dcda4d6ce6e8f762bd3524788e07b36b8e1","ac698a726f5efc3abbeb85f99b35ce724253188b","fa3701a731d9ad242c1f65a201f819abdfc1541d","cb9227ac8b864adbec32b94e8fbd22c0b8282014","35e22b4ad73e4bd31ba95d9b9866eeb98a4d70cc","9e9e63daf7d48b7ff8ffca72c0d1ac029d9094ec","de7c7783cb8b5655182ecdee5710f7bac6a21af1","859678ebdf6b771f8aabaa4ca61903e7cb4600cf","d3df16ff05a84e95cef42535cfe0575499aa99e1","30e575fbce864be687822f79a983031fe80969ae","20a4554d8fcf65aa7d4af737121da24602f42d56","53d3a5186999cd83d6b360d8caa9f4d639e839e7","a2cfe46e54a246f13b379977c0a7183983412e47","cc1158ac81794d26ae3b4a955c265e160bdd1769","2d59ae5adc6561f73e1dd4557d8a7b5d883d20c3","7592440bd8e64529af0abd3d225ce243f2b37a79","64d1846336da0ae9f59efcb3a6a71b25041586d5","f3f1107c4628140b41595e253262e5ef233e1ede","78a4448a0024bc99005d23f2798d1ad674049606","f97c54972314dd70a30c679d24916ed2e51a9f7e","047b09af534cca308e2acdd02c0346759e1a2997","be3b5ade286f7cb5ad1a98269144a8435f686b0b","28ce8d1184d7afbe3e42a182c5575e72680867c2","0146f5eeb3d5900acfdf8aec42f409c62289b529","073825974c645417a124eec9cb7b4cc2e62b2cae","911d48a6a5824c24e90ef5edf8a53d665a3253ce","8baf103a4e82c36bc3fa5468d75190987b0d8baa","365e001bf451b6c7d0ef8aad2f4ba74ce196a840","fd7d98f927c0eef7fa546662de784997a27144e5","2b29f976ff8ac211e659332fe423c28078c1f23f","b0847b755a86ec2b4a79aa5e795b73e2810bc1df","7c1177fb9ec1fbcc2f6c3c3b44bc2e0fc1807923","078d900698a2a86d85bfe088e8d7e2e0373794e1","0a37723460a6fb7b37cd391ea207530f05ac71d0","e9e2a3352f4de16192d41e5812947ba1533ba52a","9aaf9bd34a3186e96ec52377b3e8ca9e86caed99","171235d411cb3773cd32914e6a219d7d38ee8832","8a5a63aee29045884de71283b875092325942834","c8cfd3ce5318e8f312a2afa6bb3f7ec40cd7fcd0","55cd5f874b9830b2a91b090dc8b225045c705b6c","e973bf33c4ef4e12ca8b693802cb8d02989b3c56","9b908af57d30ca62760c43c9be9b459faf4248c4","2003d09123ca8c903955cc235bd4444c589da710","28179b66e2d1037a58d3168e273b17b6a511b06b","0bab694fe0f98f33c7d51c85667f87324629c0d1","0fb9c09f1bdf09283aa537a09c16966a4cd31d0c","ac2f96af32f1158c5db28278eb28353faca06eef","c49c3a46a0f98d97255073a8d82fb05a1d3026c9","cbd1c163ca147a6b645d43a9beaef9e6ab6079b7","93efcbcf818a45997b37cf57ff5213889d37920a","4e531650ac8959c7f4b085f0d71c5510b5f7be65"],"title":"Analyzing a randomized trial on breast self-examination with noncompliance and missing outcomes.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.2.207"}

Methods that aggregate transformed p-value evidence have been widely used in genomic settings, among which Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are the most popular ones. In practice, raw data and p-values of DE evidence are often not available in genomic studies that are to be combined. Instead, only the detected DE gene lists under a certain p-value threshold (e.g., DE genes with p-value < 0.001) are reported in journal publications. The truncated p-value information makes the aforementioned meta-analysis methods inapplicable and researchers are forced to apply a less efficient vote counting method or naïvely drop the studies with incomplete information. The purpose of this paper is to develop effective meta-analysis methods for such situations with partially censored p-values. We developed and compared three imputation methods-mean imputation, single random imputation and multiple imputation-for a general class of evidence aggregation methods of which Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are special examples. The null distribution of each method was analytically derived and subsequent inference and genomic analysis frameworks were established. Simulations were performed to investigate the type Ierror, power and the control of false discovery rate (FDR) for (correlated) gene expression data. The proposed methods were applied to several genomic applications in colorectal cancer, pain and liquid association analysis of major depressive disorder (MDD). The results showed that imputation methods outperformed existing naïve approaches. Mean imputation and multiple imputation methods performed the best and are recommended for future applications.","inCitations":["178eabc9a4ce9af5328242c6b202b499fd2cb4c6","4046a7c5ad27cf666d20bd3af9827f4793c036c4","fc4ec7830089aae8603e3203a512372f17b5dc86"],"title":"Imputation of Truncated p-Values For Meta-Analysis Methods and Its Genomic Application.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS747"}

The main drawback is the strong parametric assumption such as FMR models with normal distributed residuals. The estimation might be biased if the model is misspecified. To relax the parametric assumption about the component error densities, a new method is proposed to estimate the mixture regression parameters by only assuming that the components have log-concave error densities but the specific parametric family is unknown. Two EM-type algorithms for the mixtures of regression models with log-concave error densities are proposed. Numerical studies are made to compare the performance of our algorithms with the normal mixture EM algorithms. When the component error densities are not normal, the new methods have much smaller MSEs when compared with the standard normal mixture EM algorithms. When the underlying component error densities are normal, the new methods have comparable performance to the normal EM algorithm.","inCitations":["24b7f2ab6705c966405d3ca48bdfaf1cee1ffe19","b113f3009bcbb1bdf34da81bc9983c6fb77d67f9"],"title":"The robust EM-type algorithms for log-concave mixtures of regression models","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2017.01.004"}

Estimation is often based on maximum likelihood theory, which assumes that the underlying probability model is correctly specified. Recent research shows that the results obtained from these models are not always robust against departures from the assumptions on which they are based. Therefore, diagnostic tools for the detection of model misspecifications are of the utmost importance. In this paper, we propose 2 diagnostic tests that are based on 2 equivalent representations of the model information matrix. We evaluate the power of both tests using theoretical considerations as well as via simulation. In the simulations, the performance of the new tools is evaluated in many settings of practical relevance, focusing on misspecification of the random-effects structure. In all the scenarios, the results were encouraging, however, the tests also exhibited inflated Type I error rates when the sample size was small or moderate. Importantly, a parametric bootstrap version of the tests seems to overcome this problem, although more research in this direction may be needed. Finally, both tests were also applied to analyze a real case study in psychiatry.","inCitations":["f1a86e04374df089ad21e33c73acce1aabedd3b4","07b0c0de0a65da47d29b3d412c1a662ad77de964","14cdd0b23e01db308f1173122e94199e776f3d94","c20a4e785621961ce4e235c7cc3c3f35fa4fcbb9","cbff9b411c9f124c9134a7262c48c4b5b61473fc","cf9effe87228448c8c1f1cd5f2f847e991934e60","80cae352e33ed3586449c93449e9c3dd4a994e6d","0518727d7394c511e1e051f1ea3ff9fdb291f663","c772da6dae7b9abee0b55360a6154ec50aa7189b","55c8be0cbe6dbfdb458fba5dbf8f581f86ef9e8a"],"title":"Testing for misspecification in generalized linear mixed models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq019"}

The same test also was performed on scores that had been explicitly selected to have nearly equal sample variances. The desired homogeneity of variance was brought about by repeatedly rejecting pairs of samples having a ratio of standard deviations that exceeded a predetermined cut-off value of 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3, while retaining pairs with ratios less than the cut-off value. Despite this forced conformity with the assumption of equal variances, the tests on the selected samples were no more robust than tests on unselected samples, and in most cases substantially less robust. Under conditions where sample sizes were unequal, so that Type I error rates were inflated and power curves were atypical, the selection procedure produced still greater inflation and distortion of the power curves.","inCitations":["f9752b51fcd41b9ef4ad1d1e0d054d00fef2e89d","69665289e39b75e9cf133d3ed6d01610d6eddd26","61de8bc6fb9bb8cb8f06b8cbb4ec9de1474a8a4c"],"title":"Consequences of choosing samples in hypothesis testing to ensure homogeneity of variance.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12001"}
