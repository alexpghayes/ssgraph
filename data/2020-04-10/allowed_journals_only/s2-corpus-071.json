It contains a logistic regression for the cure rate, and a Cox regression to estimate the hazard for uncured patients. A single predictive model for both the cure and hazard can be developed by using a cure model that simultaneously predicts the cure rate and hazards for uncured patients; however, model selection is a challenge because of the lack of a measure for quantifying the predictive accuracy of a cure model. Recently, we developed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for determining the cure rate in a cure model (Asano et al., 2014), but the hazards measure for uncured patients was not resolved. In this article, we propose novel C-statistics that are weighted by the patients' cure status (i.e., cured, uncured, or censored cases) for the cure model. The operating characteristics of the proposed C-statistics and their confidence interval were examined by simulation analyses. We also illustrate methods for predictive model selection and for further interpretation of variables using the proposed AUCs and C-statistics via application to breast cancer data.","inCitations":["966b317fdda7774b291de3950d02c9b83623f519"],"title":"Assessing the prediction accuracy of a cure model for censored survival data with long-term survivors: Application to breast cancer data.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1293082"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Computational statistics & data analysis","paperAbstract":"Recent technological advances in continuous biological monitoring and personal exposure assessment have led to the collection of subject-specific functional data. A primary goal in such studies is to assess the relationship between the functional predictors and the functional responses. The historical functional linear model (HFLM) can be used to model such dependencies of the response on the history of the predictor values. An estimation procedure for the regression coefficients that uses a variety of regularization techniques is proposed. An approximation of the regression surface relating the predictor to the outcome by a finite-dimensional basis expansion is used, followed by penalization of the coefficients of the neighboring basis functions by restricting the size of the coefficient differences to be small. Penalties based on the absolute values of the basis function coefficient differences (corresponding to the LASSO) and the squares of these differences (corresponding to the penalized spline methodology) are studied. The fits are compared using an extension of the Akaike Information Criterion that combines the error variance estimate, degrees of freedom of the fit and the norm of the bases function coefficients. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated via simulations. The LASSO penalty applied to the linearly transformed coefficients yields sparser representations of the estimated regression surface, while the quadratic penalty provides solutions with the smallest L(2)-norm of the basis functions coefficients. Finally, the new estimation procedure is applied to the analysis of the effects of occupational particulate matter (PM) exposure on the heart rate variability (HRV) in a cohort of boilermaker workers. Results suggest that the strongest association between PM exposure and HRV in these workers occurs as a result of point exposures to the increased levels of particulate matter corresponding to smoking breaks.","inCitations":["33154338b17a74b27d6ba43677143940f0792526","81a1722919dbef26b4661595486d30f659768cd7","c4a404eb202be07d3f5ca7ef544686ee2d831f35","78a4e97944cd67bd68aff8dd9a5e729a545c5392","a88782fcc380b561a766f0064d63fb6844d3552e","7883a3f2af7133e3a71f1d270cff04aa1198269d","c6d3df6f66d6a5a07a30a4c492b78b8385f0a616","6728a8197cbaccbebdc2d32252de7b4fdd82d1ce","363a64705edcf20d0887ec48a39b8df1bab8da07","85ab648eb8d88e4e563e84ef7cc2f8a3ac1b63fd","1f211db351ad7528d9aafc93767f30e8cc185571","32c303575935b2a995dcc52aee866d6e11d61c6b","8876cf0879ee6690e085b02933da004466fc4b8a","77a7e028c624e68d7f8d83de0bb5222a9db27956","93aafde13fc2ce1bf6d4bd4845be6ad64420ea05","822816ed789bf0120230c15df14f8c76d04d1f41","108d51eddd2604c3b2ac27cdd21c9cba6c10bdeb","569ae7e7f4733ad3f5f93c26da443ab766138975","a8a42db2b9d6c9aeeed4c50de38d93da7824988c","f3bc919386a105aab6cc25aa33ccff4e74f34876","3ad33326038ea0e91265acc238ff8c76ca49a845","287806c883a167e23e7b3a1430b752a2d5dc5d88","8124bcc1d5913399b692c2355c50deb7df9e2c0d","cf7c025b5ca3c0e936828d783667d4f862364b0e","fc226820b90fbf833ac021fcf664ff4b31177871","3c1363e831ed8fd03ec4e9b0dac5372459718bae","0e07e609307e1599a04545cb76c46cc154c39ba1","5c216523475d41585281bcb87c95784399a39df1","bace4ff89cb00358b76f5b1c3d672fc5b575c541","3d9f77f9e99f72919cedb208f8bde012faa89739"],"title":"Penalized solutions to functional regression problems","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2006.09.034"}

Investigators pursuing such designs may be interested in the cost of the unbalanced design relative to a balanced design with respect to the total number of patients required for the study. We present graphical displays to illustrate the sample size adjustment factor, or ratio of the sample size required by an unequal allocation compared to the sample size required by a balanced allocation, for various survival rates, treatment hazards ratios, and sample size allocation ratios.

Common to these ordination methods is the use of biologically motivated definitions of similarity. Principal coordinate analysis, in particular, is often performed using ecologically defined distances, allowing analyses to incorporate context-dependent, non-Euclidean structure. In this paper, we go beyond dimension-reduced ordination methods and describe a framework of high-dimensional regression models that extends these distance-based methods. In particular, we use kernel-based methods to show how to incorporate a variety of extrinsic information, such as phylogeny, into penalized regression models that estimate taxonspecific associations with a phenotype or clinical outcome. Further, we show how this regression framework can be used to address the compositional nature of multivariate predictors comprised of relative abundances; that is, vectors whose entries sum to a constant. We illustrate this approach with several simulations using data from two recent studies on gut and vaginal microbiomes. We conclude with an application to our own data, where we also incorporate a significance test for the estimated coefficients that represent associations between microbial abundance and a percent fat.","inCitations":["888a3f5e7ebdf5efb2c9998461715d7ce31dfe65","79cec67aed5165b3464a1ea18cd8aea3e525013b","2f35c5354c8f639377b9014f3df4240cbfb75fc9","be813b90620b2627226864eaf5e0f3eec9d50e85","7d004fb899674ba5cd31c84503e1d818fc9f2275","152f2a8780fe03a323b2f1e05df7377c406a5232","c07464907d39a9af1d8f4a36b1c6e47f652e8dfa","edeb7e2b20cecac3459f8ad61a9b09ba1499549a","16bd7b4379e1d2f65dd0cfe1a55123899a540dfd","e72a59076a28488d1c4359eaee8387f5d12eaf19","bf56bbca26d6b957c2a0025e813b8894a3fec32c","cd4c791aa839bbc53cae7aaa90925055c8c3ab8b","d708571991b4dcf16909e8de51aa9b4c8fa26984"],"title":"Kernel-penalized Regression for Analysis of Microbiome Data.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1102"}

To estimate the frequency of genotyping errors and assess the reproducibility of genotype calls, we analyzed two sets of duplicate data, one dataset containing twenty blind duplicates and another dataset containing twenty-eight non-random duplicates, from a genome-wide association study using Affymetrix GeneChip® 100K Human Mapping Arrays. For the twenty blind duplicates the overall agreement in genotyping calls as measured with the Kappa statistics, was 0.997, with a discordancy rate of 0.27%. For the twenty-eight nonrandom duplicates, the overall agreement was lower, 0.95, with a higher discordancy rate of 4.53%. The accuracy and probability of concordancy were inversely related to the genotyping uncertainty score, i.e., as the genotyping uncertainty score increased, the concordancy and probability of concordant calls decreased. Lowering of the uncertainty score threshold for rejection of genotype calls from the Affymetrix recommended value of 0.25 to 0.20 resulted in an increased predicted accuracy from 92.6% to 95% with a slight increase in the \"No Call\" rate from 1.81% to 2.33%. Hence, we suggest using a lower uncertainty score threshold, say 0.20, which will result in higher accuracy in calls at a modest decrease in the call rate.","inCitations":["9339111f4c1f4df1230d7e866e7df9b1d05dd02c","8f0c0a5309bbfa07e8f8d9220acce561dd2832a2","9091bf8a496ba35126bf5e6ad391e2525345d2b6"],"title":"Reproducibility of genotypes as measured by the affymetrix GeneChip® 100K Human Mapping Array set","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.05.020"}

Each dose assignment is guided via a feasibility bound, which thereby can control the number of patients allocated to excessively toxic dose levels. Several aspects of the NOC design are explored, including the coherence property in dose assignment, calibration of design parameters, and selection of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We further propose a fractional NOC (fNOC) design in conjunction with a so-called fractional imputation approach, to account for late-onset toxicity outcomes. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to show that both the NOC and fNOC designs have robust and satisfactory finite-sample performance compared with the existing dose-finding designs. The proposed methods also possess several desirable properties: treating patients more safely and also neutralizing the aggressive escalation to overly toxic doses when the toxicity outcomes are late-onset. The fNOC design is exemplified with a real cancer phase I trial.","inCitations":["4f8d7ad66144917f3beb663b0b14d074f2d924c5","4ba7e4524e903c95c980b05690115151e745d75d","6b478146a1b8e4fe2474d69d278fdae5564cf0ec","3f976a9c0c01ed7d6a9b6f298bef63fc28eb315a"],"title":"Nonparametric overdose control with late-onset toxicity in phase I clinical trials.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw038"}

Because estimation of variability is inextricably linked to estimation of trend, assumptions about underlying trends are minimized by using nonparametric regression estimates.

Although the research studies on the crossover design have been quite intensive, the discussions on analyzing ordinal data under such a design are truly limited. We propose using the generalized odds ratio (GOR) for paired sample data to measure the relative effect on patient responses for both treatment and period in ordinal data under a simple crossover trial. Assuming the treatment and period effects are multiplicative, we note that one can easily derive the maximum likelihood estimator (LE) in closed forms for the GOR of treatment and period effects. We develop asymptotic and exact procedures for testing treatment and period effects. We further derive asymptotic and exact interval estimators for the GOR of treatment and period effects. We use the data taken from a crossover trial to assess the clarity of leaflet instructions between two devices among asthma patients to illustrate the use of these test procedures and estimators developed here.","inCitations":["89f20f760a9059eb6bc5bea3f231ae434ae096d0","5dce1ba8e7179c8a533964fed2b58e8661697b04","d4a2981fb417af290a34543109d7b8e917c22f52","636ce08d13c374799f3ac4546895805d3ee01c1c"],"title":"Hypothesis testing and estimation in ordinal data under a simple crossover design.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.574326"}

One attractive model is the semiparametric density ratio model, under which the conditional density function is the product of an unknown baseline density function and a known parametric function containing the covariate information. This model has a natural connection with generalized linear models and is closely related to biased sampling problems. Despite the attractive features and importance of this model, most existing methods are too restrictive since they are based on multi-sample data or conditional likelihood functions. The conditional likelihood approach can eliminate the unknown baseline density but cannot estimate it. We propose efficient estimation procedures based on the nonparametric likelihood. The nonparametric likelihood approach allows for general forms of covariates and estimates the regression parameters and the baseline density simultaneously. Therefore, the nonparametric likelihood approach is more versatile than the conditional likelihood approach especially when estimation of the conditional mean or other quantities of the outcome is of interest. We show that the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators are consistent, asymptotically normal, and asymptotically efficient. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well in practical settings. A real example is used for illustration.","inCitations":["2cc01eaf724b5a2fbd0d6c9ff071368f9abe5421","57307a6a13c3601830c446baa0a3d99aa646faf2","c7786e4aad8644bc2be89411700075431041139f","fc169ad89713f6eecb76d6889b23dd946dfdb735"],"title":"Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Semiparametric Density Ratio Model","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1372"}

With such data, it is critical to account for these genotypic correlations when assessing the contribution of variants by gene or pathway. Recognizing the limitations of existing association testing methods, we propose Adaptive-weight Burden Test (ABT), a retrospective, mixed-model test for genetic association of quantitative traits on genotype data with complex correlations. This method makes full use of genotypic correlations across both samples and variants, and adopts \"data-driven\" weights to improve power. We derive the ABT statistic and its explicit distribution under the null hypothesis, and demonstrate through simulation studies that it is generally more powerful than the fixed-weight burden test and family-based SKAT in various scenarios, controlling for the type I error rate. Further investigation reveals the connection of ABT with kernel tests, as well as the adaptability of its weights to the direction of genetic effects. The application of ABT is illustrated by a whole genome analysis of genes with common and rare variants associated with fasting glucose from the NHLBI \"Grand Opportunity\" Exome Sequencing Project.","inCitations":["59fd65f8698a810ce8f99eceea64c94604a106c8"],"title":"Adaptive-weight Burden Test for Associations between Quantitative Traits and Genotype Data with Complex Correlations.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1121"}

The estimator improves upon existing methods by using an approximate second-order expansion of the parameter functional, in addition to the first-order expansion employed by standard doubly robust methods. This results in weaker assumptions about the convergence rates necessary to establish consistency, local efficiency, and asymptotic linearity. The general estimation strategy is developed under the targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) framework. We present a simulation comparing the sensitivity of the first and second-order estimators to the convergence rate of the initial estimators of the outcome regression and missingness score. In our simulation, the second-order TMLE always had a coverage probability equal or closer to the nominal value 0.95, compared to its first-order counterpart. In the best-case scenario, the proposed second-order TMLE had a coverage probability of 0.86 when the first-order TMLE had a coverage probability of zero. We also present a novel first-order estimator inspired by a second-order expansion of the parameter functional. This estimator only requires one-dimensional smoothing, whereas implementation of the second-order TMLE generally requires kernel smoothing on the covariate space. The first-order estimator proposed is expected to have improved finite sample performance compared to existing first-order estimators. In the best-case scenario of our simulation study, the novel first-order TMLE improved the coverage probability from 0 to 0.90. We provide an illustration of our methods using a publicly available dataset to determine the effect of an anticoagulant on health outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We provide R code implementing the proposed estimator.","inCitations":["2b49c933491afc9da5f9a2f94f5f852fd42690b5","e22ff66105359b033de05f2468cd989906682773","0a6a9e5c3ea9d0aaf7017dc31beb973dbf964592","4d76a996ae6d8372e3ca6ef947ba72930e11eff3","bb8602ef29eaac870040930e21a65fbe67f6504d","fd7d092f01bed73e8dd5fe100efee243e0cc18e8","ec5dcf1f3c0344398b9eab79440d28bb0b623f10","a8d96725525660c33256814faad47fe06611b2f1"],"title":"Second-Order Inference for the Mean of a Variable Missing at Random","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0031"}

This paper introduces a new technique that can simultaneously estimate and select the model in generalized method of moments (GMM) context. The GMM is particularly powerful for analyzing complex data sets such as longitudinal and panel data, and it has wide applications in econometrics. This paper extends the least squares based adaptive elastic net estimator of Zou and Zhang (2009) to nonlinear equation systems with endogenous variables. The extension is not trivial and involves a new proof technique due to estimators lack of closed form solutions. Compared to Bridge-GMM of Caner (2009), we allow for the number of parameters to diverge to infinity as well as collinearity among a large number of variables, also the redundant parameters set to zero via a data dependent technique. This method has the oracle property, meaning that we can estimate nonzero parameters with their standard limit and the redundant parameters are dropped from the equations simultaneously. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the performance of the new method.","inCitations":["6bb97c455cbfab44697ad1e029ee2997c815c54c","d80595cb291e5e017165f27f3062922e0ceda449","2f84a0451f5c0390e996d96d83f772b809dc2329","453fcb5966ce97d0e204aa9b3909733d4da7d478","f324adb2a31f93a86103e9ce7f17a05e5cde32ae","60f08cabf0de1085cb32dd13cb686af12ca1c390","3a60633adafb1a5d937cda0e69ddaac381edabf2","879687132131275e2b897548c797e052d743aa5c","3cdaaa6928ec448c06740cdeab3ebad132197652","cbdee5c72cac0f46d7c40f7d60abab6ca4aae8b7","53f026816fa0ce9153782f9a56d4c7c12cb488d1","8f5b492d5d147c20f7ec60aaae9cb807fa93bc9f","f375efc93562ae8540bf3bdc27d19153a38f3949","5068e3a7e2a8f617a55a7ac447c7c622ca84b636","8cfaee17d21ae9b8b9fc46c55b64742221f79805","1a4d365571252a70c9db0e94b0a5d98f128e7c78","712e2a340ee4834ccd62dc6bfd7bdc57fc09a2ed","1959d19fc3b3145afceb3d87e0a0e461ee7ddc70","dcdc71362c91fc6c8fd890994cc5007bc56f3f97","f49b9933befa4d7b08557269dfbcbf470b854b1a","1660b97b4cee1205d099844d6ece4afe43a63cf7"],"title":"Adaptive Elastic Net for Generalized Methods of Moments.","doi":"10.1080/07350015.2013.836104"}

Many methods have been proposed for this setting, but the connections and differences between their statistical formulations have received less attention. In this paper, we show how a broad class of statistical network inference methods, including a number of existing approaches, can be described in terms of variable selection for the linear model. This reveals some subtle but important differences between the methods, including the treatment of time intervals in discretely observed data. In developing a general formulation, we also explore the relationship between single-cell stochastic dynamics and network inference on averages over cells. This clarifies the link between biochemical networks as they operate at the cellular level and network inference as carried out on data that are averages over populations of cells. We present empirical results, comparing thirty-two network inference methods that are instances of the general formulation we describe, using two published dynamical models. Our investigation sheds light on the applicability and limitations of network inference and provides guidance for practitioners and suggestions for experimental design.","inCitations":["825f537a31a1458e51f36d28e4133cb5b9115892","766a922790b4373b2435f9f320d82ebe6f574089","da363f37f0706022668480d9181b0cdd9a8f5b19","c76ec6a0a42f88d516694b0ad5e0929c7765dfe2","d0c0f0521817fa50fae1f7ef476e0639c37f9ea4","ee4ca1f91d0f60bc7d2f3094362a9c476a5ec016","69e901b5984ffb6951c47bed06aaeaa42980309c","592fdef00f1bf6c3cff395c7af8753d68a3292be","b5be0ee3644c72352b2a3bd13b32f7025b60eded","e267f45435500d8fc5f384006d0e285dbcf61d5e","559001427f69d718b671ff6ad966e53e39287fb5","0923c7bff280dc923d518bd3dcfb98c37b3762ea","6bd729d2b4829abeb7ffef29989b6ecca8f84d0c","0f0b96ecd6930ddee547c1e39b5e3dc34dac785a","8a965b86eb998d4e120283bfc298230bb6a77250","56f006dd0479ae76201c645b992b6021c6201d9d","ff0605a012929c7a478052a9a0e8dfb44984ae69","0268c6089a3f337478c8ef57ff20972c75668a92","820d5ea0b8d86836b5d7cc80935dcd7487abdcb4","a95e28e2640c6dcb572b2d0dfbedb56cd0519600","8749af26ccdf8496859e0c45927a9925d6589e48","d8d6101a9af676c55008a80b026801189dc874a2","b73fcc51b179490128aaf7981f01d2dbcd57fbce","dcb7e37ed57105c5abe61e2572d274823dd1ba5a","baff21683ee9b18fcaad0e051e986cb004e22983","a7db09695c08fe5c933d368b6a8bb9631249c88b","4d432f362aee6d56569f031fb7970554e6f73e3c","83c25c1e9cb69bf6108ecf48a6779d5d513bb5d0","a0d8f626e1375240a2ab0bc7b71583210cd08ada","07fcf18907947c913d7eab660165e34691b14462","a8fe764ee996495b47e9ad27e1376a171892626e","c2d5cf4a7efee0244459357d91cf8edd8f509aeb","b545eb54336702ab79b87e144b0dd50a5462dd47","423ee341652d9990ffc40de0c27a28cd4aaff5a1","be50267d98477e448ac4e49d08a64c94ebfea1b1","7f1b71f5d6e2c7d5560c1e3303b238683ba389db","2daf6bc0cd5753b7b4d50d5ece8cc62f6f34d364","c3812bbe659d30c52429b41ab07db51a95809d62","a86d92774a17fa1cc231497c75e5cb9dac30fa78","73b18069bd68f23f1141bad6a6bd82075577ce7d","36d3c76de159d48b3d4f85b7cdc20c23a092a833","62666b5197fbf1adbe6b9648825dd977ef22c9a8","fbec348885435a57bebc7f46cecae6722a16f85e","c5f789000b08f9c5f15b521c9bab3353212d4a5b","cfe746d382495683b11ae55a48b011173a0c9de1","4a1779bc51639c8ab940c94a1b07c01658eb484c"],"title":"Network Inference and Biological Dynamics.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS532"}

Whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data collected for many thousands of SNP markers from thousands of individuals under the case-control design promise to shed light on our understanding of such interactions. However, nearby SNPs are highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the number of possible interactions is too large for exhaustive evaluation. We propose a novel Bayesian method for simultaneously partitioning SNPs into LD-blocks and selecting SNPs within blocks that are associated with the disease, either individually or interactively with other SNPs. When applied to homogeneous population data, the method gives posterior probabilities for LD-block boundaries, which not only result in accurate block partitions of SNPs, but also provide measures of partition uncertainty. When applied to case-control data for association mapping, the method implicitly filters out SNP associations created merely by LD with disease loci within the same blocks. Simulation study showed that this approach is more powerful in detecting multi-locus associations than other methods we tested, including one of ours. When applied to the WTCCC type 1 diabetes data, the method identified many previously known T1D associated genes, including PTPN22, CTLA4, MHC, and IL2RA. The method also revealed some interesting two-way associations that are undetected by single SNP methods. Most of the significant associations are located within the MHC region. Our analysis showed that the MHC SNPs form long-distance joint associations over several known recombination hotspots. By controlling the haplotypes of the MHC class II region, we identified additional associations in both MHC class I (HLA-A, HLA-B) and class III regions (BAT1). We also observed significant interactions between genes PRSS16, ZNF184 in the extended MHC region and the MHC class II genes. The proposed method can be broadly applied to the classification problem with correlated discrete covariates.","inCitations":["7aaa7c150a71fe3c1ce92a1ab973407be3dbba26","12abe50901a154c19243bc364eebbf229e90f546","4fd6c69716510cb1725f8b82a940ae5b60847db2","6b799c4a94304a95ec5cd6c4d77bb06df260bc22","0f27e645bc6788b770bd2083a8e105e52c7a73c0","b766f6e40d508a15066fec73622edf7fec0687f7","d053a7841676c63385cd9e5b4abb845800d290e4","40d89c1f36307d779dead54918d56b3475a279b5","de280b5fdb3eac2a3be3976457556ae198b599f9","5822c60150340c64b2ee750be5459bac5df480a3","10373636b2e7702f54a374bb7f57c637c2946c08","e323d9ad21c8c9bddf38efc3d4987a405f2b02bd","2f2cc3885f9da6319c7ff9ccffb3a51362fddfa1","f34baaf2b0e52c5b2406ccfdca868d0e089b1097","b3849087c2612362c74b10c8033839f7d1fc4210","7a72f95fe6ca8ff2d147a78975efe664c87e807c","fcc6e24e85581880639785bb6e43f2ba77862fea","37c85dffa4415925c13d29f4d72bc62375ff8fd2","68e15813e6fd8b0fa1b668f1e7027d5a02991703","98893725573a6f4ae96ab24693539ef2c77008f3","59df097515c7b9ed4e4ddbab0531e653a736d811","3b909c34bc656f2992b86de40043419954123a48","517cc9b6d8eb2e3ccd058bfe60c7fb36912ebf1c","44e33866e2309978af355b7e9ef2aa3def3161cf"],"title":"Block-based Bayesian Epistasis Association Mapping with Application to Wtccc Type 1 Diabetes Data.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS469"}

However, their computer-intensive nature, which typically require a large number of iterations and a complete scan of the full dataset for each iteration, precludes their use for big data analysis. In this paper, we propose the so-called bootstrap Metropolis-Hastings (BMH) algorithm, which provides a general framework for how to tame powerful MCMC methods to be used for big data analysis; that is to replace the full data log-likelihood by a Monte Carlo average of the log-likelihoods that are calculated in parallel from multiple bootstrap samples. The BMH algorithm possesses an embarrassingly parallel structure and avoids repeated scans of the full dataset in iterations, and is thus feasible for big data problems. Compared to the popular divide-and-combine method, BMH can be generally more efficient as it can asymptotically integrate the whole data information into a single simulation run. The BMH algorithm is very flexible. Like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, it can serve as a basic building block for developing advanced MCMC algorithms that are feasible for big data problems. This is illustrated in the paper by the tempering BMH algorithm, which can be viewed as a combination of parallel tempering and the BMH algorithm. BMH can also be used for model selection and optimization by combining with reversible jump MCMC and simulated annealing, respectively.","inCitations":["a9555f73f6cf66cc0d643c87f8456effbd4e7ce7","c95a6d5e2639308f6e019f5919179915cd9aba13","407388e4d16ac19bd04ed34114fc24cbe81b93ac","9e650fb4b4d51a612a206d6094c74cf974ccda95","0558ff2ff7a425751c6817cc75c0f9c006a29478","4a82573ecae5865995a266b471fdb4bd81c6a0c5","62faec8832cfc61380eda1bc8b85aaab8245586f","6f0ba62fb7f55cd9c17322d738afd43bb58ff869"],"title":"A Bootstrap Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm for Bayesian Analysis of Big Data","doi":"10.1080/00401706.2016.1142905"}

Our method can be viewed as a natural extension of high-dimensional normal mixtures. However, the key difference is that smoothed structures are imposed for both the mean and covariance functions. The model is shown to be identifiable, and can be estimated efficiently by a combination of the ideas from EM algorithm, kernel regression, and functional principal component analysis. Our methodology is empirically justified by Monte Carlo simulations and illustrated by an analysis of a supermarket dataset.","inCitations":["3de7081c15f2c447d3367e4048087ca7bf83308a","1840b12c050fa5be7c562a04006ee799efae87c4","67be53cd6f3aa993e80d4395621b28f232247074","7b51e00c5854d78666563fe0401aa05c560d1bb0","24b7f2ab6705c966405d3ca48bdfaf1cee1ffe19","a0f62ed3e66ff786be9db76382d785bec9a3e590","521e5c337be51b8f8fdb858580bb46a0545ab1f9"],"title":"Estimating Mixture of Gaussian Processes by Kernel Smoothing.","doi":"10.1080/07350015.2013.868084"}

At least one between-person factor is crossed with at least one within-person factor, and the persons nested within the levels of the between-person factor are crossed with the items within levels of the within-person factor. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of models for binary data with crossed random effects is challenging. This is because the marginal likelihood does not have a closed form, so that MLE requires numerical or Monte Carlo integration. In addition, the multidimensional structure of MIRPs makes the estimation complex. In this paper, three different estimation methods to meet these challenges are described: the Laplace approximation to the integrand; hierarchical Bayesian analysis, a simulation-based method; and an alternating imputation posterior with adaptive quadrature as the approximation to the integral. In addition, this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these three estimation methods for MIRPs. The three algorithms are compared in a real data application and a simulation study was also done to compare their behaviour.","inCitations":["5408c143e62d27cc5d5873fda64fafbaf52c4445","d6fb2b43ccdaa1a605b631275af467749e12206d"],"title":"Parameter estimation of multiple item response profile model.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02036.x"}

We show that our specification of the random effect distribution leads to a max-stable process that has the popular Gaussian extreme value process (GEVP) as a limiting case. The proposed model is used to analyze the yearly maximum precipitation from a regional climate model.","inCitations":["6234c5c92bf476b9e3be2818721cfcead8e2b5ac","066ecc5765a5970d32350a124a8e1c6ecfa41107","3e12c2efe98f42b01d970dc7ee443e3591b24ac7","d0ca17bc37483aa3c52d13a9a9e3cd94dbffe61a","383126f4986ec9375ff691179bfb0ff7396190ff","895096b00a34029b0beb3894dd3b8fb92ac3ecee","3c148d2913616049e62337da2daf85bc6c6ead0c","aa573bb42e66877d4fa7ed68261be619e971a6a4","68fd7ea87fcca2c7a8e8d2565b992f4d482341b9","4616010f195886cef2744516ccd2bf1fa46128af","faca67ca61dc9d7a4d5c115830c63de36e7cb516","040999e869c56ab8d8d0231f9fd4cefb865d9e25","9f0f296e327bf3ea8c0c8d7b41eef82c2ad1d5da","baa0e3d4774fda54091e33edcfbc4e86fbb1a2af","d626fb5a437d7336877326e2d5c6fba2422e7e94","0db8119e2e5f7d23ddb18ccfc8a5f12925346c57","7986ca3676300a69173ead124ccfc5e78f0e94d0","94d14dbfa7faf8659763caea8b5dffe77898ed41","004493ae6f1f69251f357b6b4ac323544a1703bd","bdc157db7c101679cff85ef5d952d7bcb2532477","11e6a0dec05217cbf00b52d3d152a0a4cf0ada74","4d769e02facb260b891b4273c69749179b4c8d28","f3f8a1ae8abb13e096b4bb401302ab03d5efd3c8","2ef59f123060dd87f1e683d62d4666bda5a7ad49","b22742ee3d4cf4e25cb53f2a7bab410941a9e5df","58c8ccef180c55de9d676cb01aae5e8d97c8fded","d1ab2984d8ef72b3ea892e3317e4e65ee3ec4ca1","ea44d635c7f07e04f1b4fe6a14331e673654d9be","33cd5289353b615338cfae3bf343f248c6331df8","6c8cd2f2f484bc747ca5390e4ef121d75a75f392","4678fa5d4f0da7a4e01b7623f70d8411996d4552","9cce0186dfa6ebb4b603ade9a91b50b8a5094f5c","f6d1484308673e9cb67b66ed7a785e5c6dc3ddc7","2e354817a65c587de54f507646478b1f1ad3ad7e","66d3d67aba7ecfb9b7606b4ffe2b84c20a98a218","ffdfecdae47f3dc79945b933f7a452a5109c099a","c3a3aaad5e3dc345cc13a8007e577abb10c73051","a5557271931e8716f1fec37271779f69a3bdc64f","410709b50c83f82e3cd4722d1fdca64dfafd98b0","757b375d32eea94f3b6539621d41cf42a7a67012","05112210e4b86a27ecb369d82209eab6e6647b5f","8e0d2d3c2ae2b541c495c8df4d93c53162c7c566","d5a9f320c9b2c25bf62cd36042b01e0f2e3c9b42","034052848e861def481912bfcd02dc514f52e233","8f3404465a043309537ef61d312dde6400a2d125","e380b5c2ee2c6c8ce57b290961bf91ab94681bae","9101fb88e4b04738fb281f2c339e60ca432c08fb","92cada8ac2beab1dc2049ddf04350e9220d47fc5","5a377b13ad9870ba92668d0b47ad2ef1c96f4afe","e995a8423b80cc8ead8c0c1ddd639ef3df0f9ab3","080114e3058ccbdc3dd10ff79a7b3826934e388d","67f42d4b2022662a3bda26b982144e156d050e54","74962a44f099116d1ec7651a8523bf1242c24a66","18d99874fa73d1bbff9e0fecff4d53513f55a503","caf2f5a4edfbbd35b92078aa151dbf1a08992d05","dced375ed3be5fd13405ff12e3efd99be1c062d2","cdecb3180adb67092f78305955b4b834294296da","1c76f807768d49aa8f1cd1fb1feefa3481da07b5","bad59325103c826b852adc50166d501cadff5e07"],"title":"A Hierarchical Max-stable Spatial Model for Extreme Precipitation.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS591"}

This appeal to data aggregation is seen on various levels: across genetic variants, across genomic/biological/environmental measures and across different studies, often with fundamentally differing designs. While combining data can increase power to detect genetic variants associated with disease phenotypes, care must be taken in the design, analysis, and interpretation of such studies. Here, we explore methodologies employed to combine sources of genetic data and discuss the prospects for novel advances in the fields of statistical genetics and genetic epidemiology.","inCitations":["4ecdfc8c530bf1f5ca9e73d03166d69fee95b6c4"],"title":"Statistical Approaches to Combine Genetic Association Data.","doi":"10.4172/2155-6180.1000166"}
