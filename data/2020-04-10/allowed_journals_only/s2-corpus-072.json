McIntosh and Pepe (2002, Biometrics58, 657-644) showed that the risk score, defined as the probability of disease conditional on multiple markers, is the optimal function for classification based on the Neyman-Pearson Lemma. They proposed a two-step procedure to approximate the risk score. However, the resulted ROC curve is only defined in a subrange (L, h) of the false-positive rates in (0,1) and determination of the lower limit L needs extra prior information. In practice, most diagnostic tests are not perfect and it is usually rare that a single marker is uniformly better than the other tests. Using simulation, I show that multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) is a useful tool to approximate the risk score when combining multiple markers, especially when the ROC curves from multiple tests cross. The resulted ROC is defined in the whole range of (0,1) and it is easy to implement and has intuitive interpretation. The sample code of the application is shown in the appendix.","inCitations":["5b7634334d29fe8d2a6c533560eae227f325949d","d706fb1165318986f72e28b58c8047fc9a7201a8"],"title":"Approximating the risk score for disease diagnosis using MARS.","doi":"10.1080/02664760802499352"}

We investigate the performance of a dynamic linear mixed-effects (DLME) model and marginal structural model (MSM) in evaluating dose-response from flexible-dose titration clinical trials via simulations. The simulation results demonstrated that DLME models with previous exposure as a time-varying covariate may provide an unbiased and efficient estimator to recover exposure-response relationship from flexible-dose clinical trials. Although the MSM models with independent and exchangeable working correlations appeared to be able to recover the right direction of the dose-response relationship, it tended to over-correct selection bias and overestimated the underlying true dose-response. The MSM estimators were also associated with large variability in the parameter estimates. Therefore, DLME may be an appropriate modeling option in identifying dose-response when data from fixed-dose studies are absent or a fixed-dose design is unethical to be implemented.","inCitations":["d9a4787af011e5a1132833a94fd7837fd82a43a3","d393e682ba2bdc3c034c8e9ac6e72844fc05c3e2","2b5498dbe602705609c4c47b0dcdbc1ddf41c7fa","f00e57ba46dc6536da29aae38ecb77c125e9682e","9ad49073ca1b1680eca1c40f11a444df74774ce4"],"title":"Analysis of dose-response in flexible dose titration clinical studies.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1498"}

The discussion is motivated by screening designs for phase II studies. The proposed screening designs allow consideration of multiple treatments simultaneously. In each period, new treatments can arise and currently considered treatments can be dropped. Once a treatment is removed from the phase II screening trial, a terminal decision is made about abandoning the treatment or recommending it for a future confirmatory phase III study. The decision about dropping treatments from the active set is a sequential stopping decision. We propose a solution based on decision boundaries in the space of marginal posterior moments for the unknown parameter of interest that relates to each treatment. We present a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm to implement the proposed approach.

When the test statistics are dependent, the gamma distribution (GD) is commonly used for the Fisher's combination test (FCT). We propose to use two generalizations of the GD: the generalized and the exponentiated GDs. We study some properties of mis-using the GD for the FCT to combine dependent statistics when one of the two proposed distributions are true. Our results show that both generalizations have better control of type I error rates than the GD, which tends to have inflated type I error rates at more extreme tails. In practice, common model selection criteria (e.g. Akaike information criterion/Bayesian information criterion) can be used to help select a better distribution to use for the FCT. A simple strategy of the two generalizations of the GD in genome-wide association studies is discussed. Applications of the results to genetic pleiotrophic associations are described, where multiple traits are tested for association with a single marker.","inCitations":["f48c60e2d130e8a22dabe7d8b46189e031bedacf","b94b1e246eb39ff001d76e8ade073c37884937e3","659360d9f9d263645677566bc0e46a036ad0e0a9","d7b4959566a3d679839aeafe6ed50d4c4a2b73b8","e0f571de715ff6eda82cc08b59fcbdbed2ea6e35","aa6ef1e00f721d08d85470ca60b5742bbe84355c","7a363292df87a8f20683b417c78de9c943c08ca6","17f434da0c50a3c0bc8154a97be85a2eb3a2a75c","56337aed7cf8888b98406c9d78f5627329a58829","0312795799535bd73e7f70b4f1511c1fd177991f","2440fc978d46ff9253ec8f7806c68b083ce140ff"],"title":"Fisher's method of combining dependent statistics using generalizations of the gamma distribution with applications to genetic pleiotropic associations.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt045"}

In addition to the measurement of change, the longitudinal models we present can also be used to explain individual differences in change scores for person groups (e.g., learning disabled students versus non-learning disabled students) and to model differences in item difficulties across item groups (e.g., number operation, measurement, and representation item groups in a mathematics test). An empirical example illustrates the use of the various models for measuring individual differences in change when there are person groups and multiple skill domains which lead to multidimensionality at a time point.","inCitations":["836908d689f24704f315be65e8d356940ce89b95"],"title":"Measuring change for a multidimensional test using a generalized explanatory longitudinal item response model.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02058.x"}

When elements of uncertainty enter the theoretical structure, specifically at more subordinate levels of the hierarchy, the mathematical expectation of threat is particularly exacerbated. As quantified in this model, the exercise of decisional control is demonstrably related to reduction in expected threat (the minimum correlation across comprehensive parameter settings being .55). Disclosure of otherwise intractable stress-coping subtleties, endowed by the quantitative translation of verbal premises, is underscored. Formalization of decisional stress control is seen to usher in linkages to augmenting formal developments from fields of cognitive science, preference and choice modelling, and nonlinear dynamical systems theory.

At the beginning of a product development, sample sizes of a biosimilar and a reference product may be limited. Thus, a sample size calculation may not be feasible. During the development stage, more batches of reference products may be added at a later stage to have a more reliable estimate of the reference variability. On the other hand, we also need a sufficient number of biosimilar batches in order to have a better understanding of the product. Those challenges lead to a potential sample size imbalance. In this paper, we show that large sample size imbalance may increase the power of the equivalence test in an unfavorable way, giving higher power for less similar products when the sample size of biosimilar is much smaller than that of the reference product. Thus, it is necessary to make some sample size imbalance adjustments to motivate sufficient sample size for biosimilar as well. This paper discusses two adjustment methods for the equivalence test in analytical biosimilarity studies. Please keep in mind that sufficient sample sizes for both biosimilar and reference products (if feasible) are desired during the planning stage.","inCitations":["ab3c9f169e0dbbe937c7290cd4189df1c4b75792","00b17200b92771aaa132d2d95165e3e8552e9ba3","2487edd533c3f5bcf0b314157f83b588d107b0d5"],"title":"Adjustment for unbalanced sample size for analytical biosimilar equivalence assessment.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1265544"}

Several approaches, such as discrepant analysis, composite reference standard (CRS) method, or latent class analysis (LCA), are commonly applied for this purpose by combining multiple imperfect (reference) test results. In discrepant analysis or LCA, test results from the new assay are often involved in the construction of a new pseudo-reference standard, which results in the potential risk of overestimating the parameters of interest. On the contrary, the CRS methods only combine the results of reference tests, which is more preferable in practice. In this article, we study the properties of two extreme CRS methods, i.e., combining multiple reference test results by the \"any positive\" rule or by the \"all-positive\" rule, and propose a new approach \"dual composite reference standards (dCRS)\" based on these two extreme methods to reduce the biases of the estimates. Simulations are performed for various scenarios and the proposed approach is applied to two real datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other commonly used approaches and therefore is recommended for future applications.","inCitations":["bb26db3530e82e4cce1e8eabc8a52ef4c1714ee4","3a5cc6ff44df63c51d4fad84095463afc5a327e7"],"title":"Dual composite reference standards (dCRS) in molecular diagnostic research: A new approach to reduce bias in the presence of Imperfect reference.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2018.1428613"}

In order to adjust for other covariates or intra-subject correlation among repeated measures, logistic regression or longitudinal data analysis models such as generalized estimating equation or generalized linear mixed models may be used for the analyses. However, these analysis models are often based on the logit link which results in parameter estimates and comparisons in the log-odds ratio scale rather than in the proportion difference scale. A two-step method is proposed in the literature to approximate the calculation of confidence intervals for the proportion difference using a concept of effective sample sizes. However, the performance of this two-step method has not been investigated in their paper. On this note, we examine the properties of the two-step method and propose an adjustment to the effective sample size formula based on Bayesian information theory.

Automated segmentation algorithms based on intensity analysis have been already proposed and recent developments have shown that integrating spatial information enhances automatic image segmentation. However, spatial modeling is often limited to short-range spatial interactions that deal only with noise or small artifacts. Previous tissue alterations (e.g. white matter disease (WMD)) similar in intensity with the lesion of interest require a broader-scale approach to be corrected. On the other hand, imaging techniques offer now a multiparametric voxel characterization that may help differentiating lesioned from non-lesioned voxels. We developed an unsupervised multivariate segmentation algorithm based on finite mixture modeling that incorporates spatial information. We extended the usual spatial Potts model to the regional scale using a 'multi-order' neighborhood potential, with internal adjustment of the regional scale according to the lesion size. We validate the ability of this new algorithm to deal with noise and artifacts (linear and spherical) using artificial data. We then assess its performance on real magnetic resonance imaging brain scans of stroke patients with history of WMD and show that regional regularization was able to remove large-scale WMD artifacts.","inCitations":["a2e30b2a3371a102a6e23cdb9e59041cfdcebf70","6aabe80416786d68961dfc17b1b7f8b637d10483","e7706e6f6895cdee68f47170a720042d3f988178"],"title":"Spatially regularized mixture model for lesion segmentation with application to stroke patients.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv004"}

The targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) is an asymptotically efficient substitution estimator obtained by constructing a so called least favorable parametric submodel through an initial estimator with score, at zero fluctuation of the initial estimator, that spans the efficient influence curve, and iteratively maximizing the corresponding parametric likelihood till no more updates occur, at which point the updated initial estimator solves the so called efficient influence curve equation. In this article we construct a one-dimensional universal least favorable submodel for which the TMLE only takes one step, and thereby requires minimal extra data fitting to achieve its goal of solving the efficient influence curve equation. We generalize these to universal least favorable submodels through the relevant part of the data distribution as required for targeted minimum loss-based estimation. Finally, remarkably, given a multidimensional target parameter, we develop a universal canonical one-dimensional submodel such that the one-step TMLE, only maximizing the log-likelihood over a univariate parameter, solves the multivariate efficient influence curve equation. This allows us to construct a one-step TMLE based on a one-dimensional parametric submodel through the initial estimator, that solves any multivariate desired set of estimating equations.","inCitations":["9de79dc2d0e29a6339b2d70758564691472ae3cb","271043391d9b28842a2f682964a898372ce767c7","9d1297f833c31bc679c0577e4b186e349b100d6a","374c6049634cb0f68e2640f4f1e41fcc1961daf3","41f517c7ac126f86a5946cb80a38c65af752dffb","298b72096b8a770b0cdb263dd53cf2463b8a1a1d","edb794c2503635050e08c532c83fe32c025cb694","a8d96725525660c33256814faad47fe06611b2f1","7a2638b4c8fca41a14a1c69b0dfeda7d1bd4a963","c98890991efb01b3d5095155e65808a2461ce8fe","f54d14af4abf429b7e1ee54058df886fb460ae9b","74e1d237c86cda0fb5bf2a60bb04ebaa40c76771","a1af882b2bf04c87513aa4b3179706b9442bbe80","209928f2019676a868b7f0becd4da023e77a086c","d67ce9df6bb2b1f8aae4a0141c379abdf22263eb","a278c07c8bd2921e59dd862cd91a0540dd340030","9370b27bc8bacbb533a0fbdb6b82d5e4374c076f","fd7d092f01bed73e8dd5fe100efee243e0cc18e8","45f223c8bdbeee57ba5aa56d460b862e17964c13"],"title":"One-Step Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation Based on Universal Least Favorable One-Dimensional Submodels","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0054"}

Despite being central to most statistical procedures, the identifiability of these models has not been studied. In this paper, we partition a family of age-dependent branching processes into equivalence classes over which the distribution of the population size remains identical. This result is applicable to study identifiability of the offspring and lifespan distributions for parametric families of branching processes. For example, we identify classes of Markov processes that are not identifiable. We show that age-dependent processes with (non-exponential) gamma distributed lifespan are identifiable and that Smith-Martin processes are not always identifiable.","inCitations":["8603919c2b8492eb1b7851127dbe71ecd47c6bb0"],"title":"On Classes of Equivalence and Identifiability of Age-dependent Branching Processes.","doi":"10.1239/aap/1409319556"}

Biomarker levels that fall below the assay detection limits (DLs), however, compromise the application of biomarkers in research and practice. Most existing methods to handle non-detects focus on a scenario in which the response variable is subject to detection limit; only a few methods consider explanatory variables when dealing with DLs. We propose a Bayesian approach for generalized linear models with explanatory variables subject to lower, upper, or interval DLs. In simulation studies, we compared the proposed Bayesian approach to four commonly used methods in a logistic regression model with explanatory variable measurements subject to DL. We also applied the Bayesian approach and other four methods in a real study, in which a panel of cytokine biomarkers was studied for their association with acute lung injury (ALI). We found that IL8 was associated with a moderate increase in risk for ALI in the model based on the proposed Bayesian approach.","inCitations":["5e2ae179119b8d2e0c5cbbad248f2e3b750247a1","7ead72d09467f31543803bc821662eedae495da6","5e6bea301eb21f3e3d7c6d8b18a55fbaf672e821","4fae2ae04a46b9da040aaa3c79ec55a410249440","7f47a88e77e3ac24fb9f37aee2cbd5bd145c3e9b","281af9164588d8ad8e61d0677d49e0368aa6f8c9"],"title":"A Bayesian Approach for Generalized Linear Models with Explanatory Biomarker Measurement Variables Subject to Detection Limit - an Application to Acute Lung Injury.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2012.681362"}
