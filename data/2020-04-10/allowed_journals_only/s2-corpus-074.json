These models can accommodate discrete or continuous treatments, as well as treatment effect heterogeneity (causal effect modification). The literature on estimation of MSM parameters has been dominated by semiparametric estimation methods, such as inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW). Likelihood-based methods have received little development, probably in part due to the need to integrate out confounders from the likelihood and due to reluctance to make parametric modeling assumptions. In this article we develop a fully Bayesian MSM for continuous and survival outcomes. In particular, we take a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) approach, using a combination of a dependent Dirichlet process and Gaussian process to model the observed data. The BNP approach, like semiparametric methods such as IPTW, does not require specifying a parametric outcome distribution. Moreover, by using a likelihood-based method, there are potential gains in efficiency over semiparametric methods. An additional advantage of taking a fully Bayesian approach is the ability to account for uncertainty in our (uncheckable) identifying assumption. To this end, we propose informative prior distributions that can be used to capture uncertainty about the identifying \"no unmeasured confounders\" assumption. Thus, posterior inference about the causal effect parameters can reflect the degree of uncertainty about this assumption. The performance of the methodology is evaluated in several simulation studies. The results show substantial efficiency gains over semiparametric methods, and very little efficiency loss over correctly specified maximum likelihood estimates. The method is also applied to data from a study on neurocognitive performance in HIV-infected women and a study of the comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive drug classes.","inCitations":["05e86eac0217e7dc17e69abb67c48b35cf87738e","5e7c4b544e5908b923e434e04a84a4df898686f1","3f7783ac62d2685d21b96950a9c2a595e4dd7485","857406fd4ec90e9f798e2b060f3b8807d5d8b708","5cc8bb722a7dffa5353c646fc8f4429cfbd2e512","f0cdd98cfdd9fa4b7fa4dd67b561cbac6654d0cb","f1156617f6228f4715a728d31e7b01c19145f474","cf783ec806f4267070e279e0a703ff32a7ed121b","a5a30c2b7166f2d204e3ba693854ef3c5eb0b81e","b66f028b64caaf028c593a17fa90308aca16029f","ee698a29c0cfbf145f265f2eccc5ecbb041b9224"],"title":"A Bayesian nonparametric approach to marginal structural models for point treatments and a continuous or survival outcome.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw029"}

Empirical likelihood as a nonparametric approach has been demonstrated to have many desirable merits thanks to its robustness against model misspecification. However, the linear regression model with right censored data cannot directly benefit from the empirical likelihood for inferences mainly due to dependent elements in estimating equations of the conventional approach. In this paper, we propose an empirical likelihood approach with a new estimating equation for linear regression with right censored data. A nested coordinate algorithm with majorization is used for solving the optimization problems with nondifferentiable objective function. We show that the Wilks theorem holds for the new empirical likelihood. We also consider the variable selection problem with empirical likelihood when the number of predictors can be large. Since the new estimating equation is nondifferentiable, a quadratic approximation is applied to study the asymptotic properties of penalized empirical likelihood. We prove the oracle properties and evaluate the properties with simulated data. We apply our method to a SEER small intestine cancer dataset.","inCitations":["09720572a04ed39f3e4166a2b3b55e01d6559536","11b05f4de8d1f33859b0261b2632402147213066"],"title":"Empirical Likelihood for Censored Linear Regression and Variable Selection.","doi":"10.1111/sjos.12137"}

The robust T-optimality method provided adequate power irrespective of which model was true. The robust T-optimality method appears to have useful properties for nonlinear models, where both the parameter values and model structure are required to be known a priori, and the most likely model that would be applied to any new experiment is not known with certainty.","inCitations":["2edf252d108fa30e9d36e20335f40d34267fe831","b3ba245ea1c080fdba1949403298326b5be6eb76","f541e75ec5fc20138f8300feede64f59b95aee9b","87bc1ec779d77eb5e61ef22ee22c56f098af26df","626feeec8dca2cbd985baf0ffdbf9300d503d1f8","64722e22b91e0b3d52edd590582351fb4cd5eb25","95169360ef1df9dc606190e4b8c8fa0836d24c93","efe7bd3cbc94f27ec69bede0e5d5d2945a7442ed","16af2c32f4f26cd0be27432a3486d477017c0348","f2170545e5bd5c80119293df12462d869d88a203"],"title":"A generalisation of T-optimality for discriminating between competing models with an application to pharmacokinetic studies.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1542"}

Methods designed for clustering optimize a global partition of the graph, whereas projection-based approaches (e.g., the latent space model in the statistics literature) represent in rich detail the roles of individuals. Many pertinent questions in sociology and economics, however, span multiple scales of analysis. Further, many questions involve comparisons across disconnected graphs that will, inevitably be of different sizes, either due to missing data or the inherent heterogeneity in real-world networks. We propose a class of network models that represent network structure on multiple scales and facilitate comparison across graphs with different numbers of individuals. These models differentially invest modeling effort within subgraphs of high density, often termed communities, while maintaining a parsimonious structure between said subgraphs. We show that our model class is projective, highlighting an ongoing discussion in the social network modeling literature on the dependence of inference paradigms on the size of the observed graph. We illustrate the utility of our method using data on household relations from Karnataka, India.

The additivity properties of networks make it possible to consider the model as a univariate (multiple) linear regression problem with positivity restrictions on the parameters. In the present study, both theoretical and empirical standard errors are obtained for the constrained regression parameters of a network model with known features. The performance of both types of standard error is evaluated using Monte Carlo techniques.","inCitations":["630453c9e90a8d051723d50ea691de2cac7d15c4","d8e1b39cb15e8ca6691df8cb0bdb01f66c1c6a77","1dc9d3fd498d30cb5cca9a2d26f57a3c9460a323","43c58bf30ff4390ef03e12765f07373f51f766e8","38b40010890ddddaabdc4f37e4dc8196bb2f2a14","8253e5da708b4b95b423d535f27edeb699b2ebb1","a33d972549dc72f8b2fbad303b0c74d4d8307444","fb76fef8751495907af64cbcaa20a7dde31d1a15","a79be23e1d905caed7e096dab7527d3575286871","45d11680e755e48463f01c9dd78e3bd7effb6cac","55d9a268239da45f3f49a8cc020b6840824a5e97","6113a225c1c39607ff404722a8845df9d0097212","13af6363cd4bbad7ec3d697bfb7f5e3ef39e66e2","858e9c9b7e7e97ba0f8f11a1cc6123140c1f0b04","9c67d198e687251d76157274af1b53b59f853734","ad0ce7fa97f895a918909e7a997e3e7d6e689f08","7e9f50ef165699acf6167deb728b249e25a39d2f","0301cd8585a2f0e1f7e7bbe595ee55308f6dc59e","8bf03227ebbe3a378f9538cc3bb0e18c31604879","4fc82c888e46a35c258e27306984dc4eea901012","4f7cfdfd676a7dc4084c59231db11718120405b4","9fbcdc0e53e3dbbe124c8acc5bc8a3ef166133bb","c8cc97ed174ce62e9cc2e0f0ec692b178584d2f8","357244425e2e3e6de438a73898ede5948e428277","4d1dc4741e17fc5e312397fe8010c52f0e1db1b6","240b47f80e98b8043e1369df74342e60aaf93e34","404f1a33e78836ad45aea123c8e36b2585f9ebc8"],"title":"Estimating standard errors in feature network models.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X64240"}

Researchers such as Stricker (1993) and Livingston and Rupp (2004) found that the difference in performance between the subgroups often varies over the different subtests. We suggest a method to examine whether the knowledge of the subgroup membership of the examinees leads to a better estimation of the true subscores.

In many psychological applications, however, such data sets are not available. It often cannot even be predicted how many items will be observed, or what exactly they will entail. This paper introduces a similarity measure, called the metric-frequency (MF) measure, that can be applied to such data sets. If it is not known beforehand how many items will be observed, then the number of items actually observed in itself carries information. A typical feature of the MF is that it incorporates such information. The primary purpose of our measure is that it should be pragmatic, widely applicable, and tractable, even if data are complex. The MF generalizes Tversky's set-theoretic measure of similarity to cases where items may be present or absent and at the same time can be numerical as with Shepard's metric measure, but need not be so. As an illustration, we apply the MF to family therapy where it cannot be predicted what issues the clients will raise in therapy sessions. The MF is flexible enough to be applicable to idiographic data.","inCitations":["eb7e8d0a601b0d6711f62d1905c53e220532f615","bc685f6d7dad2ffa96a35e8eebb5235e6153ea50","fffed4db60dac6bc7955c1e478ca3007dab8b5e3"],"title":"The metric-frequency measure of similarity for ill-structured data sets, with an application to family therapy.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X376070"}

Likelihood methods are used to (1) evaluate and combine the evidence from historical trials to define the non-inferiority margin, (2) assess and report the smallest non-inferiority margin supported by the data, and (3) assess potential violations of the constancy assumption. Data from six aspirin-controlled trials for acute coronary syndrome and data from an active-controlled trial for acute coronary syndrome, Organisation to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS-2) trial, are used for illustration. The likelihood framework offers important theoretical and practical advantages when measuring the strength of evidence in non-inferiority trials. Besides eliminating the influence of sample spaces and prior probabilities on the 'strength of evidence in the data', the likelihood approach maintains good frequentist properties. Violations of the constancy assumption can be assessed in the likelihood framework when it is appropriate to assume a unifying regression model for trial data and a constant control effect including a control rate parameter and a placebo rate parameter across historical placebo controlled trials and the non-inferiority trial. In situations where the statistical non-inferiority margin is data driven, lower likelihood support interval limits provide plausibly conservative candidate margins.","inCitations":["32232707e3b85379136519b0b53c6997f96620f6","07ceb43c7ec0b4898c53d59e77f425eab0bc8bd1","2c4352ac34287cb11e56c54c8d8d8e6fd53f7455","6bfbb8a853f89be07886cf7aecc868c83efe67a7","00dbe9af5fa031bf38808dd9f03abfee3de0fb4f","728873fde3a8ce7ae8d7620b8c823fadba9f6b5f"],"title":"An evidential approach to non-inferiority clinical trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.513"}

We focus on procedures based on marginal p-values; extensions to procedures that exploit the joint distribution of the p-values are also noted. Clinical trial examples are used to illustrate the procedures and their important properties.","inCitations":["7aaa0c07faae8274a8335452f9e7d67ec6706dae","38b06f8ab0536a7e5966dc85d53ea24e4e56367d","5acd49599bb54abf1fa6d6867744e8ef17094f9a","8f0c0356a3a1f663b06d83d5a847e0a8d1662f6c","73df7ed8675538f5145d7f77b3902fc7d9516863","b886933918dd08a61e5095bf50c17c0152e6447d","9ddc221865f1dd90ab38ab633228eb6d2703679b","7bebae11f4d5c3e4bd9f1ae413b548097dce16d7","c1765f963ffc8a08bb8ed96783c1553ec8e85326","138d91d4b4aa56f3ea016f94d9e121adc14cf8f1","f2dd08ea7391473a173a9dab867b06de5e1b0a7c","8222d63e9b0e5dc1bc1bc29e7dbb7437c6eda6bd","512614cd03f38e47ff84880b1d8122ba52c3cbc2","65e7317c8882c9daee8f04b5eda09c8d4ade5ca7","1bca754938ef05dfba1673c34c3c82279884bcaf","5d2842542150f5c1c01dc65f0770cb1f851032c0","b3684ea6ce89063f70e8bda3d09e469d0248622c","944d174f82ef2cf003b8e0ca76e709c327d77327","087572034bc8c83750c2ed55d6ef67b9bfba122a","67371563920b834061478a8435def96cd2e9af63","70f9f1f7ccd246d5df37adba50f726faf73981d5","c7912d650b6fe98787ca6c52edc24d008f5b355a","3891adc5a439349e05bff78a9a5aa71b3df5cccb","780b29f931b7323929f52f50ae170f35dde53a9d","c454ab77482ffe18d1a48fcb82c5a2c1c76ccf59","09a77b51af5de428e1a8addda7e046a1ae6fb0a7","1086643c453895287174269eb2121491ef270c75","7dda262e052bd6f4ad3743d7fda8c9d8200268c1","179d7b170048360a00877b55f9b8073ae1143009","47e5c4d980c81687ae00901c0b361f6bc13c6ef5","30fefe75fccbb8fa20cacdc5f59117dfeb150ca8","681ea803d2cb7fd3be834725500c128a83d9f1d3","507f6e8bc1697edfe343c586bc2910388d22a573","8961ce903ddbaf41999daf0e27a503850db2fc42","f31cd19acb93ff9e54129182e071861d67257944","c404a4a12509bb24f4f0a9c5e9cae2b0af1c2aaa","253808051e92e1f485e3b79d03a09d904e3a761f","0458dacae2e4270e345734da5f902de270931705","a59c710915a46134efe9e2a4120573168363e44b","edeb7e2b20cecac3459f8ad61a9b09ba1499549a","6baf472370d4357375602fd21cc188abace6e980","9e5d85f9bbec73f86201e7e634a6f47a05afa17a","b73918710de8700e847e69374f90660db877668d","5169721efbe314fc739504083259d06e1ce4ca0c","b003e37a1dcdc223956dedde08d89858653b8cc3","370f0486099e9bf8e9b2a7d8a964a47c1dcc43fe","f7f903447114b8c27cc9df757b5a1989900b2c60","5253654da2e98165c14c75895ebaa4fcecb9bdd6"],"title":"Gatekeeping procedures with clinical trial applications.","doi":"10.1002/pst.291"}

The special cases of weighted kappa, for example Cohen's kappa, are chance-corrected measures of association. For various measures of 2 × 2 association it has been observed in the literature that, after correction for chance, they coincide with a special case of weighted kappa. This paper presents the general function, linear in both numerator and denominator, that becomes weighted kappa after correction for chance.","inCitations":["9de7b8099d25126253b33b3fa9bf61d0ff311f6b","f11f7ffc6c23b02d50e4240278a1adb47c5ae232","9a427c7299f8717aa132f4b2ccdce9fd6b360d3a","82efe60efa89b1d8ea5f18c9e7fbb36829a4e2d5","aa2c50398344887acb9775b16d25e46616947541","0559946e5879d7a6ead91da7baeeaf013ad90bc7","7acd87730c484f036324afdf76158fc8e8498a22"],"title":"Chance-corrected measures for 2 × 2 tables that coincide with weighted kappa.","doi":"10.1348/2044-8317.002001"}
