We suggest that before the relative merits of various methods can be evaluated, we must state what we assume an assessment of QT prolongation should be about. As a general framework for the assessment of QT prolongation we propose that an assessment of \"absolute\" or \"uncorrected\" QT prolongation is properly carried out through a between-treatment (active versus placebo) comparison of the marginal distributions of QT data; an assessment of \"heart rate corrected\" QT prolongation is carried out through a between-treatment comparison of the conditional distributions of QT data (conditional on RR interval or heart rate). Under this general framework, conditional QT prolongation is, in general, a function of RR interval, and we discuss three possible summary characteristics for that function. We show how current procedures for the assessment of QT prolongation relate to the general approach (that is, to between-treatment contrasts of the marginal and conditional expectation of the QT interval), and to each other. It transpires that only the so-called \"one-step procedure\" can provide a complete characterization of conditional QT prolongation. We show that the \"two-step procedure\" with data-driven correction provides an unbiased estimate of expected conditional QT prolongation, which may, from a clinical point of view, be a more satisfactory characteristic than the conventional characteristic, QT prolongation at the reference RR interval. We strongly suggest that two-step procedures with fixed correction be abandoned in the analysis of thorough QT/QTc studies: Fixed correction is either redundant (when a drug has no effect on average RR interval), or systematically biased (when a drug does affect average RR interval).","inCitations":["1831e070cbf3b7031162ca36ef58de7d5d636a97","114c911eb669955376ee32f11dd74dcb9fbbeee8"],"title":"Statistical characterization of QT prolongation.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903581978"}

The proposed method is fast, distribution-free, and well approximates the nominal significance level.

Large commercial interests will inevitably set off international competition among major pharmaceutical companies. The European Union, the United States, and other countries with advanced medical techniques have paid a high degree of attention to biological similarity (biosimilarity) for drug development and market management and have started to take corresponding measures. Because of the diverse definitions of biosimilarity between countries, which can determine whether the medicines on sale are in the review of the base grant, the competent authority will also encounter varying degrees of standards. Governments should review the corresponding guidelines as soon as possible because many countries around the world have actively amended the law in response to management need of biological similarity. The similarity of biological drugs should be assessed by clinical trial under current regulations. Pharmaceutical companies try to lower the cost of generic drugs to increase the competitiveness of their products. To reduce the number of subjects in the clinical trials for development of generic drugs, we refer to the clinical trial for evaluation of bridging studies. Hsiao et al. (2007) has proposed the use of Bayes method in evaluation of bridging studies. Prior information on the original region is used to reduce the number of subjects to lower the cost of biosimilar drug development. Take the results of the approval biologics as a priori information, and the information is appropriate to be embedded into the model evaluating the similar products in order to reduce the sample size required for the assessment of the test sample.","inCitations":["3485c87ea4c014b50e93759f1e9f021421a083d6"],"title":"Applications of the bayesian prior information to evaluation of equivalence of similar biological medicinal products.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.941982"}

Robust measurements on the probability of success (POS) of a study are crucial in the decision-making process. Among many factors that can affect the POS, establishment of the statistical alternative hypothesis (H(1)) is arguably the most important consideration. The classical power is universally used for assessing the probability of H(1) being accepted, given a certain value of the parameter of interest. If H(1) is composite, power is often provided for a range of plausible values of the parameter to reflect our uncertainty about the parameter. This could become inconvenient for decision makers and potentially introduce biases into the decision-making process. This paper proposes an extension of Bayesian expected power (eBEP) as a single metric for assessing POS defined as the probability that H(1) is accepted in a study as a tool for decision-making. eBEP is convenient, driven by scientific evidence, and systematically integrates the uncertainty, thus facilitates robust decision-making. The computation procedure of eBEP via Monte Carlo methods is provided. The application of eBEP is illustrated using a real-life bioequivalence study.","inCitations":["b8aedd0dc1cb88cfd4bd4cf1e52187166e606ea7","e7ffbcf891eed7e4cef0ff07bbf6664af6c610d9"],"title":"An extension of Bayesian expected power and its application in decision making.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003618967"}

A collection of methods and models has been developed in recent years to determine if amino acid sites in a given DNA sequence alignment display substitutions that are altering or conserving a prespecified set of amino acid properties. Residues showing an elevated number of substitutions that favorably alter a physicochemical property are considered targets of positive natural selection. Such approaches usually perform independent analyses for each amino acid property under consideration, without taking into account the fact that some of the properties may be highly correlated. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical regression model with latent factor structure that allows us to determine which sites display substitutions that conserve or radically change a set of amino acid properties, while accounting for the correlation structure that may be present across such properties.

Imputation for the missing values is common, but can supply only an approximate result desired to be \"close enough\" to the intended true result. Prevention optimally addresses the issue. Knowledge of the effective techniques to minimize the problem, likely to vary with clinical setting, is presently inadequate. Formal evaluation of preventative methods should be encouraged and lead to publication of the assessments. Designers of clinical trials should also plan for study analysis where missing values occur. Simple imputation methods have been used and may be sufficient in some settings, but have potential to introduce bias and inaccuracy into the statistical analysis. More complex methods such as multiple imputation potentially offer reduced risk of bias. Multiple imputation also offers the potential for study designers to include some auxiliary outcome assessments that may substantially improve the quality of the imputation with limited added burden to the study. In all cases, sensitivity analyses examining the importance of the specific preferred method as compared to methods with different underlying assumptions is essential to assessing how adequately the missing data issue has been addressed.","inCitations":["3837a0b4cc64aa2ef3d3286bf6566cb7ceb2d91c","52fc5a78163379c0b170ad58434488534899c2f9","9c7744547a04562c4351795219fec384d0664b7e","5a51debe4c5cad51bf653b33a63124d952877125","e8408d97d1306a04fd22d7169afca7bf73941a3c","d3b555a3c6d2b310cd4061b9fe1b9957785ab105","f0b02bb2483932e3a79806c9e78660d4624f71d3","c2d272c1feb290c7f0b4e31f2914580ed86b2967"],"title":"Addressing and advancing the problem of missing data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903238959"}

However, a subtle and often overlooked point is that valid inference requires the mean for the response at time t to be expressed properly as a function of the complete past, present, and future values of any time-varying covariate. For example, with environmental exposures it may be necessary to express the response as a function of multiple lagged values of the covariate series. Despite the fact that multiple lagged covariates may be predictive of outcomes, researchers often focus interest on parameters in a 'cross-sectional' model, where the response is expressed as a function of a single lag in the covariate series. Cross-sectional models yield parameters with simple interpretations and avoid issues of collinearity associated with multiple lagged values of a covariate. Pepe and Anderson (1994), showed that parameter estimates for time-varying covariates may be biased unless the mean, given all past, present, and future covariate values, is equal to the cross-sectional mean or unless independence estimating equations are used. Although working independence avoids potential bias, many authors have shown that a poor choice for the response correlation model can lead to highly inefficient parameter estimates. The purpose of this paper is to study the bias-efficiency trade-off associated with working correlation choices for application with binary response data. We investigate data characteristics or design features (e.g. cluster size, overall response association, functional form of the response association, covariate distribution, and others) that influence the small and large sample characteristics of parameter estimates obtained from several different weighting schemes or equivalently 'working' covariance models. We find that the impact of covariance model choice depends highly on the specific structure of the data features, and that key aspects should be examined before choosing a weighting scheme.","inCitations":["cf0ac13c93c7ffddf01deeb27e5fd4429d8abdbb","9af84701233c0b2a1a49086d97eb062d2f726aec","e4657ebefec98af64b46d23a5d272994dbd2de4f","4492066d3f86e997f28d45a7c6c12189c43eac70","657e6dfeec1034bf31a3d95bb1ce3c0308aa5bd4","e0ccded71a98abeb8840d44e30ef71b5edf8969d","03c0f8fae79a26d9291a7b61d0b1485cb3faeb4d","01f331dce8ebe9afa5d0f14ca4023d7e457c664b","a13bb65b7814fa606c152a325e81d9fec26147e5","b9c918977527274cfbcf8a5e3a52aa90648bb77a","14de791ee63f8afde0206eb68a85e17fdbb9451e","6606fbd8cb3b3ecfcaf0208db36e5aa9ec3277af","6d14b6ee8f22752ac7240e944d975344f4f2b58b","a509b3b26dcb5a4483635c11224736ae0b888abc","3a061a45068b1f9dfdaad1a37ff19f3ee1d0285e","e0b3eaefc9abf24e5b6f247b84e1a6f1283b618a","16486139709ded34557b7092990a61543850a06c","1299e87ffeaac18deef4fd8f49974c5462257b4c","322f5db36f92ae2957d340481446d2b81f7485b8","6de683e4d9dac0aa9f4e9aa79e8aeb5ab88f3810","c6358de4ba5e62292e1124e12d5dce352ba285b5","ad445d384928f50dca4a8031365157d9331ceefd","016a6c920d0cc1fba497c3222889d8ccf706ac15","a336b774f7ca77639875171af6e870c194d84aaa","9e05659b1517256dd7b7a2685153ba5121134696","e500a83ed73e0f7966d2292865385ce2bdc60958","0c9444b6907c9259b24007afc51c022a81ced95f","22961171a8911770fef87a2928c6724613d74249","0e8e4604f465818085533a2d4479f57d8354d460","9709fd1b3bdb1ab79c2662aeb49a42dd54e9998e","01976427a0af34c822cd59b75740720ca8c154a6","66629e26037eceee48594ebe4ba4462e8ac4a807","a3c8d5676781030c056588c9e963bd9874d115a4","121e0c960d00c7a9c6ae59f8f099d98870b9e831","efe989d5f865d8f23e4b7d835b01df193351f3d4","a8c4bdcd7fdd139343b76aca7a95416162df6161","13b25d381efec6847f91d6d8ca274cde805d2390","356467eeac91ddd6cc7bbc67a66d688990490a5f","f34ee1cc3d14927ab067997df596b6b7894a8a14","cb324cb2cb25ecae555962372725f35b2d5d38a5"],"title":"Regression analysis of longitudinal binary data with time-dependent environmental covariates: bias and efficiency.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi033"}

To minimize bias, we propose a doubly randomized delayed-start design for clinical trials with enrichment. The design consists of two periods. In the first period, patients can be randomized to receive several doses of a new drug or a control. In the second period, control patients of the first period of an enriched population can be rerandomized to receive the same or fewer doses of the new drug or to continue on the control. Depending on the clinical needs, different randomization ratios can be applied to the two periods. The essential feature is that the design is naturally adaptive because of the randomization for the second period. As a result, other aspects of the second period, such as the sample size, can be modified adaptively when an interim analysis is set up for the first period. At the end of the trial, response data from both randomizations are combined in an integrated analysis. Because of the enrichment in the second period, the design increases the probability of trial success and, in addition, reduces the required sample size. Thus, for clinical development, the design offers greater efficiency.","inCitations":["c6a07c0fd055d89c83d19c756c7c2f9e9e402d4f","b920d61a3ab10c4fbf2f123dd93cb19a9c3872f9","e8c9fcc3d2e45cdab95fee81a07d344add1b4e4e","6e31d8eb7b82752ca052a6eb7402494b4b7c6f32"],"title":"Doubly randomized delayed-start design for enrichment studies with responders or nonresponders.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.678234"}

Unlike model-based adjustments, in matching a patient remains intact as a single patient, and may be scrutinized as an individual and thickly described. A thick description entails a detailed, perhaps narrative, account of a patient's care, for instance, the account one might find in the 'Case Reports from the Massachusetts General Hospital' as published in the New England Journal of Medicine. While discussing certain principles of thick description, we illustrate using data from the pilot for a case-control study of the causes of death following surgery. Matching is based on billing data from Medicare, and the medical charts of matched pairs are then abstracted. In the pilot, we matched cases and controls in one hospital, located and scrutinized their medical charts. As a consequence, we corrected our misinterpretations of aspects of Medicare billing data, thereby improving the matching for the full study. Also, looking at charts suggested topics for investigation and helped us understand the types of information we might reliably find in charts, and this reshaped our plans for chart abstraction. Our central claim is that, unlike other methods of adjustment, matching facilitates thick description of a handful of cases, and such scrutiny of cases benefits statistical studies at several stages. Thick description of a few matched cases is used repeatedly to improve the matching and to design further data collection for the matched sample. Thick description aids matching by providing close examination of what the matching has actually accomplished, an examination that uses much more information than is available for use in matching. Matching aids thick description by placing side by side two patients who are fairly comparable, so that a thick description of them may usefully be performed.","inCitations":["0ce46b8a32cc13e49bd4a069d582acf41ab03991","9f22d6a45a1ba902f3fd5ed2f34a9bd21b794934","315462b852258ab17d240194165a10af18275d3e","634ca771f5e4b77f1fb17dd25d91b7650520a95d","b9528ec250744b55dc86ade5330636253447599d","84f66377327465c1e0d1857ad8c7c0f53d4130a1","bdb7561699cd712b656b257bb1475db22d1ed77d","f5039256fab63480803f609d7f2c7e7eb3adf864","6156f34fc28fab052ec2cd852c80f88b7a13bcb8","4daca7705bff9300d04b154a8eb89bee66fe5bea","8db91a245918779ece3af835412771755a2f1eae","7ff9124c7427e6404cd6dbd27cbed8cef666b8f1","b7cc143b190e47eb67f82a0e8ab5501bf7c169a3","8d6625b5d16f30dc70496bee4aee96de3838a905","f3a2b7f8b63c09083506b6fc065592627abe3c1f","8ca21226398fe0ba830b5aff9df9cc04ffcca1bd","ee93ded3735f5d40030efc13cf252528006a92d5","79d001cb8422d987186ff321e6ef907b71f2bfcf","ef23fa2eaaacc0946e6bcb643f393864ddda17f6","7055db0725de5df2454d4da33ef027888a783d7d","4689d2d860350b2ec7be4ed97ae6d55a7d043e7b","ecc28d4a3f8b98b698961d590fd9496d3bea2c42","82d0a6781805b98c003c3e4bf2fa7cbd501ebd80","454e956da91137e88a86e3587f137f1cda930ac4","1f0362525a7f9504571b576c242a90fd0c4a3e6a","9bad2189218e2806e6888ec4cbca42197d55ca8c","2828ce99723e141e60398a2bbabfaaec58898033","eb5711c71c9d755f082ba7b0a9b44608bc99b5fd","83ec7f129884e672cb4f05de868fc8227ae0e395","eca13a34d86b198fbbaac8cb00a8c7ea7c8d0849","d0bbc642c79719ebad1d1da8aadeda06e0b1cc7a","7c25e261edc615dfc376f3e28f56065c3821a821","9c496f52cce1df01e62494eae6eb336eebd91b51"],"title":"Matching and thick description in an observational study of mortality after surgery.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/2.2.217"}

We show that this concept can be easily adapted to high-dimensional observations and, in particular, to gene expression data. This allows the development of the following depth-based inference tools: (1) a scale curve for measuring and visualizing the dispersion of a set of points, (2) a rank test for deciding if 2 groups of multidimensional observations come from the same population, and (3) supervised classification techniques for assigning a new sample to one of G given groups. We apply these methods to microarray data, and to simulated data including contaminated models, and show that they are robust, efficient, and competitive with other procedures proposed in the literature, outperforming them in some situations.","inCitations":["e8d1119b7751dd181ad4f2756d841d17d6094f84","cc658e687586a00a2a894e4462e878b3a6da1f8b","71f71a2ad3e6ed96e5868d0812ffb5cee4232be4","98d0b768fd9a4a85cba4b53e2f7a7a3c5b8bfb2b","737497e768abb2c49988489e5394f7c033f46500","b90e69564f1d741b1501360e7b1665a99e1982bf","5d965d1aeca1c2732141a83c0de56d138a4761df","46373cd256894d7bd61b80f3ad640b2bd3ff51cf","c69f1e1a5872f2d739c39cef6883bafa33aac97f","a842b8979d228f55caf75dc53c23bf8c75b31f60","9f22e9f719ee58b102afa3622bccfbd91d76ecb2","e28ada4b3976e7e6d88d14dadde293bf771935a6","683dc773153907f225f37370fb26633695036287"],"title":"Robust depth-based tools for the analysis of gene expression data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp056"}

Recently, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called for research quantifying health effects of simultaneous exposure to many air pollutants. However, straightforward application of HM in this context is challenged by the need to specify a random-effect distribution on a high-dimensional vector of nuisance parameters. Here we introduce reduced HM as a general statistical approach for analyzing correlated data with many nuisance parameters. For reduced HM we first calculate the integrated likelihood of the parameter of interest (e.g. excess number of deaths attributed to simultaneous exposure to high levels of many pollutants), and we then specify a flexible random-effect distribution directly on this parameter. Simulation studies show that the reduced HM performs comparably to the full HM in many scenarios, and even performs better in some cases, particularly when the multivariate random-effect distribution of the full HM is misspecified. Methods are applied to estimate relative risks of cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with simultaneous exposure to elevated levels of particulate matter and ozone in 51 US counties during 1999-2005.","inCitations":["6d11ec4eebf32f05e1bcfa12de2fb51012ef35e1","6526a94d1002785113b9d5283e7c5df38fc918b7","8081326137fa8b3b0ce61e87d80347d77b983c4c","8f1f66f5fd33a44806893894b1a0b834240663c3","bca0db1f8f75891a1ec302ab0252439ef92c38ea","24908a378d2accce97bd03f28fa2a11348eb2385","a92a089b550dc45d16aefc2d23e1b2780f7386f5","3879119aca96c104c081dfeb8dd59351d6a6650e","ac5aa97f008b4d3631e6992fd3493ca5abb66337","ac98f34dc5de02f677705663a1b4d327a95622d6","1963c6a22664d3772d5d8b30de70c564d223c7b4","5a7a94656bc41df881029b62eac2aa8358b456d2"],"title":"Reduced hierarchical models with application to estimating health effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple pollutants.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12006"}

In this paper, we propose a method for identifying activity types, like walking, standing, and resting, from acceleration data. Our approach decomposes movements into short components called \"movelets\", and builds a reference for each activity type. Unknown activities are predicted by matching new movelets to the reference. We apply our method to data collected from a single, three-axis accelerometer and focus on activities of interest in studying physical function in elderly populations. An important technical advantage of our methods is that they allow identification of short activities, such as taking two or three steps and then stopping, as well as low frequency rare(compared with the whole time series) activities, such as sitting on a chair. Based on our results we provide simple and actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of large epidemiological studies that could collect accelerometry data for the purpose of predicting the time series of activities and connecting it to health outcomes.","inCitations":["0f33d8fc84851c90764b33c863fbd206d7d2ea58","44eea6dfefb842698c971068e3701f2a09f75b54","2ff2a5035839e1019fdcef6596fb56ef63e9f328","cf1c185cb06c6a211c489d02043654b36753013f","672af672c6ad7d2b739d921a5606504abf57a71d","d03b5090b2cdca7a710125a744933c8b941a434c","3fe24d6d95b680e14579de89db87619faa16a536","a4333299de0c7b57ce4b21c83cddf3434cdfc8c8","1decef8112bbf38be1d296a132da391a9f8142cb","a4857e5dae3ef0fb3eacbe27d1a842b2bf807301","fbc921b038665cda32b49e42936310431374f168","e879020aafd7bc59bbd80d287f897a1a7f6bf967","cd64bfee5c008c1d96b3d0e440ef94270f50fe5f","b7a615fdb10ccedb13a50a08f1786a43313c14f5","44281980fec1ae274c43c489e840f2cc94696b3c","986177d99df25ef82303e71f54f08eff046ae349","c88a676743abd642d18b63e74de4f057b6173d9d","e9956227c29460d03bf349d632bbab5894a303c5"],"title":"Movelets: A dictionary of movement.","doi":"10.1214/12-EJS684"}

Of these influential factors, the test-reference ratio exhibits the largest impact on the statistical power of a pilot trial, followed by intrasubject variability, sample sizes of pivotal trials, and sample sizes of pilot trials. The sample sizes that are used in pilot trials (8-12 subjects) may be sufficient for test products with low intrasubject variability and true ratio close to 1 and may fall short otherwise.","inCitations":["60ee5dfabac5938ce4a3e1d6d1e2be7107be55be","2d9ec8d86713be9cb29f267e196e3adf422f5059"],"title":"Pilot trial for the assessment of relative bioavailability in generic drug product development: statistical power.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101007"}

Computational statistics","paperAbstract":"We focus upon flexible Bayesian hierarchical models for scientific data available at geo-coded locations. Investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models to analyze such datasets. These models are customarily estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which have become especially popular for spatial modeling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible otherwise. However, estimating Bayesian spatial process models is undermined by prohibitive computational expenses associated with parameter estimation. Classes of low-rank spatial process models are increasingly being deployed to resolve this problem by projecting spatial effects to a lower-dimensional subspace. We discuss how a low-rank process called the ‘predictive process’ seamlessly enters the hierarchical modeling framework and helps us accrue substantial computational benefits.
