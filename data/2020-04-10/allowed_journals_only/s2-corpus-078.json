This difficulty has led to the development of the proportional subdistribution hazards model. If the covariate is known at baseline, the model allows for a summarizing assessment in terms of the cumulative incidence function. black Mathematically, the model also allows for including random time-dependent covariates, but practical implementation has remained unclear due to a certain risk set peculiarity. We use the intimate relationship of discrete covariates and multistate models to naturally treat time-dependent covariates within the subdistribution hazards framework. The methodology then straightforwardly translates to real-valued time-dependent covariates. As with classical survival analysis, including time-dependent covariates does not result in a model for probability functions anymore. Nevertheless, the proposed methodology provides a useful synthesis of separate cause-specific hazards analyses. We illustrate this with hospital infection data, where time-dependent covariates and competing risks are essential to the subject research question.","inCitations":["87791da9c634fcde15bf780546478220579b41a7","ab56943b810c3df733c1c0bd883ab662d08f130f","8d1bc4f9b4ed813ccea76e45508cc523bd9d8994","f6ae94b832ff3640447d3ebe183eb7e80602b365","077b846d571f94bfef404ad66c41decaa496a8b4","522c543822088b24f4bb7d2e74ccf4ef4b5bcf92","152c56405ec3e2de0abef8bc8e1b9d6fc06a9664","3525cd55ce13ba085429a47e0c900cb04da3964c","deadcc8f7da8db9118c75953d8ccb3f2463cac8a","b60c053cad9404de7d1281555343e74056a69bbd","dc8b5100dbe60656598b0aec52dd49f6c88efdee","772d005857e77473d6c4a430d3a62e56ed78d8a9","ff4e2e46c5492023a34a2a693f7f7101fdf16e3f","bd85058ab4f2538ac398b8902399c5b530f22e5d","9d2266eff4a2975fd02d08a97afac4c63cad6af8","b05b7e0127b99284953740bb597a9e7f4ac5c276","5926f92b9978799b6720d7057525f383940a707b","e7741d4e26aab64f752025df0efe3b9f3467fd20","25f94ce4f0bca76dc3e8e203c0ca0cda31b01ec7","afe14754f5053d6a5e8bec2d6ebcbe94c76bb6bf","d7c434bb3c3c75df8089c22cbaae9b66aa0a4481","45908315eb0267c8b557d342be763656330de755","a89c3ba2becaf3b896b93cfe286862c14b1888c7","bbddda34620c82d01d4dc40358fe9139157ccff4","c723a45750cb8d3a606c0c277210149bbf5e4d39","b52ce1879bd07374475a36e0377ab264ce8cb8ba","0625591e077bf8a3770883c9c853b491febf934b","b3bdfb19910cf52b0588cb931638bfada8e403fa","085803acdd182a96fbdac7588be49abda3302d04","6215a260d9dc5e0e190b5ed2a4bddcb4613844fa","151c65f9b865884bf6fe02c90d552a6c0c0e521e","31c982cb920aa183aba7316c337130013261b336","50752b4e74c3f6f9f7d66640500c28bc19a2f222","bd0484b5efd83aee720fadb826b3467a46bcd090","7ba87c0a95244147d820923264663f00e0ef6133","144980fc8390775d90cc8d0d3c057766ca12c76c","b3f094957fe2a80c6631a2ff8ec69f666065c8ab","74e89cb0580da74403a445c113163ee1aa9e0158","64c4beb8cfa0cb6bb40307697b64dc45e67957a7","e3504bbc664980031666f940d17e5365a4b9a5ec","38747fe45b0b76671506ffd2dfabc0735760ecf9","e8229cc42aa5df625e4c83cadc3993d18ce3b23b","955087f590b0536e42fc8ec7bdb5f77a6e701e3f","040671098b7303a9c02f1b4e5992dfec927169a0","a25c32a08b942f243c9b75b5a9badbb404406b68","42ec8a858304a4ffebe7c1541002f072ba32d5f1","334eb5188fb23deb084cbb8d3e149284f580fa5f","2ca57c99aa9e99f7c4115680a485f7013b30f57a","adc753d57cb0eeee7267397b3b2fd0708108e889","c178586edc5bcb0206f646cf0ddbb4b8674ed9e0","8cfcfc3a3dc36acd21b2172a48cbe035f79980ea","e3b6694eb38cf2e668ae2328cd7b436270d2fff1","17195a9a366a1bebcc75f3b8f6934cc379707e09","4e6783bd25191ccba9e4e44ce7206802605b43fb"],"title":"Time-dependent covariates in the proportional subdistribution hazards model for competing risks.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn009"}

The approach involves fitting bivariate linear mixed-effects models to all the pairwise combinations of responses, where the latter result from the individual coordinate positions, and aggregating the results across repeated parameter estimates (such as the random-effects variance for a particular coordinate). We describe one example using landmarks and another using facial curves from the cleft lip study, the latter using B-splines to provide an efficient parameterization. The results are presented in 2 dimensions, both in the profile and in the frontal views, with bivariate confidence intervals for the mean position of each landmark or curve, allowing objective assessment of significant differences in particular areas of the face between the 2 groups.

The USP monograph sets performance limit on dissolution in terms of a specific percentage Q that the drug product is required to be dissolved at a specified time. Japan Pharmacopoeia provides acceptance rules different from USP. However the objective of the acceptance rules was not defined in terms of the inference of the whole lot by either USP, European Pharmacopoeia (EP) or Japan Pharmacopoeia (JP). The operating characteristics' curves of these rules are all shown to be sensitive to the true mean dissolution and do not reject a lot which has a large percentage of tablets that dissolve with less than the specified limit Q. This is especially true when the mean dissolution is close to the specification value. We proposed that the goal of the dissolution test sampling plan is to accept a lot at least 90% of the tablets dissolved more than a pre-specified amount Q at the specific time. The group sequential procedure derived accordingly is shown to outperform both USP and JP in controlling the type I error rate under normality assumption.","inCitations":["3c284f0dc47836d5881c5b62ebe69c2fa4eadbe9","702a11fff9e3864b461647ed1995d527c52d3aff","35504fbbb48386fea280855dc9f4aa349d71ced8","d9cdcf43e6e0b57907caefeaabacd9ee984609dd","af6648fa7949a309799cee714e9c7db3e790f1f4","ed6d258750df8544a2767e2c17ba9c0e489276cf"],"title":"Three-stage sequential statistical dissolution testing rules.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200025689"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2013,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"A large-sample problem of illustrating noninferiority of an experimental treatment over a referent treatment for binary outcomes is considered. The methods of illustrating noninferiority involve constructing the lower two-sided confidence bound for the difference between binomial proportions corresponding to the experimental and referent treatments and comparing it with the negative value of the noninferiority margin. The three considered methods, Anbar, Falk-Koch, and Reduced Falk-Koch, handle the comparison in an asymmetric way, that is, only the referent proportion out of the two, experimental and referent, is directly involved in the expression for the variance of the difference between two sample proportions. Five continuity corrections (including zero) are considered with respect to each approach. The key properties of the corresponding methods are evaluated via simulations. First, the uncorrected two-sided confidence intervals can, potentially, have smaller coverage probability than the nominal level even for moderately large sample sizes, for example, 150 per group. Next, the 15 testing methods are discussed in terms of their Type I error rate and power. In the settings with a relatively small referent proportion (about 0.4 or smaller), the Anbar approach with Yates' continuity correction is recommended for balanced designs and the Falk-Koch method with Yates' correction is recommended for unbalanced designs. For relatively moderate (about 0.6) and large (about 0.8 or greater) referent proportion, the uncorrected Reduced Falk-Koch method is recommended, although in this case, all methods tend to be over-conservative. These results are expected to be used in the design stage of a noninferiority study when asymmetric comparisons are envisioned.","inCitations":["e11a6eccc24f7509d7ead4492a7d5e215bb51d9c","49cc7f7c8961260a7ffa8d00922dbb867e85f7b4"],"title":"Applications of asymptotic confidence intervals with continuity corrections for asymmetric comparisons in noninferiority trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1566"}

In practice, however, this condition can be easily violated because the follow-up of a study is usually within a finite window. In this article we show that the mean survival time is still estimable from a linear model when the support of some covariate(s) with nonzero coefficient(s) is unbounded regardless of the length of follow-up. This implies that the mean survival time can be well estimated when the support of linear predictor is wide in practice. The theoretical finding is further verified for finite samples by simulation studies. Simulations also show that, when both models are correctly specified, the linear model yields reasonable mean square prediction errors and outperforms the Cox model, particularly with heavy censoring and short follow-up time.","inCitations":["73c6c27185958d90d8065a1f701026cc42d8539b"],"title":"Estimating Mean Survival Time: When Is It Possible?","doi":"10.1111/sjos.12112"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2005,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"This article proposes nonparametric inference procedures for analyzing microarray gene expression data that are reliable, robust, and simple to implement. They are conceptually transparent and require no special-purpose software. The analysis begins by normalizing gene expression data in a unique way. The resulting adjusted observations consist of gene-treatment interaction terms (representing differential expression) and error terms. The error terms are considered to be exchangeable, which is the only substantial assumption. Thus, under a family null hypothesis of no differential expression, the adjusted observations are exchangeable and all permutations of the observations are equally probable. The investigator may use the adjusted observations directly in a distribution-free test method or use their ranks in a rank-based method, where the ranking is taken over the whole data set. For the latter, the essential steps are as follows: (1) Calculate a Wilcoxon rank-sum difference or a corresponding Kruskal-Wallis rank statistic for each gene. (2) Randomly permute the observations and repeat the previous step. (3) Independently repeat the random permutation a suitable number of times. Under the exchangeability assumption, the permutation statistics are independent random draws from a null cumulative distribution function (c.d.f) approximated by the empirical c.d.f Reference to the empirical c.d.f tells if the test statistic for a gene is outlying and, hence, shows differential expression. This feature is judged by using an appropriate rejection region or computing a p-value for each test statistic, taking into account multiple testing. The distribution-free analog of the rank-based approach is also available and has parallel steps which are described in the article. The proposed nonparametric analysis tends to give good results with no additional refinement, although a few refinements are presented that may interest some investigators. The implementation is illustrated with a case application involving differential gene expression in wild-type and knockout mice of an E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin treatment, relative to a baseline untreated condition.","inCitations":["7d5db7347f619ffdb1413c6f0457234ebf6520e2","bd4a11725763658e1667631ede2f81ea11920e77","30bc508338c2d702873cc1ca9de9991d2bba7652"],"title":"Nonparametric methods for microarray data based on exchangeability and borrowed power.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200067778"}

However, the ROM NI test had low power for well-adhering TDS, which were becoming increasingly prevalent. Mathematical proof and simulation revealed that the low power wasn't because the non-normality of adhesion data violated the normality assumption of parametric methods; it was because the ROM NI test was coupled with an adhesion scale where scores approached 0 as adhesion got better. In June 2016, FDA published a draft general guidance on TDS adhesion and recommended a new statistical approach, replacing the ROM NI test with a difference-of-means (DOM) NI test, using the same scale and primary endpoint (mean adhesion scores). An analysis of 40 TDS adhesion studies submitted in ANDAs after the publication of the 2016 draft guidance suggests that, consistent with simulation results, the new statistical approach markedly improves the low power, and thereby reduces the sample size required by the old approach for moderately to well-adhering TDS, while retaining comparable power for poorly adhering TDS. The new statistical approach thus enhances the potential approvability and patient access to well-adhering generic TDS.","inCitations":["b0e94617014bbe099178cfd1eaa58db56948c4ee"],"title":"Statistical considerations and impact of the FDA draft guidance for assessing adhesion with transdermal delivery systems and topical patches for ANDAs.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2019.1657440"}

The parameter expansion not only enables a closed-form solution in the M-step but also improves efficiency. Using the simulation studies, we compare the performance of our approach with the MCEM algorithms developed by Chib and Greenberg (1998) and Song and Lee (2005), as well as the iterative approach proposed by Li and Schafer (2008).

Generally, this target value is estimated through previous data, but the inherent variability in the historical response rate is not taken into account. In this paper, we present a Bayesian procedure to construct single-arm two-stage designs that allows to incorporate uncertainty in the response rate of the standard treatment. In both stages, the sample size determination criterion is based on the concepts of conditional and predictive Bayesian power functions. Different kinds of prior distributions, which play different roles in the designs, are introduced, and some guidelines for their elicitation are described. Finally, some numerical results about the performance of the designs are provided and a real data example is illustrated.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2011,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Computational statistics & data analysis","paperAbstract":"Generalized additive models (GAMs) have distinct advantages over generalized linear models as they allow investigators to make inferences about associations between outcomes and predictors without placing parametric restrictions on the associations. The variable of interest is often smoothed using a locally weighted regression (LOESS) and the optimal span (degree of smoothing) can be determined by minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A natural hypothesis when using GAMs is to test whether the smoothing term is necessary or if a simpler model would suffice. The statistic of interest is the difference in deviances between models including and excluding the smoothed term. As approximate chi-square tests of this hypothesis are known to be biased, permutation tests are a reasonable alternative. We compare the type I error rates of the chi-square test and of three permutation test methods using synthetic data generated under the null hypothesis. In each permutation method a distribution of differences in deviances is obtained from 999 permuted datasets and the null hypothesis is rejected if the observed statistic falls in the upper 5% of the distribution. One test is a conditional permutation test using the optimal span size for the observed data; this span size is held constant for all permutations. This test is shown to have an inflated type I error rate. Alternatively, the span size can be fixed a priori such that the span selection technique is not reliant on the observed data. This test is shown to be unbiased; however, the choice of span size is not clear. A third method is an unconditional permutation test where the optimal span size is selected for observed and permuted datasets. This test is unbiased though computationally intensive.","inCitations":["407e6e8889dcaacc1bc34ab68c2130f28b7e8f73","0482853900183dd886639841ad0adab7a18d2ab7","aea390310ec9f4d642b9e36dc94432dc6d5e239a","5fe64e78b6b9c51de47b924dbcb065b4c7299328","b1db3b4ec88b6dba84bfbd58529dda41a91b0136","850e3ac2c6f13765ab845d6f196739de2d576bb4","c206738bbec533560fb7bd5cc58e3f6482962638","239e74da6ef64020238e793f5e525eecefebf921","fa4ad1e080096effb89bb95e4e8b9d51fbdd884a","4e5069342335b6b1f7be4cadc091fae950938e37","d3f2dd3f2a25394bcdef50346e2aba1a2d4a4fd2","12f1f00daf58031abcd3c7ababf46d555c938017","ed48103543ffc5dacf246b9e7c42d17ed687fbdb","af34da6a91f943fcbed674018d02b48654d9781a","ae350e86a99a97becad2e5f16d8c6317700997fc","5da7fc449145fb6150a32dc0b9526bf34b897154"],"title":"Generalized additive models and inflated type I error rates of smoother significance tests","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2010.05.004"}

With this approach, information on the effect of the active comparator from other sources including observational studies and early phase trials is usually ignored because of the need to maintain active comparator effect across trials. This may lead to conservative estimates of the margin that translate into larger sample-size requirements for the design and subsequent frequentist analysis, longer trial durations, and higher drug development costs. In this article, we provide methodological approaches to determine NI margins that can utilize all relevant historical data through a novel power adjusted Bayesian meta-analysis, with Dirichlet process priors, that puts ordered weights on the amount of information a set of data contributes.

To better utilize tolerance intervals for quality assurance, we reviewed the computation method and studied their statistical properties in terms of batch acceptance probability in this article.

This is quite unlikely, and DEA and other efficiency analysis techniques may yield biased efficiency estimates if it is not realized (Gajewski, Lee, Bott, Piamjariyakul and Taunton, 2009; Ruggiero, 2004). We propose to address measurement error systematically using a Bayesian method (Bayesian DEA). We will apply Bayesian DEA to data from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators® (NDNQI®) to estimate nursing units' efficiency. Several external reliability studies inform the posterior distribution of the measurement error on the DEA variables. We will discuss the case of generalizing the approach to situations where an external reliability study is not feasible.","inCitations":["be89a53e85a4d85e58b9f3a0d25c0d0a88ea9618","cabd28592bfe21075170b41edd22a4eba0ff743e","cf63f32adfac8736ff58bfbb24df28f90429055f","67804971a56eb4c4b00c4639891c28467dc3df86"],"title":"Data Envelopment Analysis in the Presence of Measurement Error: Case Study from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators® (NDNQI®).","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2012.724664"}

The classical finite mixture regression model is extended to incorporate functional predictors by taking a wavelet-based approach in which both the functional predictors and the component-specific coefficient functions are represented in terms of an appropriate wavelet basis. By using the wavelet representation of the model, the coefficients corresponding to the functional covariates become the predictors. In this setting, there are typically many more predictors than observations. Hence a lasso-type penalization is employed to simultaneously perform feature selection and estimation. Specification of the model is discussed and a fitting algorithm is provided. The wavelet-based approach is evaluated on synthetic data as well as applied to a real data set from a study of the relationship between cognitive ability and di usion tensor imaging measures in subjects with multiple sclerosis.","inCitations":["657f408e7b87145ddff7d31f06fd7c8e628da818","31158da74f93ba8b9e3883e8d4173e2da02255cf","aedabc42f64667bebfc4c8b1c1a999a075768a0a","67476133106e809b05c5b4808a90a33ee9b5c7f7","f6d91a81f442057f3f18e8479b36a17785fe8f5e","4cf1d6b548a40c42789790cdecd7110c64f48c55"],"title":"Wavelet-based scalar-on-function finite mixture regression models","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2014.11.017"}

We use an inverse-probability weighted (IPW) estimator to derive a doubly robust augmented inverse-probability weighted (AIPW) estimator. IPW estimation involves weights for the exposure mechanism, dropout, and mortality; AIPW estimation additionally involves estimating data-generating models via regression. We demonstrate that the estimators identify a causal contrast that is a function of principal strata effects under a set of assumptions. Simulations show that AIPW estimation is unbiased when weights or outcome regressions are correct, and that AIPW estimation is more efficient than IPW estimation when all models are correct. We apply the method to a study of vitamin D and gait speed among older adults.","inCitations":["0dfe6be46347283175aa6f28a182956859fd65ac","c9407c07efcb0e6073cff47aa50945b1a197033a","a6a8cade1e1e8e740aad3f8f02f49ebc3eb9a063","ec3a004f567c2db13b4b6059738cd912d5b02bec","e9f2c17f1a32a031c7e8511c430be8a809d6af1f","1d0c7b44b252a332618a44298a50de0d9bf937c0","e570ddb3a13f109b7fd173a61f3150a61212cea5","568d83284c4797ce227241afc424fb2d2f8d7db3","1cf4d969d0e6d85f123da833757d640158e8fe93","e9572148cfdb0a93f5c01d1051ccdab4e97c83a4","5a9eeaacf0f0fd95ca5680b69c8f4ac882d0ea8e","21b9452daa3529d2a80c5c18b4f08827cf28ed9b","115223e551453eccd0e10075ccbe47c73a7bb07b"],"title":"Doubly robust estimation and causal inference in longitudinal studies with dropout and truncation by death.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu032"}

Handling incomplete data incorrectly can lead to bias, over-confident intervals, and inaccurate inferences. One principled method of handling incomplete data is multiple imputation. This article considers incomplete data in which values are missing for three or more qualitatively different reasons and applies a modified multiple imputation framework in the analysis of that data. Included are a proof of the methodology used for three-stage multiple imputation with its limiting distribution, an extension to more than three types of missing values, an extension to the ignorability assumption with proof, and simulations demonstrating that the estimator is unbiased and efficient under the ignorability assumption.","inCitations":["6dee1e40148a297981aabfe0c58aa89d926518f7","3fef617fbd6556357f14c2683e40bdca170221f2","db301eeaf14ffcfde0fb0cec02508168ac915a35","a5fbf3ecec8dc2b672ada1a9b9de22e660680b73","28a73d4b150b36f836ba25dcbd54be50cbce3cdc"],"title":"Multiple Imputation in Three or More Stages.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2016.04.001"}

However, those ERGMs modeling the more complex features have, to date, been limited to binary data: presence or absence of ties. Thus, analysis of valued networks, such as those where counts, measurements, or ranks are observed, has necessitated dichotomizing them, losing information and introducing biases. In this work, we generalize ERGMs to valued networks. Focusing on modeling counts, we formulate an ERGM for networks whose ties are counts and discuss issues that arise when moving beyond the binary case. We introduce model terms that generalize and model common social network features for such data and apply these methods to a network dataset whose values are counts of interactions.","inCitations":["7db95f5ad54bfce6bef8d48761139d106ffb381e","afc4df82c6f7ed8f8587da8605dc78a5776d838a","b7f9f6a6275c8de78be16250697b7bfef383ee54","517ff59294dba86e4d6264f659347355e3caa822","c4e883bd56ad63d22009f0171987daf255d69198","32185f053c7e66f1129c92a3c3059c98343cff9b","2abf4402fa26f65e45fb67d44840a41888897fd1","a22a1b6e8992dfb736e9881f47f11dc88325fbf6","650f8ec488980fef41c5d33283c28b1873318e84","40720b4a9c7cce73303f0ce8657abb2abe047a89","4d7ba2b2b63cc616db65bdcf1640bda4b3817d38","68c06daa44a1134afc803db3aafab044e2074252","19b2fc725445a7ab51faf20fdef3e5dd0f57858f","0a9eda0e77a70448653d4840dca106d7d304b65f","10e8da292cf7b4b3ba81ba00310b59e1b2331628","54001ff32b63072d4c1d8d3110675dce0a4d9c87","009ddbbbac368c3d3deb2ef78dfa6ad96030456c","46d8f084d7aabdd39f671772c87e80132befd36d","fb6fe3fbd85047b4df5ea7a9e00b29b20238e2d1","613735c75d6f2cb12e1a4a7739f17f3c88eff72b","d77399361d4964773787b4c0a910f780ae9b847d","a796c04f08700fc2156ab465aeee8e6a1391d682","1f85a1d665fb0d85263c2883eafdabe929e8f92a","23bd6d514d1884dccd9a59d939941edae4e781ac","c26365252f6f56dd126e5efab5b3d0a6257cfa82","895c0d74dd123060578948f595ceabca453d2280","dd2719bb1c457f26c5764152068c7eb585c7293d","9fbcf9c6e4ec8b11a43bdb15d77c4b7ef4dcfcb5","c03ec3701ff777121ba81381d96fc8e51bf1e1ed","07ccbc178e894fe800509c204c364d69fb83232e","76bcdc31ae835a61a1e2e5488d2fa016eba4794a","22948e402fc5a39d7d410f3dc1ff3d84c42a3a35","29050e2058ab487d97a1d1162641acd91951f64f","0e6d688a5145aac325a607b0ee5a2f481e7d58ca","c6f2b618d5bee940acff2f1d34ceab25ff14b999","bffdb76c49c7bccdb8d062308b2aa4ff98e170fe","4243c8ce7935bd3a63e745e280656f18ae88bd20","7a5c8314663e1d44f9080a315419b9ec2b4ad353","42d8dcff6cd5259ad7299f4776f2c028de092be8","a81b7fe8a9777f14693ca5dc30e56ed68b393775","2799ac1bbd44b972d1f053a664e5d8212dca5d00","13893ece19f1df85bd5909685d4ff8fca5dfce53","96493acb98cd67b72bc4817c14a1ebb84e097cbe","707d3fb6603255f00b94f4968159e90e638deb9e","0318584ef0310af9890726cfa0617c14ea50744b","064f6394a5100b8952b5ca9dabf0d0db7edc7840","bf4146dcd79527c22f943bc8a7bc95148ff6025a","1f3b4e47f27a0e79fa47a796dd67d192619eaea7","289af65c86061b844eb0094395d31850588d798a","66aeb7fe1516ec3d799cbc4399ba5217d25db9b7","126f4d2c84a664c7edf6f1fa4cb0493caa2d09f0","fe5d8f7a6560aa422f87d089159da4d50df203e2","f8aad77cb34ba5792c8df3456a8bbbb11dcf959d","e4ed8722091d6604e4a6b5a76dd81308ab08f64f","a4f3dfeb7e52ce88ebe33378eb7e9064510cdb94","cd79e7e2e0cd29e6a8917835e1adcfe5dcec4015","39f10235bee4c82f5e148ff5ab239d6af7c250e9","8a57b538c9eac67a57c38a91d6f8dd6d2d153a03","d68023595e28eb298ef1e0f1856da5d75769d8a5","a946c681b7d217f9682c216daad94357c553f457","9a2944bcce651d6b49c4a58167e71c15ca767b2c","042d3c8c62d1b80011bcf975d1298c8d90c58eff","01d60f2436938f36c3dcd97bc1e37382709cdf1a","50068fdeed50d731a876ef2b4f0949115339a94f","e45dc337bff6bba4baf844e9f35479be35945406","ea117600e93c1f38cb1358511e8a625476685997","d4798eff829e80d23c893f19bea73791b5b015c0","61ede53272f795e1115badd45f28164e34b98a37","9970a5c4c5ead2b9ac5dc5e0bb428e712e9ce95d","66b037b39f2ed80766f434d5b97bf976e01a3975","5f1fc094430876864987055d72f51ff27e517497","b5575caf8cde710af30bd0ca9d990fa53dbfab56","6ecafc8b92e22db1ca20fa71bd0a47d0cf0b5355","7765d999d732c52d3e79a8559fbb141aaae0a6cd","70e8e0276a6d8b3c575fd79c733368f7136faef0","cbe41c08e829bd27f9252404f651dfdd535adda1","8e1b842eda2b65e64b4ee71d61ff1b5be6daa967","bb11b71f6bcba2cada99ce6b8f8c2f7c6971e1d4","b7a1af55cec17abe7d9f4378dec23dd0f5c424df","ffcaa00a6276df97a6d4b7725c268a58e2026ea0","ab7e80629c33c6e0b214115eccc7a7a466eb3b9c","ea01d5d5a04b23ac13334d5504ceae9c84162261","7190867805eda743817fdb71bc44165cc5d72485","4df21553931d3037d9711f4eda3df27ce9706240","818de322dbde73bfc16faba983ebaf30b2595340","7f4c4932f649ba5bf9294cd43cc3c4085c22d5fc","31e3079b37ec6f17fa16955c5476f2ee77153885","fcf4d0681db4c3e81e32297af12d10a5c5799a08","ddae6a1c741e877774a619f98fc4d81d56e7cded","a40f6dde9cfb47d9a7b82745e06c379194e5a55a","e516cc51b20098e244dd2997eb3ccb1b57d408dd","19e8660f6642c3a7603e184088c9791f68633953","4e02d1acbe80a04a48f980187d14a3da987a7132","ddc96f1f7606b5c14a9d55df5bf885ae12e0f29c","f684ce446ba8a44b7df47f48b61b5e796ba9fad3"],"title":"Exponential-family random graph models for valued networks.","doi":"10.1214/12-EJS696"}

Moreover, when high specificity is a prerequisite, as in some medical diagnostics, pAUC is preferable. In this paper, we propose a wrapper-type algorithm to select the best linear combination of markers that has high sensitivity within a confined specificity range. The markers selected by the proposed algorithm are different from those selected by AUC-based algorithms and therefore provide different information for further studies. Most notably, for example, within the given range of specificity, the markers selected by the proposed algorithm always have higher individual sensitivities than those selected by other AUC-based methods. This characteristic makes the proposed method a good addition to existing methods. Without assuming the underlying distributions of markers, we prove that the pAUC obtained with the proposed algorithm is a strongly consistent estimate of the true pAUC and then illustrate its performance with numerical studies using synthesized data and 2 real examples. The results are compared with those obtained by its AUC-based counterpart. We found that the classification performance of the final classifier based on the selected markers is very competitive.","inCitations":["07f6203970e5b583ea5d7e0a2f95571247727d36","af0fdb1d5da8184d2dea28542d1b9ca858f6e532","04518eeadf474b106afa6936aa154bb64825d0fb","015baeddddcb9f79434559a5e730db1f36fb2acb","7a3f1902b5e71c4f974fbe800498f5a6b7f645e5","5e49856e1ff25e31eb29fd5958c999dcdaee24ed","70b5025172529b0ae6d1618809551f0c21055c4d","4993226e3835898d3665c906a4d221ee85d55a5e","d1cf341b488ee29abaced2fae8bbf854fe16c081","54f0b106d66d906f4e86f7fd35bf48b3db3846b6","da7735e2c91fed47881b305653f388c18aad0918","9652ed87d4a101103a9ed13de82aa121c10c646a","df000715b52c8c39c4212b9201b5bd4c38555d87","7abf0309f47780cd1f4aa7173ff2395d7cad4412","8c8a7ba3b89b028a88bf6b70e486fd1a09a165f8","124707270a5df40f53639cfb33604c9250c3fc82","51a7ba70af53bdc54146747b4ce3dc1c2f45191c","bf05fa7339bbf906e35fd530bd88919c5c27a005","0b666f0793ae8daf01c1bd02334d169f1682d876","0118d27c7c1fb210df931a99002036c829286024","303f08375a5c62d20c7eb536ada1037ac8899178","2ba802157b800280d724e4fdeb30c018ed4672c2","7c0633c19416bfeab395637b0553b2f68b9c605d","4aa1c4a04d2ee5b59de5cb27bd761957a3c83b8d","316890f319ad30afdee12de0b3ba07bf895e9b3f","3ae131fd01d006ff6dfc7e08eacd27b3abd5017a","d5ebd21dde61239e7894d0db8ddbd1304a1c68e7","5a4722972f1449a86ffe9fa4df345f0313236fd4","532a1a69b3af7e75b2b2396b021891b1e9a8ec2f","95bbbfdda45d6632601be3d1b3c80db22125d9a4"],"title":"Marker selection via maximizing the partial area under the ROC curve of linear risk scores.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq052"}
