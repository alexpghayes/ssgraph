A simple approximation is given to the sample size required for testing hypotheses about the ratio of the means.

We present a more general formula that also covers hypotheses formulated in terms of the difference of means. We show that over a wide range of parameter values the approximation provides reliable sample sizes.","inCitations":["0e8925a3bc8ffe1a977c32e75c638bb245d55f32","a811b351ecc233bb51389db64a00c1f99fde685f","81898a6d58d12ab5ba45491f7a4ea4a75dccdcc1","65e89a9454b820a55d883f12be2867df96fa858c","7cf5b8939c5aca059d6377783e9ca89fa7564963","e555d1b579ef2e8c8c9eb51086f307f8264d3e5f","a22e06b23ed8e529da3fbf3b88d3796f67b38a5f","460e60c69d28bf02d3699c37cfbab603c33cbcdb","b61591170fd922540a33789b77d9df3b2599de26","8950d5236050649e85e1f3abc99b74b1ecf22b15","04f4c5224db0372f33967000f5ed80824673892f"],"title":"Approximate sample sizes for testing hypotheses about the ratio and difference of two means.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101200"}

If a true threshold for a continuous variable exists, the challenge is identifying it. This paper examines common methods for dichotomization to identify which ones recover a true threshold. We provide mathematical and numeric proofs demonstrating that maximizing the odds ratio, Youden's statistic, Gini Index, chi-square statistic, relative risk and kappa statistic all theoretically recover a true threshold. A simulation study evaluating the ability of these statistics to recover a threshold when sampling from a population indicates that maximizing the chi-square statistic and Gini Index have the smallest bias and variability when the probability of being larger than the threshold is small while maximizing Kappa or Youden's statistics is best when this probability is larger. Maximizing odds ratio is the most variable and biased of the methods.","inCitations":["6cf5abd094058031399db07c59b1d5a535601822","d92b5b23e6a1f1aaa21345b31a891b52cc5c994a","6367e0535a3897df4e86f3e30f636271ab06d1eb"],"title":"An evaluation of common methods for dichotomization of continuous variables to discriminate disease status.","doi":"10.1080/03610926.2016.1248783"}

The strategies were evaluated in simulations for different log-linear models of univariate and bivariate test-score distributions and two sample sizes. Results showed that all eight selection strategies were most accurate for the largest sample size considered. For univariate distributions, the AIC selection strategy was especially accurate for selecting the correct parameterization of a complex log-linear model and the likelihood ratio chi-squared selection strategy was the most accurate strategy for selecting the correct parameterization of a relatively simple log-linear model. For bivariate distributions, the likelihood ratio chi-squared, Freeman-Tukey chi-squared, BIC, and CAIC selection strategies had similarly high selection accuracies.","inCitations":["a8a8f0badba0ae9efd118fa8d708cc7b86f88ea9","2b5ff696c5d16142e21e5276d81d3959d95a9e15","e179e5f83cf9b1cd918df3be26ad39016faea4f8","e5bfb0201fcf9dfa3460f824606ce8c27cab25d3","4e88cb9165d5bfbaecd26bad84e428d6e10a0094","e1410568f29ad6c6864a6cec22fa8ba69232096a"],"title":"A comparison of statistical selection strategies for univariate and bivariate log-linear models.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X478580"}

A key feature of these data is the presence of “structural zeros” which are microbes missing from an observation vector due to an underlying biological process and not due to error in measurement. Typical notions of missingness are unable to model these structural zeros. We define a general framework which allows for structural zeros in the model and propose methods of estimating sparse high‐dimensional covariance and precision matrices under this setup. We establish error bounds in the spectral and Frobenius norms for the proposed estimators and empirically verify them with a simulation study. The proposed methodology is illustrated by applying it to the global gut microbiome data of Yatsunenko and others (2012. Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography. Nature 486, 222–227). Using our methodology we classify subjects according to the geographical location on the basis of their gut microbiome.","inCitations":["6a6eee1843d0d1d61f4c750cd42c235d5c0d60fa","bb65f8c8e49ece6ade038a8264e5e306817ad25a","f5bd2f3cd05dc0669fe06c2ad392dcc7018372f6","e16cbf9b07c832f116326397ed734fa35fb93672","744be7ab87b83985846f91f5a6e225434481ff0c","82705219176e7e8b559fbe2a87f126b83a564af8"],"title":"Structural zeros in high‐dimensional data with applications to microbiome studies","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw053"}

A key example is a sequential trial with a stopping rule, where stopping is based on what has been observed at an interim look. While such designs are used for time and cost efficiency, and hypothesis testing theory has been well developed, estimation following a sequential trial is a challenging, still controversial problem. Progress has been made in the literature, predominantly for normal outcomes and/or for a deterministic stopping rule. Here, we place these settings in a broader context of outcomes following an exponential family distribution and, with a stochastic stopping rule that includes a deterministic rule and completely random sample size as special cases. It is shown that the estimation problem is usually simpler than often thought. In particular, it is established that the ordinary sample average is a very sensible choice, contrary to commonly encountered statements. We study (1) The so-called incompleteness property of the sufficient statistics, (2) A general class of linear estimators, and (3) Joint and conditional likelihood estimation. Apart from the general exponential family setting, normal and binary outcomes are considered as key examples. While our results hold for a general number of looks, for ease of exposition, we focus on the simple yet generic setting of two possible sample sizes, N=n or N=2n.","inCitations":["d89533574f6461b7dfdcb536f195765b6009d656","ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb","946f537410ff47a7a1f9b70b6a2bdd6157ef8cea","f0e81d9c6641627e72d5953870ce129fafc05f98"],"title":"Properties of Estimators in Exponential Family Settings with Observation-based Stopping Rules.","doi":"10.4172/2155-6180.1000272"}

Yet there are inherent complexities in cost estimation and CEA from statistical perspectives (e.g., skewness, bidimensionality, and censoring). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that represents the additional cost per unit of outcome gained by a new strategy has served as the most widely accepted methodology in the CEA. In this article, we call for expanded perspectives and reporting standards reflecting a more comprehensive analysis that can elucidate different aspects of available data. Specifically, we propose that mean- and median-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and average cost-effectiveness ratios be reported together, along with relevant summary and inferential statistics, as complementary measures for informed decision making.","inCitations":["8ef695b20d53931649d52a129214967b5a863af6","8ffc294e4d65581301a56254a22e885c1c5eda54","62eab26112e48edb0dd5316cf80de7c3b67ab0ac","42754f97dcae96db76c9fca16fa89ab49887379f","b596167970a6274d621952b4f044af876abdf3bc","74403d9516f61e8027192c9fd844e282aa3d1e3c"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness analysis: a proposal of new reporting standards in statistical analysis.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.860157"}

Attributing this performance largely to the direct z-to-r transformation (DZRT) of Fisher z results (e.g. point estimate of mean correlation), in a previous paper Hafdahl (2009) proposed point and interval estimators of the mean Pearson r correlation that instead use an integral z-to-r transformation (IZRT). The present Monte Carlo study of these IZRT Fisher z estimators includes comparisons with their DZRT counterparts and with estimators based on Pearson r correlations. The IZRT point estimator was usually more accurate and efficient than its DZRT counterpart and comparable to the two Pearson r point estimators - better in some conditions but worse in others. Coverage probability for the IZRT confidence intervals (CIs) was often near nominal, much better than for the DZRT CIs, and comparable to coverage for the Pearson r CIs; every approach's CI fell markedly below nominal in some conditions. The IZRT estimators contradict warnings about Fisher z estimators' poor performance. Recommendations for practising research synthesists are offered, and an Appendix provides computing code to implement the IZRT as in the real-data example.","inCitations":["840a59fcc1744022f8465a93cdc1c538748f0215","8e788f016b4414025cc378f2ca3489d6da0913f4","16d105450bafbe4a6104a16f4fd4bf962a7a183a","06653591bc5292e3d693e27efcd8a0a37f732422","303225e30dd3ecc3a0fe93807d193ab9e6b1313d","d87176f2a64b88620a20506d614e4323a7ab6d1b","2a74f33e076e82b1cffa56abfb41817b0582c29a","536627142104e866b5752a7a6a93486d810d6745","0a5fe5435e7996d32fae4b977c6047e7ee33b118","cff13157754af76a95005fceb5daea0a71f3c16f","4f695ce8c83427d08c9f22463e3a382467ee9860","047f3850804ae1c5517d30657ceb35610797fc57"],"title":"Random-effects meta-analysis of correlations: Monte Carlo evaluation of mean estimators.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X431914"}

In addition to summary counts and percentages, statistical tests or summary measures are often desired. If the data can be viewed as two categorical measurements on the same experimental unit (matched pair data) then a test of marginal homogeneity may be appropriate. The most common clinical example is the so called 'shift table' whereby a quantity is tested for change between two time points. The two principal marginal homogeneity tests are the Stuart Maxwell and Bhapkar tests. At present, SAS software does not compute either test directly (for tables with more than two categories) and a programmatic solution is required. Two examples of programmatic SAS code are found in the current literature. Although accurate in most instances, they fail to produce output for certain tables ('special cases'). After summarizing the mathematics behind the two tests, a SAS macro is presented, which produces correct output for all tables. Finally, several examples are coded and presented with resultant output.","inCitations":["28410af240ba2712b20be061069cdd82104050df","da425bb68746f2b3f9407442f9142eb19b2988c3"],"title":"Tests of marginal homogeneity and special cases.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1573"}

The distribution is derived for the chi-squared test. Then this distribution is used to estimate the proportion of p-values sampled from the null hypothesis in a parametric framework.

In recent years, researchers have turned to the list experiment (also known as the item count technique) to overcome this difficulty. While list experiments are arguably less prone to bias than direct questioning, list experiments are also more susceptible to sampling variability. We show that researchers need not abandon direct questioning altogether in order to gain the advantages of list experimentation. We develop a nonparametric estimator of the prevalence of sensitive behaviors that combines list experimentation and direct questioning. We prove that this estimator is asymptotically more efficient than the standard difference-in-means estimator, and we provide a basis for inference using Wald-type confidence intervals. Additionally, leveraging information from the direct questioning, we derive two nonparametric placebo tests for assessing identifying assumptions underlying list experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our combined estimator and placebo tests with an original survey experiment.","inCitations":["73e66f542bee3f7366ebcb85339fa5f1bb5e4fa8","1f4dcf05a045bc087dece60e2afdec92e4156d70","3950d171e3baccfb169b2c3832af154e7b1459c9","4dc207206fb1b9e7698277163a542ab707c9ad5d","17af0734e2b0b028cf1e7ae60b69bd9d1f4ec8b6","4501e285d31a0c45f0107e71e348813e88b4096f","bfaead62168e26fdcf0704cdf57c220c27e52228","be99e61f7ee834fe9b148b996db47178a817e2b6","cc0a2c329a3a0ce11735a24b0465177c2a92a32a","eaa6b2979e9d44880f567a656504e312d928d44c","6aaa2fe93239b5bd63add60ce40a63a237d287f7","f443854e9b643e47a35108b18d9235183129d552","4d75ae6f917ad3f70c9fea07217e33a96b220bfa","526098d01a1e51724f426ed24d5edcb085e594cc","9c723fefb6f2ec81cfb6cfadb47a5c07b14ab759","80e57ecbb11672d8466e5a1135efacc1f612e91d"],"title":"Combining List Experiment and Direct Question Estimates of Sensitive Behavior Prevalence.","doi":"10.1093/jssam/smu023"}

In medical studies, this setting arises whenever a set of subjects, which may be heterogeneous due to differing disease stage or subtype, is profiled across multiple platforms, such as metabolomics, proteomics, or transcriptomics data. Our proposed Bayesian hierarchical model first links the network structures within each platform using a Markov random field prior to relate edge selection across sample groups, and then links the network similarity parameters across platforms. This enables joint estimation in a flexible manner, as we make no assumptions on the directionality of influence across the data types or the extent of network similarity across the sample groups and platforms. In addition, our model formulation allows the number of variables and number of subjects to differ across the data types, and only requires that we have data for the same set of groups. We illustrate the proposed approach through both simulation studies and an application to gene expression levels and metabolite abundances on subjects with varying severity levels of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Nevertheless, these data might provide a rich source of information on the disease transmission rate. This paper presents a novel methodology for combining CTD with rate-based contact network data to improve posterior precision, and therefore predictive accuracy. We present an advancement in Bayesian inference for epidemics that assimilates these data and is robust to partial contact tracing. Using a simulation study based on the British poultry industry, we show how the presence of CTD improves posterior predictive accuracy and can directly inform a more effective control strategy.","inCitations":["6eb74b6a741ef6f967113e6e07ad7a7e3693a465","d4d11610965d821fad99899fdf39fe21b9ecc722","d44a4feeea420d871222cb7a50b670be63fae1ae","a5ffed314801424daa203a12ddd54395a697308e","7e764ba469d467eab4181eda2619188206a95872","d486d51868e8d420880e5f21ae906a5150642763","133425481903bdb3edc62ac4330778679afa6532","56dfac7415589cd541b85d02b8551284b9a10d71","cffe1fd135d0f16d62feb058fe3bc5c1dd90ce0b","16750509ce7d14e7e68b0065b3f8581aa808a22c","a89e78241a7fc01d0f17b32c6a96fce5ba747d77"],"title":"Enhancing Bayesian risk prediction for epidemics using contact tracing.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs012"}

These three new test statistics have natural interpretations in terms of certain (weighted) L_2 distances, and are also connected to natural ``one-sided\" scores. We compare these new test statistics with the analogue of the classical Wald statistic and the likelihood ratio statistic introduced in Banerjee and Wellner (2001) for the same testing problem. Under classical ``regular\" statistical problems the likelihood ratio, score, and Wald statistics all have the same chi-squared limiting distribution under the null hypothesis. In sharp contrast, in this non-regular problem all three statistics have different limiting distributions under the null hypothesis. Thus we begin by establishing the limit distribution theory of the statistics under the null hypothesis, and discuss calculation of the relevant critical points for the test statistics. Once the null distribution theory is known, the immediate question becomes that of power. We establish the limiting behavior of the three types of statistics under local alternatives. We have also compared the power of these five different statistics via a limited Monte-Carlo study. Our conclusions are: (a) the Wald statistic is less powerful than the likelihood ratio and score statistics; and (b) one of the score statistics may have more power than the likelihood ratio statistic for some alternatives.","inCitations":["d7d5acd58b1e4a895056ecea65865c95f7c15fc7","3da4dd6fdd594029d8a29b5eb2707963dff05f5f","33ff0df2eccb68d68a3f61074c4f0da0f73472a0","15f0afb5fe528ea3df5cdf6c5613be1fcc79b986","3b898cbc126d6b4fac260916266ea8f4a98208b9","7aed6d4725d49147a15acadef3d8a93300180999","12db111d6d2d3d5576cbb1db9668ff184c121797"],"title":"Score Statistics for Current Status Data: Comparisons with Likelihood Ratio and Wald Statistics","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1001"}

For example, a test may have better sensitivity than another test yet worse specificity. Comparing tests on benefit risk may be more conclusive because clinical consequences of diagnostic error are considered. For benefit-risk evaluation, we propose diagnostic yield, the expected distribution of subjects with true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative test results in a hypothetical population. We construct a table of diagnostic yield that includes the number of false positive subjects experiencing adverse consequences from unnecessary work-up. We then develop a decision theory for evaluating tests. The theory provides additional interpretation to quantities in the diagnostic yield table. It also indicates that the expected utility of a test relative to a perfect test is a weighted accuracy measure, the average of sensitivity and specificity weighted for prevalence and relative importance of false positive and false negative testing errors, also interpretable as the cost-benefit ratio of treating non-diseased and diseased subjects. We propose plots of diagnostic yield, weighted accuracy, and relative net benefit of tests as functions of prevalence or cost-benefit ratio. Concepts are illustrated with hypothetical screening tests for colorectal cancer with test positive subjects being referred to colonoscopy.","inCitations":["5603b82db47bb3ec2d4028438541494c553383c6"],"title":"Comparing diagnostic tests on benefit-risk.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1226335"}

These types of assays are often characterized by small sample sizes, high measurement error and high dimensionality, as multiple cytotoxicity outcomes are measured across an array of doses and durations of exposure. In this paper we propose a probability model for the toxicity profiling of engineered nanomaterials. A hierarchical structure is used to account for the multivariate nature of the data by modeling dependence between outcomes and thereby combining information across cytotoxicity pathways. In this framework we are able to provide a flexible surface-response model that provides inference and generalizations of various classical risk assessment parameters. We discuss applications of this model to data on eight nanoparticles evaluated in relation to four cytotoxicity parameters.","inCitations":["9d9636df46d82397cf4881fc48615fd7cd2ecc6a","874ccdafd74a9b88e860825817d67b3f4329123a","26e89b5aae197d3de000471ee0bbc4475726014f","a0e6e7753768d671cdb15628f23630ed6f110183","56ece4ea7086c88c2173ee5cd8b1276c1f626fc8","0c5e05a814929fd7de7e7364f37d7d1157b2ddeb","15db01c53e794dfb6d9a9ba393658025a6232100","ce5a2de880d1fe72671590a2b23a48f4b6dda2f3","f33dcf2d33532f76ea61d93330bce4e98c4e97cc","fe40c2e1582048d2abc5da185fea94758ea7e5a1"],"title":"Toxicity Profiling of Engineered Nanomaterials via Multivariate Dose-response Surface Modeling.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS563"}

With a properly reduced model, a general method, which allows repeated observations with missing in non-monotone pattern, is proposed to construct exact test statistics and simultaneous confidence intervals for linear contrasts in the means. Simulation results are given to compare exact and asymptotic simultaneous confidence intervals. A real example is provided for illustration of the proposed method.","inCitations":["225ebe368e4819480f03281ba0588c702f5f7661"],"title":"Exact inference on contrasts in means of intraclass correlation models with missing responses","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2008.05.002"}

This indirect data structure occurs in receptor autoradiography, where the tissue distribution of receptors is visualized in the form of ligand bindings. This visualization is indirect because we can only observe and measure nonspecific bindings in one autoradiograph and total bindings in another autoradiograph. The distribution of receptors is obtained by subtracting the nonspecific bindings from the total bindings. Besides the reasoning of our method, an example is given using our experimental data.","inCitations":["c5cb2fd9f512485aef436997027d59baf7c53f72"],"title":"The difference of means of two indirect unpaired groups in receptor autoradiography.","doi":"10.1080/10543409708835199"}

When the subjects can be grouped into strata (e.g., study sites, gender, race, etc.), there may be a desire to determine whether the experimental treatment is noninferior to the standard in each of the strata. We present five possible analysis strategies to test for heterogeneity of relative treatment effects among strata. These strategies are either identical to or straightforward modifications of strategies that can be used to test for interaction when the objective of the study is to show differences rather than noninferiority. The various analysis strategies implicitly depend on different definitions of interaction. Power of the various tests will be low, a phenomenon that often occurs when testing for interaction. We present simulation results to quantify the power and type I error rates under different scenarios and an example to demonstrate the proposed tests. None of the analysis strategies is best under every parameter configuration. The tests may be best used in a descriptive or exploratory manner. Extensions to two-sided equivalence testing are also discussed.","inCitations":["bf687116e6252b8ecb062372857b3348d81c48ad","7c9f926bf746b668b833a9ab14e07175a8e06a05","62717aeb9d3556c3bd6e9285eb78154c10dfcd7c","2623679131bc70e5fd672b09c70f2230136b6147","7611f01f016452989896bf63bec9400e4d66dbc4","48974ca900360335d316c629505804fb691e9b23"],"title":"Testing for interaction in studies of noninferiority.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120017729"}

Fitting the factor analysis model to the sample correlation matrix is a complex matrix optimization problem which requires the structure preservation of the unknown parameters (e.g. positive definiteness). The projected gradient approach is a natural way of solving such data matching problems as especially designed to follow the geometry of the model parameters. Two reparameterizations of the factor analysis model are considered. The approach leads to globally convergent procedures for simultaneous estimation of the factor analysis matrix parameters. Numerical examples illustrate the algorithms and factor analysis solutions.","inCitations":["104f6ed1f8332cc90efaad67bd9d393b58c75333","04c08caf50bcec38a96969d19b4386ac233f10b8"],"title":"Fitting the factor analysis model in lI norm.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2005.tb00313.x"}
