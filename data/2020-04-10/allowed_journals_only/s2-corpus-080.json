Beyond the critical value the pigeons do not maintain the constant rate; and thus the control system is no longer linear.

As genetic data becomes increasingly available, investigators face a dilemma: when should data from other studies and population subgroups be pooled with the primary data? Pooling additional samples will generally reduce the variance of the frequency estimates; however, used inappropriately, pooled estimates can be severely biased due to population stratification. Because of this potential bias, most investigators avoid pooling, even for samples with the same ethnic background and residing on the same continent. Here, we propose an empirical Bayes approach for estimating allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms. This procedure adaptively incorporates genotypes from related samples, so that more similar samples have a greater influence on the estimates. In every example we have considered, our estimator achieves a mean squared error (MSE) that is smaller than either pooling or not, and sometimes substantially improves over both extremes. The bias introduced is small, as is shown by a simulation study that is carefully matched to a real data example. Our method is particularly useful when small groups of individuals are genotyped at a large number of markers, a situation we are likely to encounter in a genome-wide association study.","inCitations":["5fb408cec84a0348de9e76ea3a306a92cb218e0d","893596a9a91ecaaf04d6635c576e3150947356b2","d35eee80ebab04966b62a3281c8c25edeb7750f8","8d96d7e689eec648c0e5d879820a8a68f9c18cfe"],"title":"Improving Population-specific Allele Frequency Estimates by Adapting Supplemental Data: an Empirical Bayes Approach.","doi":"10.1214/07-AOAS121"}

Methods of estimating high-dimensional covariation based on â„“ 1-regularization are most appropriate when there are a small number of relatively large partial correlations, but in neural data there are often large numbers of relatively small partial correlations. Furthermore, the variation across trials is often confounded by Poisson-like variation within trials. To overcome these problems we introduce a comprehensive methodology that imbeds a Gaussian graphical model into a hierarchical structure: the counts are assumed Poisson, conditionally on latent variables that follow a Gaussian graphical model, and the graphical model parameters, in turn, are assumed to depend on physiologically-motivated covariates, which can greatly improve correct detection of interactions (non-zero partial correlations). We develop a Bayesian approach to fitting this covariate-adjusted generalized graphical model and we demonstrate its success in simulation studies. We then apply it to data from an experiment on visual attention, where we assess functional interactions between neurons recorded from two brain areas.","inCitations":["6de01b08542fc7bd15407bb64053e9d5aeb1dcb1","0bb344329f7a89a9cba84603abab1589957c9343","b3c01b37387e96aac0cf7a253d1b48b8a3e11c23"],"title":"Adjusted Regularization in Latent Graphical Models: Application to Multiple-neuron Spike Count Data.","doi":"10.1214/18-AOAS1190"}

Unlike a confirmatory registration trial, a PoC trial is exploratory in nature, and sponsors of such trials have the liberty to choose the type I error rate and the power. The decision is largely driven by the perceived probability of having a truly active treatment per patient exposure (a surrogate measure to development cost), which is naturally captured in an efficiency score to be defined in this manuscript. Optimization of the score function leads to type I error rate and power (and therefore sample size) for the trial that is most cost-effective. This in turn leads to cost-effective go-no go criteria for development decisions. The idea is applied to derive optimal trial-level, program-level, and franchise-level design strategies. The study is not meant to provide any general conclusion because the settings used are largely simplified for illustrative purposes. However, through the examples provided herein, a reader should be able to gain useful insight into these design problems and apply them to the design of their own PoC trials.","inCitations":["f4ad72b5ee226ce97c5a72a60527f78600561e7d","b88e06c700338d7b87011665d2df1383cc5c9355","ce00af86de86cceddaf263fa344903521453004c","dd1aeacbed8da7c8fea2166db67dbed46741b56d","542cdba0c3ff4a1e91feb5a456bfaff77540ddec","88f400582c68c48d0edf93d799b86044253fef70","25b741da8bbe14ebf6126e4feb872e78f94ea976","1d938fbf7ed59ba63717f85b3a1036a77037fea0","19ba82f3f673bca772c55a13048e2d5f73da6718","3fe5758cc635b73bc5b0a90d9ba496285b741bbe","c354fb668139dcb6731618d01ceb2128d3edfd3e","365568e35524d0d6efae25b00b88c9cad447e9a2","6d94eac3f5bcbfe7a2d58fd4186ef99bd9db910b","d524d9141301c99ca4a9e803cd2f34bc2b7a3b8b","c7912d650b6fe98787ca6c52edc24d008f5b355a","b2d398cf788dbd32b8af47c74e9478d4c53c5830"],"title":"Optimal cost-effective designs of Phase II proof of concept trials and associated go-no go decisions.","doi":"10.1080/10543400902800478"}

Many biological processes, when observed across the time among different individuals, fit into this concept. The observed curves are modeled as the composition of an \"amplitude process,\" which governs the common behavior, and a \"warping process\" that induces time distortion among the individuals. We aim at characterizing the first one. Because of the phase variation present among the curves, classical sample statistics computed on the observed sample provide poor representations of the amplitude process. Existing methods to estimate the mean behavior of the amplitude process consist on aligning the curves, that is, eliminating time variation, before estimation. However, since they rely on the use of sample means, they are very sensitive to the presence of outliers. In this article, we propose the use of a functional depth-based median as a robust estimator of the central behavior of the amplitude process. We investigate its properties in the time warping model, and we evaluate its performance in different simulation studies where we compare it to existing estimators, and we show its robustness against atypical observations. Finally, we illustrate its use with real data on a yeast time course microarray data set.","inCitations":["d5fae24d0932dedd45970c20b2cab9cd83fa240c","7cc65c7f2f1702691a545390e01f5ca3c89287a4","41e466840e062c1b3de8a807bc456a2d6a02cb32","249c550418c32c45a784b4ffba057223609e7d01","b90e69564f1d741b1501360e7b1665a99e1982bf","32588661890106564827a71221392ea6c40e7898"],"title":"Robust depth-based estimation in the time warping model.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr037"}

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in both adults and children, affecting 8% of the US population and costing $37-63 billion/year in the United States of America. Asthma is a complex disease, whose symptoms may wax and wane, making it difficult for clinicians to predict outcomes and prognosis. Improved ability to predict prognosis can inform decision making and may promote conversations between clinician and provider around optimizing medication therapy. Data from the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) years 2000-2010 were used to fit a longitudinal model for a multivariate response of adverse events (Emergency Department or in-patient visits, excessive rescue inhaler use, and oral steroid use). To reduce bias in the estimation of medication effects, medication level was treated as a latent process which was restricted to be consistent with prescription refill data. This approach is demonstrated to be effective in the MEPS cohort via predictions on a validation hold out set and a synthetic data simulation study. This framework can be easily generalized to medication decisions for other conditions as well.","inCitations":["c829982a70e2244ca5fbbcbfc883506239cf22e3"],"title":"Prediction of individual outcomes for asthma sufferers.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx055"}

Identifying a change-point value in prostate cancer survival and cure could have important policy and health care management implications. Statistical analysis of this data has to address two complicating features: (1) change-point models are not smooth functions and so present computational and theoretical difficulties; and (2) models for prostate cancer survival need to account for the fact that many men diagnosed with prostate cancer can be effectively cured of their disease with early treatment. We develop a cure survival model that allows for change-point effects in covariates to investigate a potential change-point in the age of diagnosis of prostate cancer. Our results do not indicate that age under 50 is associated with increased hazard of death from prostate cancer.","inCitations":["8d623d6fc25faf8b1eec390b5b8409fdd3864747","825b0cb7e9c0cf2d7d454ca278f62096900040be","4f05ccaa917de0d68feb200dcfce0cf8cd2c5f01","ab4a6c3882e38bf134175f2e4b736e056abad65a","5a88301f3a31650f0f343ee368c1e04a38d5aac0","b56eedcb578f2a19e8507edbf428e8c5f3c8128d"],"title":"Change point-cure models with application to estimating the change-point effect of age of diagnosis among prostate cancer patients.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2011.626849"}

This method, which we call multivariate regression with covariance estimation (MRCE), involves penalized likelihood with simultaneous estimation of the regression coefficients and the covariance structure. An efficient optimization algorithm and a fast approximation are developed for computing MRCE. Using simulation studies, we show that the proposed method outperforms relevant competitors when the responses are highly correlated. We also apply the new method to a finance example on predicting asset returns.

Although there have been some proposals for including sample survey weights into Bayesian analyses, existing methods require complex models or ignore the stratified design underlying the survey weights. We propose a simple approach based on modeling the distribution of the selected sample as a mixture, with the mixture weights appropriately adjusted, while accounting for uncertainty in the adjustment. We focus for simplicity on Dirichlet process mixtures but the proposed approach can be applied more broadly. We sketch a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for computation, and assess the approach via simulations and an application.","inCitations":["5d79d91229ec8a5f3db711fc2998bf97283e0add","cd0a75fe5068ba2324838f55554cb4453c82a3a7","28589dae0151d8783e2f9c4b08797b60f2b435c4","c3cdf4423d2dab58583e6dd3ce4261f5a791bf87","41b0a53b8d573a6e13d837999e847445c735d415","4a938a739a9cfd87bc85600191fc1bfd92e04429","6b02436e61a8d7f77e0efb9c838215d6147b75de","096d3c1ef7ec711da19cad43f409626d3e16b89f","f9b3f96df7fae7c4b76965d28546c4da5fd8b759","d325f3fad342bddb6536cb5e4d1da3babc648a3b","dda72dc5614eb576a87f81a335a6d425acda7a81","c7065d79a41b2b47f3275e3231d1804d75bcd7c1","4a554546c96ad9dc7fe3e2df79f6ea9681556c11","5cbdb45e78792fd50dec05f22f2f3b454e9e9c6b"],"title":"Nonparametric Bayes modeling with sample survey weights.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2016.02.009"}

An alternative approach to evaluation of scale reliability following deletion of each component in a given composite is outlined that can be recommended in general for scale development purposes. The method provides ranges of plausible values for instrument reliability when dispensing with single components in a tentative composite, and permits testing hypotheses about reliability of resulting scale versions. The proposed procedure is illustrated with an example.","inCitations":["2e04dd24fcf91549601c737e1da307a44f69cd68","2cbb26be38c489febad629dc9d1d07e2473ceba6","efdd8c8babf3f7cabed22f4d4477b569a90e6bef","31575b775f415cf1f7ce2592a093fe7e87364d4e","5b8dd90b06fb4146654bc84ba6d5a93550421f3e","f32330d76c61315615327d4d4f4a2daae7b7c485","f22a120c5d612e66aba2be3160cccadd1475040e","89cb7c667b67e24edeba68788aa577fefe48a08b","67bde63b6efa714c6b1e91e19af223139cad0b3b","8edd61ac83a643e2a5017415a382c7b35236f969","9483a12b397d0bf00f3d076959ee679aacbeafbe","2852a2d98117c546bc70129e99f8d719d2ba38cd","9b355f8d593da573eafd16a896d93bea5119ae74","5f87861a7f1992009fdf0aa943bd9df914b2f1bf","7c564f007c41c42fdcc3f6932a7e2b21454c1017","a007acb3227bd661ec238145a3819956b6bae8f8","b16d0566217cdcc2881cf34015441925d777c52f","c9c0c13b7668a8deba86384a76c93fd15183bab5","52d77e8e6a0181f9d309a62f26160745a1459c08","5dccd03aad56160ad36d72d92d818d150fd0a383","cd31fb454324307fa2c9a2e1ad1342ed3f21288d","afd3a3bd57cb0c074045f2893f0ea6d01f3590fd","0dc0bc5a6e12b263a501fd64138aca5ae347cfaa","3fbd09544a9622c9b81d3216559e1350786d7e29","732ddf3b7022b4f52951e26a5b8526c8c0140e40"],"title":"Reliability if deleted, not 'alpha if deleted': evaluation of scale reliability following component deletion.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X115954"}

It further describes the use of bridging studies, when necessary, to allow extrapolation of foreign clinical data to a new region. Bridging studies are performed in a new region for medicines already approved in the original region. The conventional noninferiority criterion requires the treatment effect (adjusted for placebo) attained in the new region preserves a prespecified proportion of the treatment effect attained in the original region. Such a bridging criterion, however, is often impractical. Hsiao et al. (2007) proposed a Bayesian approach that borrows the strength of the original trial to establish the treatment effect in the bridging region through using a weighted prior distribution. The weight, however, is often difficult to prespecify. In this presentation, we consider the overall treatment effect by combining the weighted effects attained in the original and bridging regions. The maximum weight allowed to be placed on the estimate of bridging region in order to show a significant overall treatment effect represents the strength of the treatment effect in the bridging region. Regional approval will be evaluated either by comparing the weight estimate with the prespecified limit or by benefit-risk evaluation of the medicine. Sample size requirements for the approaches are derived. The simulation results of type I error rate and power for the proposed methods are given. An example illustrates the application of the proposed procedures.","inCitations":["9218e973d895f887e3369afe28c482841b9e57e2","f2d50a09e063f9de6ca2b1e1c45fb17e5ce3d8a4","a146dad1cf294f3445f4f400bd251e22512a42e5","8484be05b4d17eb466f6b1098e559f82127daabf","e7089a226f31fcecae8edc7193bd9cf2341bbf19"],"title":"Weighted evidence approach of bridging study.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.701580"}

This method fits first-stage model(s) using the technique of iteratively weighted filtered least squares (IWFLS) to obtain location-specific intercepts and slopes, with possible lagged effects via polynomial distributed lag modeling. These slopes and/or intercepts are then taken to a second-stage mixed-effects meta-regression model in order to stabilize results from various locations. The representation of the models from the stages into a combined mixed-effects model, issues of inference and choices of the parameters in modeling the lag structure are discussed.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2016,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"For the analysis of longitudinal or repeated measures data, generalized linear mixed-effects models provide a flexible and powerful tool to deal with heterogeneity among subject response profiles. However, the typical statistical design adopted in usual randomized controlled trials is an analysis of covariance type analysis using a pre-defined pair of \"pre-post\" data, in which pre-(baseline) data are used as a covariate for adjustment together with other covariates. Then, the major design issue is to calculate the sample size or the number of subjects allocated to each treatment group. In this paper, we propose a new repeated measures design and sample size calculations combined with generalized linear mixed-effects models that depend not only on the number of subjects but on the number of repeated measures before and after randomization per subject used for the analysis. The main advantages of the proposed design combined with the generalized linear mixed-effects models are (1) it can easily handle missing data by applying the likelihood-based ignorable analyses under the missing at random assumption and (2) it may lead to a reduction in sample size, compared with the simple pre-post design. The proposed designs and the sample size calculations are illustrated with real data arising from randomized controlled trials.","inCitations":["3d9b41ef59e61e35ebb31b72813064d641918466","79f3ec790af749fbff804adf2918e3d7728605b9","90ea0a3a656c3f23b0502c81831fb4ee04345fa4","779afc277b6a4e2100affd53fea65dc590bf6aed","d5aeec46ec7832029e594f9f53dbc28ffded2d36","1d71f67475ecb642c4e184fb928cdce629cf460d","e5f794a62d3d91b9a3b64b40a4fddb0118d64069","bef1ec8c8143243727067376a8afb2cb3ffb20d9"],"title":"On the repeated measures designs and sample sizes for randomized controlled trials.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv047"}

If dropouts are not completely at random, covariate control over informative individual differences on which dropout data patterns depend is widely recognized to be important. However, the inclusion of baseline scores and time-in-study as between-subject covariates in an otherwise well formulated SAS PROC.MIXED model resulted in inadequate control over type I error in simulated data with or without drop-outs present. The inadequate model formulations and resulting deviant test sizes are presented here as a warning for others who might be guided by the same information sources to employ similar model specifications when analyzing data from actual clinical trials. It is important that the complete model specification be provided in detail when reporting applications of the general linear mixed-model procedure. A single random-coefficients model produced appropriate test sizes, but it provided inferior power when informative covariates were added in the attempt to adjust for dropouts. As an alternative, the incorporation of covariate controls in simpler two-stage endpoint or random regression analyses is documented to be effective in dealing with dropouts under specifiable conditions.","inCitations":["117f36d7a3e3fc7fbfae27ae1215815ac7bd0e80","3d469abd7925ca0c7d823a639d34f93bcca24ed6","b9437dd4caa353cb796804a24d78feb3f45ee85a","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","49569a2eaa4e62d0cde6ce4e460558205376ce0b","410433b22af855f7a8fe8397f79167168079b5d7","10dd968b79d3a3966730f226f73acd1de01f038f","67a272b28de64ebf305ca5df68afb1ba076501ee","96e772a9bb5b0197a94a10efedfc52e6df311cd0","d6765efb77defb9c63eb56fd2ae811eeb086ad30","409ed85c070ebc99f954dbae7fe61da61e9db96e","7de65df192a65210c73d6e72426b6ea4c6241fb4","092536f8361d071656f1be8dc7d0c05c02176a58","91a44c4ebcff032e552ddd87bbdc03f21f37071d"],"title":"Problematic formulations of SAS PROC.MIXED models for repeated measurements.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101008"}

In many practical situations the covariate can not be measured precisely and a natural alternative model is the errors-in-variables regression models. In this paper we study a null intercept errors-in-variables regression model with a structure of dependency between the response variables within the same group. We apply the model to real data presented in Hadgu and Koch (Hadgu, A., Koch, G. (1999). Application of generalized estimating equations to a dental randomized clinical trial. J. Biopharmaceutical Statistics 9(1):161-178). In that study volunteers with preexisting dental plaque were randomized to two experimental mouth rinses (A and B) or a control mouth rinse with double blinding. The dental plaque index was measured for each subject in the beginning of the study and at two follow-up times, which leads to the presence of an interclass correlation. We propose the use of a Bayesian approach to model a multivariate null intercept errors-in-variables regression model to the longitudinal data. The proposed Bayesian approach accommodates the correlated measurements and incorporates the restriction that the slopes must lie in the (0, 1) interval. A Gibbs sampler is used to perform the computations.","inCitations":["a8d6a9379b1e4f223c53ebc66b1e16c9a9574a16"],"title":"Bayesian analysis of a multivariate null intercept errors-in-variables regression model.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120024208"}
