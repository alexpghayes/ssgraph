Among other approaches to investigate this puzzle, recent research has started to elicit private households' expectations of stock market returns. This paper reports findings from a study that collected data over a two-year period both on households' stock market expectations (subjective probabilities of gains or losses) and on whether they own stocks. We document substantial heterogeneity in financial market expectations. Expectations are correlated with stock ownership. Over the two years of our data, stock market prices increased, and expectations of future stock market price changes also increased, lending support to the view that expectations are influenced by recent stock gains or losses.","inCitations":["912bd12a3fbdbf7cf8f838aa2c674dabfbe0fea8","37d62de76d2313e2a7d47905b410570309dc9f5a","1997a4540e6b2640fef019a98c14341c59cc5215","e6399d55d0700a72cabb4898a9515d5f179a729c","07816f1aef71b0c0405c8f114f9eb9913261f38f","50f54b09796732f55b67aa388e03dbdf3403a867","24c2b1f1f87874956c685a0f04e2e25306283265","b4bee5d87b109379f6b4bb68358cb97dc8b5afdf","ff833987b58f3aa737cebbcf4aae819fa256d4f6","3eb0feff015d533a71470daacc4d4acd88fde94b","25c2a83012620d9d30f7f0e489dbdd0a1b0ac7e4","418d2f8f2badbb77bd6e4105fc54846cc212fd9e","af89088a071dab34c6590a0befe721331910982e","cdb733b54eed728c9130b3d6e67442f77a843110","87954dfc05356a950afd4855970316b952604fd0","82336846bbb4126d2f12a08342648520c2515fd9","e9dad8e11ea9202c346faedde031b94bf8708ffa","98dc616af60218d19ac4bf6bcc3746ec3bfc6634","7e7137816c394b3fb8c3a18dc0820c2a66777e53","97aa4a1e22ed1ff02abbd0596c4279e2ef626f31","27badf88487992ff6bac2de2f86c7e915c99410e","322a5a4a8a4f01d6d73ccec0f0a22d701b7794a1","fbe3bafc519b09e45728392e18d49fc536ade2e3","bb11a551d33d44ed328c517cc1bc10c33bd91747","8812029b7406b5edf28137d3f184958ff3423b2d","5ac271787b240fe0fd2b5f571c9793c9812e4d08","1331752f6e7425d10ac71bbd52873b0193552418","0309ab84e6a5ac84ca967626213cb692264b704c","dd17df202a7761375f1d9dddf1ffc5f8a787afde","9c40be0af2370c598787cd269f8933b456cc3c5d","4fd9f8562572bf8dd1ce76fd1348a5441db4961d","2161452747c4a248d2553499287074b579952753","dd32dc219bdab52cb0689052db1a3643ea06ecb6","f969373156437e64467b33c44250f8b32e6a2142","ddf324b591bfe2d7db5d61f252c25113928333f0","5c359bdcbd3fc94db2c8cba55b72371bdecd7867","2ae3b219f4b266dc6c6a602964272dc6c5f67172","58ccfa4e33e628eda529f98da9c430d9f5ace744","e53e75fc1cb9cb65979f9c0dcd0fabe788a82efa","932fd163c848902f3a0702652cec0a870a2569f0"],"title":"Stock Market Expectations of Dutch Households.","doi":"10.1002/jae.1242"}

Recent technical advances permit genome‐wide gene expression measurement at the single‐cell level. Single‐cell RNA‐Seq (scRNA‐seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA‐seq and scRNA‐seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA‐seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA‐seq are zeros, which could be either biologically‐driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically‐driven, genes expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA‐seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell‐to‐cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high‐throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA‐seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell‐to‐cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA‐seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell‐to‐cell. Then, we show how this technical cell‐to‐cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch‐effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.","inCitations":["1be5ce25332b194ab94e5a84b8101e8abae0a9c7","c1f05d2e6d5216181f730833c63afb19f658e1c5","0a40b005e23cbe50e36b8db78148923cc8935cf8","fe6d461e8a137135e62b623cfe7a84dffd847708","f18a8580b688dbe7f99a7bc9e048771c2949e0e8","7d28b98e3b18ba803cbe3e36e99d5c61b832608b","3149e8512d19a0a72d5e3a122d72bb1c3a00ef84","ece458be5928c6ab16dceaf0e0f8c4054e3236f7","9c368930c06a597064dd018464f28450cc326c64","b04fc928358e2982d54261216717b2e900ed8e3f","79b5992b424abfaef73e6be3e561389e31f864f0","33e9dcee6f0ddc17492329c353170783bc8fb3ef","216ed800c65da64f19b4901b093083d42a96c7d1","54d19eb98e74003b8c806427dfc7e3370c717b72","465bae97dc44cf1c5e5e9cc2c551b1dc77984a0d","07401d2af35acd9206638204df9fe95bc0fb39e5","4b2c214a660dfe9e4b7df65670a981f9da650e1b","bae80ac3f4dd4709c639fde8e549d03b02abaa38","7636a022ac942952b9da5c185ec905a9b57760e3","62e9dd46204d37cee070a65c48b6eeeaecfca730","5bd75ff773adef2867eff0c066e2a5160e22173a","bf3447b4c5fd98b236f408ff86d1f8acfd467676","e5f823a527cf21125be327ccfddc5a68eb61facc","dcffa7cc4a1bdf7076a47b5f219e65e6a03acb98","75b3520ff79d60e71d2a5b693fa7283fd176f5af","a757de35a2592c42094e50ec2a162f50d056e01d","2f3c9911e5c2054333b6cd5f52892db234689c7d","55a74a2a52039e4b387fa54edfcd5249878550a7","0cc5bfe8bb02e3ac4b00e3744a733163320de16d","96bfdc546a07f11c34786ebbc3b8cb0986e71f94","f76a37c32a76238960691353b1305cbfb36742a1","fccbcbe07de338889b71f9e59c99960a53d86ccb","0d7e58fc24bd5790bfd536506e0879cb0a9565c4","c4109da5c502b4b4d21d748de7d023947d5f467a","97bc1f7808ba732210d996fa392c5650e7efd0c1","eda6a2534446c6612d035ae1a6f1a29c28a605ca","fae873d77ec51fb332958a3e5ff6911185e217b2","7728012ad6d9c7e2c923e9c847ab2174da97f6f1","74d70d1ed4b9ce7de913f9224a5a6eb040dbbc99","56bf103a956b4a2ad11868c05db189d1e3f64ac1","86279d37a85da67a75a7eaffb3e5d844a5d0e7fe","1d43e492763f22313dd26a89bc4aac8ac9d85001","3a60f63aa0c1dc509fce32e258a0d94a6b24e277","957e75143b0032872aeb1d70305c4f75cd3bc476","36d0c1ddf3d9390dff307373a6c9b9d25ef6f5e8","732134a7ee8b6203d8ccab3e50f69d1c9e843d85","89260e820c44076712a38d81edafbf2cc97955db","8d8bc3450fd467602036bd9566c37fb2f4e8a331","2aba23446cc8c1b3b844c0cdd6c4171214ee3d90","5159d51a4e27a85dd311029d082c27e16435fe3b","1334b18d8462035ff5a4ea50b8e78b571f545032","af63c4cf90a5cc6cfa80f56d17805e985fa985c9","d9c208af563534ed6add7b8e1e9372909e850f83","3ad3171936124f3f7a6a1ddba59da6f8d55bec68","8182962a6ffe3506c35d5e69829fb22abd892102","13005147965349cd6de72fe5b3d78013d1bd8427","71a4dbdbf75a738dcf5d82a651f72b7e9c92ad34","f9e6f9b3b30107a0f45de90a6c53f42205226dc8","4de16d27aa0ea16e785ca60702237a96272bb812","0568ea41af60f6455f987883ab83bad1f46fbc31","d2cad2a090177151f10a5e04d069dcfe776da732","e66e82b4a52f5f8c536e52460744aa6dc173e3b9","f14cdb93a96a1a4b509552bed50b81c7c38a3623","3d3ac772084a79c79848940969fd6642ab2c2998","b8ce412d8818a1eae73933fc5f6daf4925d4ac72","e3c8e3cca4cd210e0dffd3e2f70da601c7e6e8f1","b7e5cddf0912667f4ea87f2b146962661370932e","86977d37097db206523c72e4a71ff959507e12a8","15af5beb3aa3cc26b804e9797653f3c46b7fd0d4","f2d061264f20c6cc17ef19ead155772b0d7bd063","29ea12f3a48060f10affbd3ad30da6223c377cf6","727bef807477c2e7fc2333328a19422fdebbe525","1f1cb2c76ec7f1b5668534d9c8de57ea5b2bfac1","c38cb21744f3878e41688de928c6ceacb7e15269","d5c9240f72b6dd8965e282aee16af26ef29294b4","b59d3ccb3e2d61afebebcf76ba2935e857c7d3d2","99d71994dfa8e31b9708f4b168eaa128cdc610aa","bef3050818e6336b24d657f7be8603492efc64f3","4b4a4146834393c5c9acd63c7a4f1bb34e705983","ab60863b724690086b1e776db9d375bc93fad71a","180e06002d1b6d4336cd36bfb6bbeabf8ca7a559","646191f8052b5c1417fde3a4eeeb61b659d12dc8","0057deed2c13afc288a6936f1c6aaeb4fea55dd4","dce1a18cd43a007ef6549750908fc6cf3f53acf1","ff570a093892706db8685429f98730332d6001b6","5bb038bcf1655c343ed9bf2db9050d32ce226d0e","58e4a3ade9e4b5f99f00fff57a5e1e93ad28d91f","403a6a98cac7c9fe05b5f7ad2adcc3158149a82b","6ecf1dfa2688d949a309e2cc336ddd929a69b12b","1390a4a8fbb640f598cc042005e9c114cbe1c24e"],"title":"Missing data and technical variability in single‐cell RNA‐sequencing experiments","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx053"}

These consistently estimate the parameter of interest under a semiparametric model when one of two nuisance working models is correctly specified, regardless of which. The recently proposed bias-reduced doubly robust estimation procedure aims to partially retain this robustness in more realistic settings where both working models are misspecified. These so-called bias-reduced doubly robust estimators make use of special (finite-dimensional) nuisance parameter estimators that are designed to locally minimize the squared asymptotic bias of the doubly robust estimator in certain directions of these finite-dimensional nuisance parameters under misspecification of both parametric working models. In this article, we extend this idea to incorporate the use of data-adaptive estimators (infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters), by exploiting the bias reduction estimation principle in the direction of only one nuisance parameter. We additionally provide an asymptotic linearity theorem which gives the influence function of the proposed doubly robust estimator under correct specification of a parametric nuisance working model for the missingness mechanism/propensity score but a possibly misspecified (finite- or infinite-dimensional) outcome working model. Simulation studies confirm the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators relative to a variety of other doubly robust estimators.","inCitations":["8d7d26695485d9a39910e662ad820c6d83f3ead9","1acfe671c0c8676cb456000c987340b6e5a51fe3","1efc98b6a5f82d85b44392a0493649f1f5065666","e0cad0c76d169facddf1074f8182af3030952a57","48d4f716939215907dc51d5bbd6d45c7b05f0e29","80fceedc7ac73b870689291d6f509b3d65a3b47d","2f36009d7872d990af1cef333655bf028d0d9e77","e900c5ca416f9aa5b657e2bdd4b8b344289923ec"],"title":"Data-Adaptive Bias-Reduced Doubly Robust Estimation","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0029"}

A popular approach to characterize brain functional networks in fMRI studies is independent component analysis (ICA), which is a powerful method to reconstruct latent source signals from their linear mixtures. In many fMRI studies, an important goal is to investigate how brain functional networks change according to specific clinical and demographic variabilities. Existing ICA methods, however, cannot directly incorporate covariate effects in ICA decomposition. Heuristic post-ICA analysis to address this need can be inaccurate and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical covariate-adjusted ICA (hc-ICA) model that provides a formal statistical framework for estimating covariate effects and testing differences between brain functional networks. Our method provides a more reliable and powerful statistical tool for evaluating group differences in brain functional networks while appropriately controlling for potential confounding factors. We present an analytically tractable EM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of our model. We also develop a subspace-based approximate EM that runs significantly faster while retaining high accuracy. To test the differences in functional networks, we introduce a voxel-wise approximate inference procedure which eliminates the need of computationally expensive covariance matrix estimation and inversion. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods over the existing method via simulation studies. We apply our method to an fMRI study to investigate differences in brain functional networks associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).","inCitations":["0612d4ec9381cd842d440c796c1726a372d0038f","1e0880db0d1d3b50c93af3cab94ff11418c02ccd","973683b20fd9a3fe694673ddd48650facf23bfff","fa518b071ed089c8831e6a5c1cce1ae15bd526cb","50c3e7284279098aab3f3514f86cd785f6bc2c02"],"title":"Investigating Differences in Brain Functional Networks Using Hierarchical Covariate-adjusted Independent Component Analysis.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS946"}

For the analysis of such data, the Gamma-frailty proportional hazards (PH) model is a popular choice because the regression parameters have marginal interpretations and the statistical association between the failure times can be explicitly quantified via Kendall's tau. Despite their popularity, Gamma-frailty PH models for correlated interval-censored data have not received as much attention as analogous models for right-censored data. In this work, a Gamma-frailty PH model for bivariate interval-censored data is presented and an easy to implement expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for model fitting is developed. The proposed model adopts a monotone spline representation for the purposes of approximating the unknown conditional cumulative baseline hazard functions, significantly reducing the number of unknown parameters while retaining modeling flexibility. The EM algorithm was derived from a data augmentation procedure involving latent Poisson random variables. Extensive numerical studies illustrate that the proposed method can provide reliable estimation and valid inference, and is moreover robust to the misspecification of the frailty distribution. To further illustrate its use, the proposed method is used to analyze data from an epidemiological study of sexually transmitted infections.","inCitations":["27431f9632afb15145e3d2e8bdcc6f87e763e65b"],"title":"A Gamma-frailty proportional hazards model for bivariate interval-censored data","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2018.07.016"}

The sample ratio as a point estimate of the corresponding population ratio has been considered. It has been shown that the Fieller-Hinkley distribution of the ratio of two correlated normally distributed random variables readily provide a technique for constructing confidence intervals comparable to the bootstrap percentile and Fieller's confidence intervals. A finite parameter space based level alpha test of an inferiority hypothesis formulated in terms of a fixed margin has been derived.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2014,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with fixed raters or, equivalently, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for continuous outcomes is a widely accepted aggregate index of agreement in settings with small number of raters. Quantifying the precision of the CCC by constructing its confidence interval (CI) is important in early drug development applications, in particular in qualification of biomarker platforms. In recent years, there have been several new methods proposed for construction of CIs for the CCC, but their comprehensive comparison has not been attempted. The methods consisted of the delta method and jackknifing with and without Fisher's Z-transformation, respectively, and Bayesian methods with vague priors. In this study, we carried out a simulation study, with data simulated from multivariate normal as well as heavier tailed distribution (t-distribution with 5 degrees of freedom), to compare the state-of-the-art methods for assigning CI to the CCC. When the data are normally distributed, the jackknifing with Fisher's Z-transformation (JZ) tended to provide superior coverage and the difference between it and the closest competitor, the Bayesian method with the Jeffreys prior was in general minimal. For the nonnormal data, the jackknife methods, especially the JZ method, provided the coverage probabilities closest to the nominal in contrast to the others which yielded overly liberal coverage. Approaches based upon the delta method and Bayesian method with conjugate prior generally provided slightly narrower intervals and larger lower bounds than others, though this was offset by their poor coverage. Finally, we illustrated the utility of the CIs for the CCC in an example of a wake after sleep onset (WASO) biomarker, which is frequently used in clinical sleep studies of drugs for treatment of insomnia.","inCitations":["ddfc9e436a219112a832f7ed9183ce4cf72dfc9c","38f48180e8dcff7f4362be0334b14d3d2e27ebf1"],"title":"A comparison of confidence interval methods for the concordance correlation coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient with small number of raters.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.863780"}

Both samples consist of a dependent variable, some error-free covariates, and an error-prone covariate, for which the measurement error has unknown distribution and could be arbitrarily correlated with the latent true values; and neither sample contains an accurate measurement of the corresponding true variable. We assume that the regression model of interest - the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the latent true covariate and the error-free covariates - is the same in both samples, but the distributions of the latent true covariates vary with observed error-free discrete covariates. We first show that the general latent nonlinear model is nonparametrically identified using the two samples when both could have nonclassical errors, without either instrumental variables or independence between the two samples. When the two samples are independent and the nonlinear regression model is parameterized, we propose sieve Quasi Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Q-MLE) for the parameter of interest, and establish its root-n consistency and asymptotic normality under possible misspecification, and its semiparametric efficiency under correct specification, with easily estimated standard errors. A Monte Carlo simulation and a data application are presented to show the power of the approach.","inCitations":["01081a8416c83a3285eec0a4d43639ec0d7c7335","41a5df0616858fc4b06353af345cf410f44895cc","1c70ee8c948c1c866697524bbf4a6c57eaa9c51c","7fd3b0f34bb34c157d892311d187d80224f785f2","5089c2fa087a27f29bd507cb67d09e17bde33ffd","8be468a96a12a3644066047d71f141b9709fe038","cfefc43f5edc8ebefeaf632d3ea53f6489d4fa95","ee149265d519b89e2d086fa2378b9b80b089ca31","44ce64a231fc91b084fe86f057d73bc18ca9cf0c","c79e2c4f16634b085d03fd45ed78c75e4a649c9c","8c066bf6724717d88dcb6f0913799da54a26695f","9950698d5fb0dcd8fe986afe6f88a69762c7d5ea","9df0cbc363e0697e0547b717dc45d452a65b8145","517ebffe8032d8102c5064e7c4afd3c3b4fbb731","e926886749bcee2c8f7f0e23742c351d1091253b","69ec2ecfc37335a68729cda08e578889d87ce371","abd643fe8d9b3b6ffdec72b62ca22c1757d7df4e","549c7802a76586aab3be403310fbe445fa514138","7115ebd91d3d3e9f88fbe3dabf2d253014be6f46","dc17ea8d71b8cf7b1c382147e991d1c84af63cc7","f12122ff49d9388a37cb71dd2ecd9495a06d1ae4"],"title":"Identification and Estimation of Nonlinear Models Using Two Samples with Nonclassical Measurement Errors.","doi":"10.1080/10485250902874688"}

A common criticism of these methods is the inability to characterize relationships among variables from a fitted model. Although several techniques have been proposed to \"illuminate the black box\", they have not been made available in an open-source programming environment. This article describes the NeuralNetTools package that can be used for the interpretation of supervised neural network models created in R. Functions in the package can be used to visualize a model using a neural network interpretation diagram, evaluate variable importance by disaggregating the model weights, and perform a sensitivity analysis of the response variables to changes in the input variables. Methods are provided for objects from many of the common neural network packages in R, including caret, neuralnet, nnet, and RSNNS. The article provides a brief overview of the theoretical foundation of neural networks, a description of the package structure and functions, and an applied example to provide a context for model development with NeuralNetTools. Overall, the package provides a toolset for neural networks that complements existing quantitative techniques for data-intensive exploration.","inCitations":["44a240b393bcf5a4eef6833abffacef835e39755","56123310f7ab4c1331f8bcd37097c4404b3c36db","cbd141a819af7750e126fd58ae2aad45a3fe309d","97e499f4eb152b9df5fd3b24c284ea889003c788","d03152279e713e572f7e3320b71a25653566728d","abb9562f5f3101b3cdaa44950d04d14f68cc06b3","c24c75fbf01bac77ade277ff3698d8680f004ed1","3ec0fee6436bc9bfb483eadf6cf54ce95a35d6a5","21256f18c213a4a2c8d2927d51a7484a25de9dd3","09b0d4d7ed15737948bfe4f9d62fb094962f3876","edc5713a2f01b1c6abb950106848c3046657c7ef","b10b4b91eed5922f10a44f377335dc0dad03905b","a4552ac3d7a4510227203b8388c899ff9428a969","247755e0272355f4233539faa9daa33589dd09a0","03874e05c356223ba0362bc5483e2dbaba8f3202","a0afc6f73d380acb04bb05243f37728cd6546318","1394446c6ccf1a167184dbe3228a1526e30b132b","7f3e80bc3e56e833d8a17800074b4722c1d4ceec","7c35ff2a6fa3e47033e973fcf0996d1698567f4b","c424906f50570eaeff28aeb0de76997885d09d32"],"title":"NeuralNetTools: Visualization and Analysis Tools for Neural Networks.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v085.i11"}

Methods based on fully parametric mixture models are available, but lack of fit in some examples indicates that more flexible models may be beneficial. Existing, more flexible, mixture models work at the level of one-dimensional gene-specific summary statistics, and so when there are relatively few measurements per gene these methods may not provide sensitive detectors of differential expression. We propose a hierarchical mixture model to provide methodology that is both sensitive in detecting differential expression and sufficiently flexible to account for the complex variability of normalized microarray data. EM-based algorithms are used to fit both parametric and semiparametric versions of the model. We restrict attention to the two-sample comparison problem; an experiment involving Affymetrix microarrays and yeast translation provides the motivating case study. Gene-specific posterior probabilities of differential expression form the basis of statistical inference; they define short gene lists and false discovery rates.

The proposed method is shown to work for a broad class of hypotheses by accommodating a variety of dissimilarity measures between two binomial parameters. Two of the unique features of the proposed testing procedure include: (i) construction of a flexible class of conjugate priors using a mixture of beta densities to maintain approximate equality of prior probabilities of the competing hypotheses; and (ii) automatic determination of the cutoff value of the Bayes factor to facilitate the decision making process. In contrast to the use of Jeffreys's rule of thumb, two forms of total weighted average error criteria are used to determine the cutoff value. Through several simulation studies it is demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian procedure has competitive frequentist properties of controlling type I error as compared to the default frequentist test and meanwhile the proposed criterion improves the statistical power, especially in small samples. The method is further illustrated using the data from a streptococcal pharyngitis clinical trial.","inCitations":["e922374ddccfa455e491147654c8378ef0c994f9","c089f34a0c1ae1858e3bcb3b450ef79391ab5be8"],"title":"Semiparametric bayesian testing procedure for noninferiority trials with binary endpoints.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.544526"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":1993,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"The mental processes involved in performing some tasks can be represented as directed arcs in an acyclic network. A path directed from the head of one arc to the tail of another indicates that the process represented by the first arc must be executed prior to the process represented by the second arc. If there is no directed path from one arc to another, the corresponding processes can be executed concurrently. Information about the arrangement of processes in an acyclic network can be found from the effects on response times of factors selectively influencing the processes. The methodology was developed earlier for critical path networks, in which a process begins execution when all its immediate predecessors have finished. This paper considers shortest path networks, in which a process begins execution as soon as any immediate predecessor is finished. Results analogous to those for critical path networks are reported. New results are presented enabling investigators to distinguish sequential and concurrent processes in both critical path and shortest path networks. This information is sufficient to construct an acyclic network representing the processes. Further, by examining the effects of selectively influencing processes, one can determine whether a task network is a critical path network or a shortest path network.","inCitations":["b3354889997b2e4134914cf97b2f6491fadb4a5e","6c1d41a0336757579502162f78280290f6472d81","3863182b2917f26897d249ecf9b3004ca2857bcc","8be0f605aa8ef22e3648633f3d9d167f37039618","cc96645fa45640613bf7e22659ab57460bcc887e","34e2bb611e05adcf085123f3b172556f38c2b152","f15dc3de3cc2818df93818f9e71f7b6d989c183b","21ec82c0a34d5136eb39f525d5fa3f7bb4e8d7f4"],"title":"Effects on response time of factors selectively influencing processes in acyclic task networks with OR gates.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1993.tb00999.x"}

However, the frequency of blood samples drawn from patients is limited due to clinical or pharmacoeconomic reasons. We discuss some sampling schemes for an immunosuppressive drug in phase III studies. Selection criteria and statistical approaches are discussed to select blood-sampling time points in four scenarios from a single study and from combined multiple studies: (1) Area under the curve (AUC) only without constraint, (2) AUC and Cmax simultaneously without constraint, (3) AUC only with constraint(s), and (4) AUC and Cmax simultaneously with constraint(s).","inCitations":["58d5ee588bbcacf2c97dbda8e311c3907308f66a","c479a7f90311877bab8c0816ed1d0f049eddff89"],"title":"Optimal selection procedures for abbreviated area under the curve (AAUC) of blood concentration versus time for drug blood concentration levels.","doi":"10.1080/10543409808835249"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2008,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In clinical trials with interim analyses planned at pre-specified event counts, one may wish to predict the times of these landmark events as a tool for logistical planning. Currently available methods use either a parametric approach based on an exponential model for survival (Bagiella and Heitjan, Statistics in Medicine 2001; 20:2055) or a non-parametric approach based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate (Ying et al., Clinical Trials 2004; 1:352). Ying et al. (2004) demonstrated the trade-off between bias and variance in these models; the exponential method is highly efficient when its assumptions hold but potentially biased when they do not, whereas the non-parametric method has minimal bias and is well calibrated under a range of survival models but typically gives wider prediction intervals and may fail to produce useful predictions early in the trial. As a potential compromise, we propose here to make predictions under a Weibull survival model.

Estimation of the component of the causal effect of a treatment that is not mediated by an intermediate variable (the direct effect of the treatment) is often relevant to mechanistic understanding and to the design of clinical and public health interventions. Robins, Greenland and Pearl develop counterfactual definitions for two types of direct effects, natural and controlled, and discuss assumptions, beyond those of sequential randomization, required for the identifiability of natural direct effects. Building on their earlier work and that of others, this article provides an alternative counterfactual definition of a natural direct effect, the identifiability of which is based only on the assumption of sequential randomization. In addition, a novel approach to direct effect estimation is presented, based on assuming a model directly on the natural direct effect, possibly conditional on a subset of the baseline covariates. Inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators, double robust inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators, likelihood-based estimators, and targeted maximum likelihood-based estimators are proposed for the unknown parameters of this novel causal model.","inCitations":["7b94f9e838252477624aa1389e6a09d05eeca902","a97a6ad64e20f1fd0a636c1c2d3eeaff1013be57","2beef38f5a3b7a2fd52e64d2b5a7f7cebc5479b4","c4297edab3767f289e4d8b514527f793ed402be9","62a641908e65eb1c04b43403d95658dc02515734","89085a8552ded78a401fe383bd9dd62dd647fcea","e0f9ff0b9396f415363b426e5e1e22a2035d9417","f8e056bc125a8329a051fb079958489aeda7e96e","4fae4dc575c7ea9b4f71466580985636bdce6138","a55fd138c719fed5b9467fdecd0e57c66c31dede","61b8d2f37be0344bbbf6d30dbbd2e115a8555388","4189cce07f76554e79a6810ca3c794c20aa38ad5","c71223bd53f04cf89d0567524ba5bb789fd3c0bb","6721c7d4e265659a00b7da4fb7727b32dc19e9d9","0cda28571694ac39ab22fad256c732f94602b8c2","6541274b2776dbd0e928af3f59887f7436eb9a43","ab99b239bc2ee3161e6a0ff0b0e23909db6ea18a","3ac9fce7c97aedb30d7f7fde9914a78a5660ad3b","0b1ace7bea72b5701dc228813b1c5de04b98505a","cfcf3fd10e49cf28bf24bf95b8855730b90042ef","f04831c3732a41a3e284920c2f81fca294871d69","2086b68d8c450c15a0abb585b6c4fb23001dfb6a","93a18741ef40b98a4181a020a91e7f7db46006a4","0ac1ce02b6e96e5616bf32a4f839456d2c38c5d0","36f1340e100a2774ead78f9b2ddd189c8e560829","b58c9365c768d6b4504d6e38f03e2278c65d745f","40e00c944ca01028aee3d6741d06869fd5a17f09","b6285411e2fd8cd3b84a4918aa4dd645b399fe51","acc844e37c2553ed497a61e0c2fe55f70f6b3732","f09f6e4ff0b059ade8044ee3ff3c6917bebccf8d","0146f5eeb3d5900acfdf8aec42f409c62289b529","4acf563189315ab39cd0a10b9de7db0ad75c3169","c659558dff1fcc38713d553f54de17614212c626","41825192562676c9564e920b8d26bf24acc7e44c","77ee42946ad9721f450e7164388d28e0fdcf71c6","5dba30c906420351d57d80e18e625d4c18e951d6","f9a7543e55d0c0d6c1b29301deffbe9e4fc89051","1b2aa5577f66c1d7a79c6c3a03ed6d95ead3ec81","731c28d537ef07c0ee00fab492cd0518dd33701a","c14194bb9bc01767eb0f966cc8f8414e069d1c41","2caf81b3c200f3c5a4a42c57495f3a0c1265e3b2","5b8f1413fd941b19ed7b1bebbe9d167339f9eeb3","bfd9c3be86450212db5b949ff53ff3343cd4b1ef","c1fc97bb3a39031a946f3ccd907e1cf79d50b570","92cfd24f9f40ce0cea1c49cf1c36f57a8201cbae","fc30326c78dfdb2c716edb39585287dfc9a101e5","284a4329808e7af7ca34f828235e451703e4cbc0","d7446da402e7c6ce0c35b3c91ae778542e359b6f","65c3af674360aa718bf2135cc0560c380c3a42c2","2b370450d041c90bf643f21eba14fd44e908386c","0a968aa344eff2300d5d258ca4db2afa51bd83f9","7876ee362e62f8a8572b1cd23f877c7ff67407e8","1be25f3d238c171797ba058cb5411a6355a113d9","bf95a237a509b561ba940643e44bb8cac1c37f3b","99b732c8d1094dd5f8484e0ec8081169fa86be7c","65750aeb33ac580a5e3f106bf61561ae772cdebc","eb59cf7717b6db35f54ad5b06e909c7d15e88dc1","b0b2c40e5689c5e0f6cf234d2ad48c6151da2efc","013025b1eac9d91e0e8236048bbffecfdcbb0799","793d675269f5def7f3fec81f0c4f30228285405b","bd6f666234344b9fb16cf74428f032a820632cd5"],"title":"Direct Effect Models","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1064"}

He argues that it represents the violation by the plurality procedure of the weak dominance axiom. Weak dominance is a condition which some social choice theorists consider that a fair and reasonable collective choice procedure should satisfy. However, there are fundamental difficulties associated with this new position. The criterion defined by Colman as underlying the weak Borda effect differs considerably from the weak dominance axiom. It is also inconsistent with the definition of the weak Borda effect itself. Moreover, it can be argued that the criterion underlying the weak Borda effect is in fact an unreasonably severe standard. It confounds an undesirable requirement (that only tied winners should be permitted when there is a cyclical majority) with a desirable requirement (the Condorcet criterion). Thus, only social choice procedures with a tendency to produce indecisive outcomes can satisfy the criterion. Other problems with the approach are pointed out. It is concluded that the weak Borda effect is of little relevance to social choice theory.","inCitations":["0b32b24b2dc252f9c76834b4518e3cca69bf3649"],"title":"The weak Borda effect is of little relevance to social choice theory.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1986.tb00847.x"}

In this paper we extend this methodology to the case of continuous self-rating scales such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used in pain assessment, or the Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA) scales in quality of life studies. These scales measure subjects' perception of an intangible quantity, and cannot be handled as ratio variables because of their inherent nonlinearity. We express the likelihood in terms of a function connecting the scale with an underlying continuous latent variable and approximate this function either parametrically or non-parametrically. Then a general semi-parametric regression framework for continuous scales is developed. Two data sets have been analyzed to compare our method to the standard discrete ordinal regression model, and the parametric to the non-parametric versions of the model. The first data set uses VAS data from a study on the efficacy of low-level laser therapy in the treatment of chronic neck pain; the second comes from a study on chemotherapy treatments in advanced breast cancer and looks at the impact of different drugs on patients' quality of life. The continuous formulation of the ordinal regression model has the advantage of no loss of precision due to categorization of the scores and no arbitrary choice of the number and boundaries of categories. The semi-parametric form of the model makes it a flexible method for analysis of continuous ordinal scales.","inCitations":["d1ec054d0c4936056ab4961b6103a7e5497d1336","8dec9acfcc612367d87bd4370cbeef10ce9d7f6e","632f75baedda07454e2ec32f902ce01299f733d7","11f376e637e19edf5cbd3953578ca1de955a997e","23b580bb332498d5dc4334647faa3e32dea71288","048b52da14371b7e48bc6ff4a704f3b8774b8191","5c30c3f4e7f864132038e4d1f1201ac354fd5b53","6c8488078ba46d4a5ab584e0bfd929af02a6038a","f091cebf9e0a78768f357c831eaf7019c5dffd68","0f95422cf84a99079b2153a8379a10b9d15a3573","fd8dcfef2bf2d51c170459df3f5d6b0dda8f80b0","f2d98292fca9881cc0ee5f57c570d7ce4c8e958c","8cf2fd4e213fac8b00510ed8b7c1c75b5a0ebfe0"],"title":"Ordinal Regression Models for Continuous Scales","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1230"}

Results confirm that the analysis of covariance (ANOVA) can provide appropriate correction whether baseline means differ significantly by chance in the same or opposite direction from the inferred treatment effect. The results from analysis of simple pre-post difference scores are highly dependent on the direction of chance baseline deviations in relation to the directional treatment effect that would be inferred from rejection of the null hypothesis. The attempt to correct for baseline differences by expressing outcome as percentage of baseline entails directional bias that depends on the location of the zero point, the direction of change, and the level of correlation between baseline and follow-up measurements.","inCitations":["24fdd92ca136246129bd41b254bf6f0af375d916","729087146b5151d4f489549e26a4a12f48b6d865","e83497a00c43c5924617ceaccc73840761d4564d","1ed522996fb8cdf7a5889ae832542d3be856cbc9","633183af97fbe1be25208d2c06962473d2db44c8","43cbc9cf25aa3ecd0868f96ffaf12d411f3e04ee","461c46b3574091f983805da7aa850d96aea2ec6f"],"title":"Directional baseline differences and type I error probabilities in randomized clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543409208835039"}

Because incorporation of such constraints is challenging in semiparametric models that allow latent variable distributions to be unknown, previous methods either constrain the median or avoid constraints. In this article, we propose a centered stick-breaking process (CSBP), which induces mean and variance constraints on an unknown distribution in a hierarchical model. This is accomplished by viewing an unconstrained stick-breaking process as a parameter-expanded version of a CSBP. An efficient blocked Gibbs sampler is developed for approximate posterior computation. The methods are illustrated through a simulated example and an epidemiologic application.","inCitations":["d2d89b578f1b34a26fe5f56aa6f2e98ffb0de1ee","f8328e2a75b0f3cad1602b4fdfe0bfd9a7bfb4df","e91bcc630b81f159c3a1a546580c51e8e27f9d81","fc0072d44f801191875c7220c494b61f4f47ac12","5db77dba7edbba7f79a4f641de73efa43cc3f33f","ebbfc2eff9d158570310f49c7f1ccc997dcddc7f","a31882f6491d6426eaabc79f464ba5529da17f56","cfc1ae03a4eb87b54b1db8881a5827d8c6ee950b","fcd87562884a7b9406603463c77310cc6cec15d8","018f29b1fbb9bb171f06dd6e84898aea5111d550","583a5902aca67c7f76f4d7caacdf5cfcb125bc5d","4f11ccf999d06c57b64ab2b8a38072f7764189a9","cf0d39d5923af719d0d3685ce396fc32abbf79a4","01e1d4f9298554f9d0589a8020b4f7554db1fbfc","13f0450f32ca8d9aa53c9e19492b311f2cc7252b","30365a8364cb4c95d6d518883af16b27ac2c6fc2","e34bfc4630b9eae431493e6927ee1b20b76b87c3","48cd5456758c14a57f5aed9c2b6b537498f08393","7eaf60a47f1469cc72e66502746fa20a5f39ff91","ccde7ce469234f83eecb373d59b7f2d113bddbcd","6bc642bed947b644235e859d70ead5da689e4d1d","164ff73f4b483767021adc2fb9c1eb3938d1d84e","5b95ffdd45311c75d5d26b9bb5d5b02a9a276835","b460064c467cbab81ac984b8eac79e42be37e4ed","26f1e3e71ff4f4250f17a73f5b82445f81b681bb","0937134ff31b318d254bce3242dbe2031a6738d3","cb0ad1c382e43adfc4aa9060352168dd2fc5f581","41e2968cf6c71258388e904331fc329c3d4be338"],"title":"Semiparametric Bayes hierarchical models with mean and variance constraints","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2010.03.025"}

In genome wide association studies, researchers compare cases to controls with respect to thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms. It has been claimed that the Bonferroni adjustment is only slightly conservative if the comparisons are nearly independent. We show that the veracity of this claim depends on how one defines \"nearly.\" Specifically, if the test statistics' pairwise correlations converge to 0 as the number of tests tend to ∞, the conservatism of the Bonferroni procedure depends on their rate of convergence. The type I error rate of Bonferroni can tend to 0 or 1 - exp(-α) ≈ α, depending on that rate. We show using elementary probability theory what happens to the distribution of the number of errors when using Bonferroni, as the number of dependent normal test statistics gets large. We also use the limiting behavior of Bonferroni to shed light on properties of other commonly used test statistics.","inCitations":["78568a42a091b2a36340ec657091fd2b4cedf517","4ed2e6071affbea09687274e32358013fc8a2532"],"title":"Asymptotics of Bonferroni for Dependent Normal Test Statistics.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2010.11.013"}

It has been found difficult to achieve good simple structure when these higher-order factors are rotated by means of an analytic rotation procedure. Instead, it is proposed that the projections of the original variables on an orthogonal higher-order matrix should be computed and that this matrix should be rotated rather than the higher-order factor matrix. Comparisons have been made between the old method and this new method for the same sets of data. The new method was thought to be superior in several respects.","inCitations":["3d5e7735a2e2763492a3ca0787f3c0e0047b1be6","97e0a3d4b51ba6974d0b5d8ec9f103e2fb63e97c","1d74b22e7244b8d2bfc7d0b73ad1099b595749b0","7fe82edc58a5881cfa287f0c526b9aa732142af2","3e8700a13061968f9b4ea2b05375b7c3d259a6ba","1c0b95711df12e1fb6d69d9d03f9780230446093","d4083c336b73abe2b6dc7ea3435843b5b6082a23","76b986477bc9eccbc9b87f061b20f650e2ceb0d8","7cb186d8c8c8fdda8f698ab3cf1e5bb2486cc6b4","1cce9a37682261757e4ca4502bd1fc548b902656"],"title":"A method for the rotation of higher-order factors.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1966.tb00358.x"}
