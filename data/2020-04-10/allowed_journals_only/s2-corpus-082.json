On the other hand, we consider it important to emphasize that their perspectives are different and that one framework might better address certain types of research questions than the other. We show that, compared to a LMM, an OU process based approach can cope with modelling inter-individual differences in aspects that are more substantively interesting. However, the estimation of the LMM is faster and the model is more straightforward to implement. The models are illustrated through an experience sampling study.","inCitations":["bbf924bac2fc8157ab8f021de1592664a7d0eda3","7efb99bd3018ec9b9ac7ed3673f5962de893276f","abd1bfb2b95599c36913bc15cde42f607d3dd11f","b782e51ba0ce9de85f9f1707ddb297120565fdce","46488e675dc7d7632f3a2a1c76514f90dc9fe170"],"title":"The linear mixed model and the hierarchical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model: some equivalences and differences.","doi":"10.1348/000711010X498621"}

Other work in this area has concentrated on rigid body transformations, where scale information is preserved, motivated by problems involving molecular data; this is known as form analysis. We concentrate on a Bayesian formulation for statistical shape analysis. We generalize the model introduced by Green and Mardia for the pairwise alignment of two unlabeled configurations to full similarity transformations by introducing a scaling factor to the model. The generalization is not straight-forward, since the model needs to be reformulated to give good performance when scaling is included. We illustrate our method on the alignment of rat growth profiles and a novel application to the alignment of protein domains. Here, scaling is applied to secondary structure elements when comparing protein folds; additionally, we find that one global scaling factor is not in general sufficient to model these data and, hence, we develop a model in which multiple scale factors can be included to handle different scalings of shape components.","inCitations":["a2ead60ed472b6b7273a75b7ce359d5a6784f80f","69970183751405c591b1a5b8a1ac88f405693995","e0f11137a1fc7367d070ac80a5b6effba5eb0f5f","94ebb162afbcd6cadcecff8da720e663e7e0de19"],"title":"Bayesian Alignment of Similarity Shapes.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS615"}

This sparseness invalidates the usual approximation to the distribution of the chi-squared or log-likelihood tests of goodness of fit. We present a solution to this problem by proposing a test based on a comparison of the observed and expected frequencies of the second-order margins of the table. A chi2 approximation to the sampling distribution is provided using asymptotic moments. This can be straightforwardly calculated from the expected cell frequencies. The new test is applied to several previously published examples relating to the fitting of latent variable models, but its application is quite general.","inCitations":["b311f4cb029397064462a886e078781bd985cbd1","961d68c5451f0edb757bcbcfea868b772901ac14","13f93ce95f8e9705e1bb1dd03af3132f1558b32c","d7523c07e99daa42a06088413bcd86fdb02aa783","32bffdd0b9a9cbe9605df8935cd4a0bf128cd819","e0cded2039d208ed31338680a8fba48457692ac5","cc1100df18cfd1f809507a0d71440b9897519e90","cd9f50548596b43cc90c63a37dc7790bcc2be1f5","b680200330c089943b9cd8d59742dfd1c3e5552e","d11df0bf0ab9f63de0e5abf21fd5861eba0e1054","02cba3d93e5dd2330eba6cd7b566cad3ca3626d4","8359ea1ac24bbd3a68881b50b81ded4c99e8fb95","b020627f12b62ff3b6af67cd9a6b2f04e5372528","10b373160fb77015792e42c844cc1a550068ec6a","63723cf18696ff28c2216158f1c63ab723d0a1b3","37dffb8b4a1b67462c6114b123e475f978658e10","72df6c287bb3bffac554cf68f28f67eda65f5c4c","16c60282c2e060cc27660f8ff90f79b2b16f5928","7f3968c4b8d6c92e441abe24219562fb16829f3e","a35a1e4812f1436bf264484853a8d0c1a0244cee","80f7bddac733101ba7d62eda37b6eea3ac8994ea","2128f2a25222ece524b786e882c717dd24cfcc07","cee889318ec66b717e25f0628cfed888f805a6d2","efe10b430906e27f176cc05126f35d940ef15cbb","dd7bd10193ca2eb375d88c7a7acd07dc9f27a3eb","fe65b39253467f66a4d5bfe561b2a9225b0b1713","a5e0fd9592e7219424cd9ad3485d832589a2c04f","cfd14e99a9c1e91574d2ed99848e781dcccd58b5"],"title":"A goodness of fit test for sparse 2p contingency tables.","doi":"10.1348/000711002159617"}

We are interested in understanding the impact of medical breakthroughs, treatments, or interventions, on the survival experience for a population. For this purpose, estimating the underlying hazard function, with possible time change points, would be of substantial interest, as it will provide a general picture of the survival trend and when this trend is disrupted. Increasing attention has been given to testing the assumption of a constant failure rate against a failure rate that changes at a single point in time. We expand the set of alternatives to allow for the consideration of multiple change-points, and propose a model selection algorithm using sequential testing for the piecewise constant hazard model. These methods are data driven and allow us to estimate not only the number of change points in the hazard function but where those changes occur. Such an analysis allows for better understanding of how changing medical practice affects the survival experience for a patient population. We test for change points in prostate cancer mortality rates using the NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset.","inCitations":["60c7eb1564f07a3e235fc00bce4fa7344458bfd2","032c89ecea88e184c563128e76a4e63d6297c4b7","e784c390c71de748a4c983c8bf86a87892c8057e","ff92cb040e15d1d21ceb56fe7301483eba612079","92ca7ba42cebaa75242afbc525665f4dfb8924a5","599d9a7be33d282115c8530b27f46c4311a98e05","15d0d7ee4835676bf75e40ac1ef7b89de3eaa9f9","407a03e5696356a5847fbd0a59abd6cfbb56b91b","c4208a7158a773e763b42cf750c24015ad80d941","c13e074a45a6fbc653a5fdfdbe0ab03a8220e94c","9d1631660268d894951396012b7c8a8b2d2a347a","40adb556c53a94d63a7d7cddccba3f9f04a1220c","724e28f7639e6c4c4030da116bb6c6966cdd6af2","4b23228baab617afeba02697ebfbedd3d487d7c2","c4c973c6d7f37c29a17497fd52ed6b0a8645d9f5","f2620e9bd8e97f44d42610549523c2d81281c6d7","752fc67d89c018bd16d065bdd794943b182fa64e","921283511f66cca37d2cb8403d03fa6cc881bdf3","579e0ec24e5e206b20d29a27f6a64af66a39e58b","bedbfa5aaa5f85a62126b71d35c88d98505be02e","9cb958f7ff0f20bc1fefffc617e15174c3ed0a86","08a554c1afc888a9b5139090cee39abb2e9ec2ed","b2cd96beec70537546d5c6fcb0f6b7911446d278","adc18a6a28db7c12190b6827711074594d7ed297","c6e6900074c37683eecdf5beb18dd70fa151bccf","6eff71ddcc2d1746660fe1aabf9b4299c941308d","3ae09289cf891c19c2daa6c12f873a8cf839cda1"],"title":"Detecting multiple change points in piecewise constant hazard functions.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2011.559209"}

Yet, designing a dose-ranging trial is a challenging task, as it requires identifying the therapeutic window and the shape of the dose-response curve for a new drug on the basis of a limited number of doses. Adaptive designs have been proposed as a solution to improve both quality and efficiency of Phase II trials as they give the possibility to select the dose to be tested as the trial goes. In this article, we present a 'shapebased' two-stage adaptive trial design where the doses to be tested in the second stage are determined based on the correlation observed between efficacy of the doses tested in the first stage and a set of pre-specified candidate dose-response profiles. At the end of the trial, the data are analyzed using the generalized MCP-Mod approach in order to account for model uncertainty. A simulation study shows that this approach gives more precise estimates of a desired target dose (e.g. ED70) than a single-stage (fixed-dose) design and performs as well as a two-stage D-optimal design. We present the results of an adaptive model-based dose-ranging trial in multiple sclerosis that motivated this research and was conducted using the presented methodology.","inCitations":["2ba7d8210c377203f8078ff7d6c71e163dadf23e","e60e73a0b703f844a031c6c55a2e090c62ea9dfe"],"title":"Characterization of dose-response for count data using a generalized MCP-Mod approach in an adaptive dose-ranging trial.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1693"}

If the classes are similar biologically, then the number of genes that are differentially expressed between the classes is likely to be small compared to the total number of genes measured. This motivates a two-step process for predictor development, a subset of differentially expressed genes is selected for use in the predictor and then the predictor constructed from these. Both these steps will introduce variability into the resulting classifier, so both must be incorporated in sample size estimation. We introduce a methodology for sample size determination for prediction in the context of high-dimensional data that captures variability in both steps of predictor development. The methodology is based on a parametric probability model, but permits sample size computations to be carried out in a practical manner without extensive requirements for preliminary data. We find that many prediction problems do not require a large training set of arrays for classifier development.","inCitations":["a4d7ba356221bca9d0aba10b861ea0367a68814e","aa6246b2150acb460e75b068a0136ac33bc868fb","0de979b492ab21d1079a0c92182662b01f71088b","2bf9a8e995298ef6beb0ba86a9c1c291d89ab111","7065821183507bde38333d02482cb2aa95a3e805","b3e7cbb603d112249bfef710e4012012f9b55a6a","a8436bb956d9ebaca2fb6674f75348e82a7b3cfb","2b954ad9298f1992e8cef02412ba29b0e5f9a7ed","c930e691e41249d8d06cc659c5c34e64e947b0b8","52532c47516852e7dca8e33f60a6350a22d85322","49559690266220a81735d5808993cae26e8ab752","7d934d277abfe507631f9d181effa40ffad3fd38","d7e763d8b9e65a1e702969c16528d7070521b198","c9966fd72a47ce77d6ffbdf2e23a50a6c94ebe45","83c5373a127e69252e3fffeeb47458e76d7be93e","b745c853d2460e7f3e9ef5e774aeb0b00f3993a3","f633739fc1413ef73d687f585c0ae82988d0d02a","ac78b559b6cde8270f884f22ea405b851912748d","f2fa75eca029d658706b5920ea4f03be3fb61540","a21de9f6408b333d917f7a8b2585230ed8b6c57a","0e43bce602bf615530ba33d47f19aae31d5d84bb","b57e6862d494f689933afd4bbce402ff94e92f6c","4582ee4a0d6614c9e6b767770c89722484d39598","d3d0d97f2e24fc17e94549544800b8705065e304","92e07d92b87f57f8a48d7ce361c14560ebe9ba65","7452927c19290c34d3274473d6af4becf26a095d","f9679f4b0aef84b0acabf38596c05f08019cf878","5547549d78dd4cdb61017fc432f17a1920006096","7c7aabeef6a9e5e1b01da076ed1dc34903ef907f","d8f7147dc8b443e300bf1d145277e1acfbeb48c5","8b3a446d02ee1b6fbb475368e6b3bdaee93fa23a","8e544ad961e929cd2e8df4cdd45745807fc284ce","0c12a2d79368a2ce33e4b8da4b2c2c668e88754f","ff67836b02a1402aea9be8bcfa1b41f52903194e","8740c2fdbb971991b300b8ffb78b996bb274f4cb","3b5eec57b0987359dbf7a33498af2846dabe2fd9","a5135cadc02d2bd84b759effe818cbce17a80b34","b4a3b1d964bcfa267fbb03e038435755ce3abc88","ddaa0fef52fa71c131d79d0413a0b6c4ccb9ff82","25074ebf1c5d15793d73878155634a2b448c0de9","db64dfac09fa08f141fbc69ead71dc295ba9c355","db6b49c2edd7010700612e6ed46771f8e421c8ff","dcbc0f689ad5591f38d6bee920c8e2401acb6356","ca29682ac25184c3854b39d634308184f3ce896f","50608c7904a33c8dfd131fd5ccf683e7140d0fd3","d0e1d5778df11fa81f3a2c4317a3b457fae6cdd2","21a5ad0a49a378e33c7bb4bbe5010e95f19b8ec3","032e8a50220afdcf45800027aaba5c21dbce53db","d8b04f5d052bc416ba25329c61f7f3ef44e0d30b","6ca93530df2a83dcb1963459266eefb54429ff9f","77896d85d1596997c01971735aec6461cb995d4a","637dcd85606abb2d6e3211c404c4c37e76d782cb","e3200f0ee6f6bcb3fd3b038a5a75919a162a7021","67f679579df4e022318a80591645133a87f6c162","81bdd7b0f250f5fcebea07b2aa65cc597de2be62","00cb4338b45afd612a0dc692c60279ffbdb52cb0","4256c9ac49284e98242b50e961cf33769ec37a51","0d576223c9fa9ae39aec5222737df45f3f433529","8bc398d299c868d68bd27c9f27347b1f6ed1fd15","d2cca0413c2f26ab49c9cf53877e1457426acdff","c62c900873f4abc1c65ab443e761639c3e9ae031","7e7d0f7a9493e55c245250a3f330ff382bf003cb","bec1152da4c2669d4030084c226527c45aea24b9","b636c897045ccd5330b8edd7f9ee3ca0ec8a6246","5b156ad69f7024dacccde4e334d98761e27682b5","f043eb2f4f2528e909b8154e75f69822277facdb","4f9c2137b6b8c8056997c8a72685d61a8695b3c3","19bdc54f596194217bf822f91f937519c5479dd7","001e2b89d5b92c64c1b735acc0306ddcc15e6246"],"title":"Sample size planning for developing classifiers using high-dimensional DNA microarray data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj036"}

This article is focused on discovering the functional diversification within a protein family. A Bayesian mixture approach is proposed to model a protein family as a mixture of profile hidden Markov models. For a given mixture size, a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler comprising both Gibbs sampling steps and hierarchical clustering-based split/merge proposals is used to obtain posterior inference. Inference for mixture size concentrates on comparing the integrated likelihoods. The choice of priors is critical with respect to the performance of the procedure. Through simulation studies, we show that 2 priors that are based on independent data sets allow correct identification of the mixture size, both when the data are homogeneous and when the data are generated from a mixture. We illustrate our method using 2 sets of real protein sequences.","inCitations":["eab808f762c36ca187e199becd054b4c7649d78d","b8ac1e16589b18e38bc590cb74e8fbe1a062f9b4"],"title":"Bayesian mixture modeling using a hybrid sampler with application to protein subfamily identification.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp033"}

As advocated in textbooks and articles, the assumption of normality is often checked by a preliminary goodness-of-fit (GOF) test. In a paper recently published by Schucany and Ng it was shown that, for the uniform distribution, screening of samples by a pretest for normality leads to a more conservative conditional Type I error rate than application of the one-sample t-test without preliminary GOF test. In contrast, for the exponential distribution, the conditional level is even more elevated than the Type I error rate of the t-test without pretest. We examine the reasons behind these characteristics. In a simulation study, samples drawn from the exponential, lognormal, uniform, Student's t-distribution with 2 degrees of freedom (t(2) ) and the standard normal distribution that had passed normality screening, as well as the ingredients of the test statistics calculated from these samples, are investigated. For non-normal distributions, we found that preliminary testing for normality may change the distribution of means and standard deviations of the selected samples as well as the correlation between them (if the underlying distribution is non-symmetric), thus leading to altered distributions of the resulting test statistics. It is shown that for skewed distributions the excess in Type I error rate may be even more pronounced when testing one-sided hypotheses.","inCitations":["b8cde8e81bdb5c09d31a0ebab257db8883bc05a1","61de8bc6fb9bb8cb8f06b8cbb4ec9de1474a8a4c","67a04a460b41f3dfcceedfd162a14a9062cb7710","692344619fdf799e1db9dc7e3464b242ae5b7d21","f9752b51fcd41b9ef4ad1d1e0d054d00fef2e89d","6d78491953ec07685b5796384d2b26195044d1fb"],"title":"A closer look at the effect of preliminary goodness-of-fit testing for normality for the one-sample t-test.","doi":"10.1348/2044-8317.002003"}

The two endpoints are modeled by the multinomial distribution. The design is optimal in that it minimizes the patient exposure when the experimental therapies are inactive. The design parameters are found by a grid searching algorithm under type I and type II error rate constraints.

This framework generalizes several existing approaches, including methods to predict a scalar outcome from a tensor, a matrix from a matrix, or a tensor from a scalar. We describe an approach that exploits the multiway structure of both the predictors and the outcomes by restricting the coefficients to have reduced CP-rank. We propose a general and efficient algorithm for penalized least-squares estimation, which allows for a ridge (L 2) penalty on the coefficients. The objective is shown to give the mode of a Bayesian posterior, which motivates a Gibbs sampling algorithm for inference. We illustrate the approach with an application to facial image data.

However, in situations where the quantile coefficients share some common feature, joint modeling of multiple quantiles to accommodate the commonality often leads to more efficient estimation. One example of common features is that a predictor may have a constant effect over one region of quantile levels but varying effects in other regions. To automatically perform estimation and detection of the interquantile commonality, we develop two penalization methods. When the quantile slope coefficients indeed do not change across quantile levels, the proposed methods will shrink the slopes towards constant and thus improve the estimation efficiency. We establish the oracle properties of the two proposed penalization methods. Through numerical investigations, we demonstrate that the proposed methods lead to estimations with competitive or higher efficiency than the standard quantile regression estimation in finite samples.

The scientific interest in such study may lie in the estimation of treatment effect while accounting for the correlation among event times. The correlation among recurrent event times come from two sources: subject-specific heterogeneity (e.g., varied lifestyles, genetic variations, and other unmeasurable effects) and event dependence (i.e., event incidences may change the risk of future recurrent events). Moreover, event incidences may change the disease progression so that there may exist event-varying covariate effects (the covariate effects may change after each event) and event effect (the effect of prior events on the future events). In this article, we propose a Bayesian regression model that not only accommodates correlation among recurrent events from both sources, but also explicitly characterizes the event-varying covariate effects and event effect. This model is especially useful in quantifying how the incidences of events change the effects of covariates and risk of future events. We compare the proposed model with several commonly used recurrent event models and apply our model to the motivating lipid-lowering trial (LLT) component of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) (ALLHAT-LLT).","inCitations":["79aad3c0385dd39a4e7b8a52c0b1e5a1b7d8fd2a"],"title":"Bayesian regression model for recurrent event data with event-varying covariate effects and event effect.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2017.1367368"}

As a function of these rates, a microtubule can grow steadily or its length can fluctuate wildly. For μ = 0, we find the exact tubule and GTP cap length distributions, and power-law length distributions of GTP and GDP islands. For μ = ∞, we argue that the time between catastrophes, where the microtubule shrinks to zero length, scales as e(λ).

The concept is illustrated by using it to develop a method that averages results from the t-test and nonparametric rank-sum test with weights obtained from using the Shapiro-Wilk test to test the assumption of normality. Through this averaging process, the proposed method is able to rely more heavily on the statistical test that the data suggests is superior for each individual gene. Subsequently, this method developed by assumption adequacy averaging outperforms its two component methods (the t-test and rank-sum test) in a series of traditional and bootstrap-based simulation studies. The proposed method showed greater concordance in gene selection across two studies of gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia than did the t-test or rank-sum test.

However, advanced statistical methods for analyzing such data and drawing proper inference remain limited. The objectives of this paper are (1) to provide new spatio-temporal methodology that combines data from both roving and static sensors for data processing and hazard mapping across space and over time in an indoor environment, and (2) to compare the new method with the current industry practice, demonstrating the distinct advantages of the new method and the impact on occupational hazard assessment and future policy making in environmental health as well as occupational health. A novel spatio-temporal model with a continuous index in both space and time is proposed, and a profile likelihood-based model fitting procedure is developed that allows fusion of the two types of data. To account for potential differences between the static and roving sensors, we extend the model to have nonhomogenous measurement error variances. Our methodology is applied to a case study conducted in an engine test facility, and dynamic hazard maps are drawn to show features in the data that would have been missed by existing approaches, but are captured by the new method.","inCitations":["0f470f408800a3387d49aada301b8f8cf300c602","f24933d335dbe26ee4d45447300fbc316b72e119"],"title":"Static and Roving Sensor Data Fusion for Spatio-temporal Hazard Mapping with Application to Occupational Exposure Assessment.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS995"}

However, partial survival information are available from backward recurrence times and are frequently collected from health surveys without prospective follow-up. Under length-biased sampling, a class of linear rank statistics is proposed based only on backward recurrence times without any prospective follow-up. When follow-up data are available, the proposed rank statistic and a conventional rank statistic that utilizes follow-up information from the same sample are shown to be asymptotically independent. We discuss four ways to combine these two statistics when follow-up is present. Simulations show that all combined statistics have substantially improved power compared with conventional rank statistics, and a Mantel-Haenszel test performed the best among the proposal statistics. The method is applied to a cross-sectional health survey without follow-up and a study of Alzheimer's disease with prospective follow-up.","inCitations":["5d0168ab41e03ae0f18f04ebf9193080e912a3ae"],"title":"Rank-based testing of equal survivorship based on cross-sectional survival data with or without prospective follow-up.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv011"}

Often, these indices are combined into a graphical representation, the isobologram. Instead of estimating the combination indices at the experimental mixture ratios only, we propose a simple parametric model for estimating the underlying interaction function. We integrate this approach into a joint model where both the parameters of the dose-response functions of the singular substances and the interaction parameters can be estimated simultaneously. As an additional benefit, this concept allows to determine optimal statistical designs for combination studies optimizing the estimation of the interaction function as a whole. From an optimal design perspective, finding the interaction parameters generally corresponds to a [Formula: see text]-optimality resp. [Formula: see text]-optimality design problem, while estimation of all underlying dose response parameters corresponds to a [Formula: see text]-optimality design problem. We show how optimal designs can be obtained in either case as well as how combination designs providing reasonable performance in regard to both criteria can be determined by putting a constraint on the efficiency in regard to one of the criteria and optimizing for the other. As all designs require prior information about model parameter values, which may be unreliable in practice, the effect of misspecifications is investigated as well.","inCitations":["f7c9125c0503dcaf054cc45f70243f72684e1a27"],"title":"Parametric modeling and optimal experimental designs for estimating isobolograms for drug interactions in toxicology.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1397005"}

We continuously monitor the trial by using the predictive probability. The trial is terminated early when it is shown that one treatment is overwhelmingly superior to others or that all the treatments are equivalent. We develop two methods to compute the predictive probability by considering the uncertainty of the sample size of the future data. We illustrate the proposed Bayesian adaptive randomization and predictive probability design by using a phase II lung cancer clinical trial, and we conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design. By coupling adaptive randomization and predictive probability approaches, the trial can treat more patients with a more efficacious treatment and allow for early stopping whenever sufficient information is obtained to conclude treatment superiority or equivalence.

It is unclear whether methods for confounding adjustment that have been shown to perform well in small, simple nonrandomized studies are applicable to the large, complex pharmacoepidemiologic studies created from secondary healthcare data. Ordinary simulation approaches for evaluating the performance of statistical methods do not capture important features of healthcare claims. A statistical framework for creating replicated simulation datasets from an empirical cohort study in electronic healthcare claims data is developed and validated. The approach relies on resampling from the observed covariate and exposure data without modification in all simulated datasets to preserve the associations among these variables. Repeated outcomes are simulated using a true treatment effect of the investigator's choice and the baseline hazard function estimated from the empirical data. As an example, this framework is applied to a study of high versus low-intensity statin use and cardiovascular outcomes. Simulated data is based on real data drawn from Medicare Parts A and B linked with a prescription drug insurance claims database maintained by Caremark. Properties of the data simulated using this framework are compared with the empirical data on which the simulations were based. In addition, the simulated datasets are used to compare variable selection strategies for confounder adjustmentvia the propensity score, including high-dimensional approaches that could not be evaluated with ordinary simulation methods. The simulated datasets are found to closely resemble the observed complex data structure but have the advantage of an investigator-specified exposure effect.","inCitations":["4a47531a0bea2f01dfddce581e2694f36e49f30f","7918859956b0be0e0d79561ce3d300d928fd1bd5","047060cdb68bda4b092a514607fb1387e228b05f","767d7671cda39de359f5bcfe2d41ac49c906b780","3b0a883e8590c9731db309240e1750f740670135","237091fafea40e814c379b169d05b510b3b389bd","d47b4aaec98dae0902c83a788476f55ebaed6bbb","17749565c9de6623ecef2b61caf1ece2bacc6757","ee7e6fa6b03b7a6780df045a230b53acd164a537","0c44f163ff40f0241cb8d6ba47c81a4a80961887","7efd60c6b7458d6087d062e25b06f6ead84b4c2c","6a9ab7ac50dda89c802932a7c06bdeb74ac1b169","6ab5ac55f01f2aca776ead3f1657623f53b4294f","dd92e689301bee87324faae1736e156b847bf8b6","788d367ce18d82f6f286abc2687c9bcd0eb29ed5","6d14b6ee8f22752ac7240e944d975344f4f2b58b","6ce72fcbe684ed330c52995a9614fa1434b3be87","4ac4be740e7d2c3bd2b67b42c9c24172207e79fb","645f29d2f796ed91174643ac5248f9f48b5aa857","2181c3ddc42679990352d925fc77bfd3b190ec0f","484ee72f010cf2c59f28b6c6f0d77ec9f1e05ca0","f846cab195eae61297895031e28e3c517a523ac9","afbd2ad680887ea5480e60bfd84fa6fb90b23f60","a6b144b3348f5ea704f97c79cb6635a639f7ef01","b4d7ecac98fb93e2f869f1ce3bfb091aaaf05257","a919c7af73627a8676e0e117d08541ca391dc731","6fb5c8c8dc5c5a165f850d4bdf481665dcd60024","4ac1b16884a753ad06c45b5418a2d0257809918b","e5055b71cf3b139c0bdb8af53746e378a5a24270","831259d19c81d4c48e6507cb19eaf5c70198ada0","275a386a8e14e618de17c8780ab970a45a0b4505","f538b19d642e9ed50b082eb5b64f80e20b464ed3","d901577cf2b93f5964999ac014ce1111f2854577","1d34b7f1581767f14723aa98bdfc06b0fcf88943","19b2aa08970ac1473a53f996a50e2d83c8ae7958","e19cbab9fb23d5170e65bda39926dd5da2d1c138","cfe3c516b6945f71ed73ee919f6ecf4d4e353555"],"title":"Plasmode simulation for the evaluation of pharmacoepidemiologic methods in complex healthcare databases","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2013.10.018"}

We develop a model with 3-level mean structure effects, all stratified by treatment and subject random effects, including a general subject effect and nested effects for the 3 levels. The mean and random structures are specified as smooth curves measured at various time points. The association structure of the 3-level data is induced through the random curves, which are summarized using a few important principal components. We use penalized splines to model the mean curves and the principal component curves, and cast the proposed model into a mixed effects model framework for model fitting, prediction and inference. We develop an algorithm to fit the model iteratively with the Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) version of the EM algorithm and eigenvalue decompositions. Selection of the number of principal components and handling incomplete data issues are incorporated into the algorithm. The performance of the Wald-type hypothesis test is also discussed. The method is applied to the physical activity data and evaluated empirically by a simulation study.","inCitations":["c99de8e8797078d97122552957d3346341d52bdc","03eadbab9d117412ba27ba08be3a03ef6c8cda89","3fe24d6d95b680e14579de89db87619faa16a536","3447b283310b3417a43192e0460aef4de4d29fb3","8902fefb4d415ec84c88a85b21d2d04ff06ac84d"],"title":"Methods to assess an exercise intervention trial based on 3-level functional data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv015"}

The models considered vary from approximate methods to an exact method. The approximate methods include the Poisson process model and methods that are based on discretization of the study window. The exact method includes a marked point process model, i.e., the conditional logistic model. Apart from analyzing a real dataset (Lancashire larynx cancer data), a small simulation study is also carried out to examine the ability of these methods to recover known parameter values. The main results are as follows. In estimating the distance effect of larynx cancer incidences from the incinerator, the conditional logistic model and the binomial model for the discretized window perform relatively well. In explaining the spatial heterogeneity, the Poisson model (or the log Gaussian Cox process model) for the discretized window produces the best estimate.","inCitations":["d72f4d2fe1705e1e2129d74b51bdeb519a246f18","206f09ef538d6fd5bff075edfb005d9db67b9592","8c17d7e5a10ba616a11242df4fc91294d85a639e","36c436682ebb02d785db70464f865f83015dbbc0","d939b650b725d6ed7117850250488590b2cc92be","fd3e8eb8f3ff38919388336f155a2de4696bbd92","6c51e6e29d973bc718ea2846a47bc5432c5c92c3","41874574794296b3e3be5a572a4a53f66d4b32f4","3e8110137d73ca66c10153ea70316a3a312008da","e16e031a6030152e9ef23df4d60ca0d110a3565f","2dba79fcc98d206170a74682a831c4a54b8b8531","98439927c56833efdb46cf4f8f540bf7440d8099","76e56c06d39b3e3b027f885b4715e10c4d331336","71aceb83a89425e32da8b51d3b76b74a80d69fb5","6f56a2b310e9541a1ef20ad6dbf453df37542476","a5ed0ee2f5bd2f505fbb2f3677ed3e4e91aaa15d"],"title":"Approximate methods in Bayesian point process spatial models","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.05.017"}

Such ‘profiles’ carry all signal events during processing of a particular stimulus and during initiation of a particular response. It is argued that cross-correlation of activity profiles supplies a measure for the separability of nervous substructures used in the process of the nearly simultaneous formation of two different responses. It turns out that the common psychophysical practice of measuring the probability of occurrence of particular stimulus-response pairs gives sufficient information to calculate the cross-correlation of ‘profiles’. Two experimental paradigms have been worked out: one with compound stimuli in two modalities, vision and audition; the other with a two-dimensional judgement (pitch and lateralization) of stimuli in a single modality.","inCitations":["6310775a6bc5e349fa26f632a06310f586d046e6"],"title":"Psychophysical system identification by correlation methods.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1978.tb00587.x"}

The second improvement modifies the output of OPT or LL-OPT and produces a continuous piecewise linear density estimate. We demonstrate the performance of these two improvements using simulated and real date examples.","inCitations":["3b804545834420a95c6897ed79d292f13057b69f","b89e2aaf8eaf048c920da9a9c45eb566869c7989","98886f5561831b345bde54879dc14d31e6d75773"],"title":"Computational Aspects of Optional Pólya Tree.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2014.1002927"}

The method invokes multiple imputation (MI) for the missing failure times under a variety of specifications regarding the post-withdrawal tendency for having the event of interest. With a clinical trial example, we compared methods of covariance analyses for time-to-event data, i.e., the multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) model and nonparametric analysis of covariance, and then illustrated how to incorporate these methods into the proposed sensitivity analysis for covariate adjustment. The MI methods considered are Kaplan-Meier multiple imputation and covariate-adjusted and unadjusted PH multiple imputation. The assumptions, statistical issues, and features for these methods are discussed.","inCitations":["16038b429632454b1aaffcc3af4af2096f3e33c3","3994d55da7bb1edc8d220b7801fff1ec8315abaa"],"title":"Sensitivity analysis for missing outcomes in time-to-event data with covariate adjustment.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.1000549"}

Similar concerns apply to interval estimates for treatment differences in this setting, though their properties are less well known. Standard permutation tests are one option, but these are not in general valid when the underlying censoring distributions in the comparison groups are unequal. We develop 2 methods for testing and interval estimation, for use with small samples and possibly unequal censoring, based on first imputing survival and censoring times and then applying permutation methods. One provides a heuristic justification for the approach proposed recently by Heinze and others (2003, Exact log-rank tests for unequal follow-up. Biometrics 59, 1151-1157). Simulation studies show that the proposed methods have good Type I error and power properties. For accelerated failure time models, compared to the asymptotic methods of Jin and others (2003, Rank-based inference for the accelerated failure time model.

Specifically, we consider the setting of functional data with a multilevel structure of the form groups-clusters or subjects-units, where the unit-level profiles are spatially correlated within the cluster, and the cluster-level data are independent. Orthogonal series expansions are used to approximate the group mean functions and the test statistic is estimated using the basis coefficients. The asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic is developed, under mild regularity conditions. To our knowledge this is the first work that studies hypothesis testing, when data have such complex multilevel functional and spatial structure. Two small-sample alternatives, including a novel block bootstrap for functional data, are proposed, and their performance is examined in simulation studies. The paper concludes with an illustration of a motivating experiment.","inCitations":["c6050bfbe755c80b2d9e3549b13be59be62e98c2","95bc1bdeff3a441adeb43d89f0278e0999bfa439","998e54a0cf8bec478bb5224a4beed2a112ecb03a","51ecf586567338171f60c48b532242a62124858c","297f54108d026936a321d723fe922e7b45cbd576","4e2b3b67ff1b7dcce722f8271528684503517696","47b35b50ee7f321a2e38776d09b5cf7d63699d1b","ca0b7c24310ad067ca9f3f522485b2f7e527597c"],"title":"Significance tests for functional data with complex dependence structure.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2014.08.006"}

It allows an estimate of the correlation between the two response variables and takes into account this correlation for the estimation of other model parameters. This model was applied in a large cohort study (APROCO Cohort) to study the evolution under antiretroviral treatment of the two major biomarkers of the progression of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection: plasma HIV RNA and CD4+ T lymphocytes cell count. In a sample of 929 patients who started an highly active antiretroviral therapy, we illustrate the superiority in terms of likelihood of a bivariate model compared to two univariate models and the impact of taking into account the left-censoring of HIV-RNA. Moreover, interpretation of the model parameters allows confirmation of correlation between these two markers throughout the whole follow-up and the continuous decrease of plasma HIV RNA on average. Despite some limitations (distribution assumption, ignorance of missingness process), such a model appeared to be very useful to correctly describe the current evolution of important biomarkers in HIV infection.","inCitations":["211274e1f43aa76c50ac551ba77c51ca37a633b4","89705520cdc6072a06ac94404370848befade6b9","7cad9c5861df1f6f4424c18ec54ee73ed8e1ce00","2e7e2a667ccdd67d2e8603f3c26ce4306fb8de36","c493b4ebef85a41df813a9c02c3696eb5ddb3a8b","c358dc2b14e0e233a23aaf8c3c0904c5a0cf7594","5e72042a6a9317b08427091a3526be600f11be53","af5708242788ac5e8ee47419c5976621efa50180"],"title":"Bivariate longitudinal model for the analysis of the evolution of HIV RNA and CD4 cell count in HIV infection taking into account left censoring of HIV RNA measures.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120019271"}

A common strategy is to employ a spatial model such as universal kriging to predict exposures at locations with outcome data and then estimate a regression parameter of interest using the predicted exposures. This results in measurement error because the predicted exposures do not correspond exactly to the true values. We characterize the measurement error by decomposing it into Berkson-like and classical-like components. One correction approach is the parametric bootstrap, which is effective but computationally intensive since it requires solving a nonlinear optimization problem for the exposure model parameters in each bootstrap sample. We propose a less computationally intensive alternative termed the \"parameter bootstrap\" that only requires solving one nonlinear optimization problem, and we also compare bootstrap methods to other recently proposed methods. We illustrate our methodology in simulations and with publicly available data from the Environmental Protection Agency.","inCitations":["b7432f133309c19c3c19c6cce4073c9c5c0d8ba9","18baa6fa0bfa9c70874a7470acd54785c365789f","3f77a0acf2a04bd63f8cc47eaca860fcf9adf395","662dfe4a02d626d32b3cab150b82d6287ee6413a","0b556cd373f4ba48d4d8997f45d2a4af58f8ecab","250d85b54a0554f16f3e7a826d1f6775a2cda890","a2640ce92a8a0e1ee201360b4ff43e355a5f99bd","fa3ae1a12c8d398d200195d58143aa4006bbd7ef","968f38678a8dbaf3d4e56aeed4613f30006966c2","9d51c6989f89b52d284abba3072470b831e563ac","a560deab06a75dccd7337d9c149ed5b33cddd9fb","5a689983620754b5f4da40df8c57d678c056f30c","bace0cc082a2dd1ece949be7e07393b5e6bd6b9e","f4f125222d30430985ee1a252c6cc0cc14adcc79","e420e146a693955775c1ef7d889d189c03f3f64c","b8b1d5b85a7d2b1a9ab2dfdec6249e2b5a226f79","02153b0e7301686fa4bdeddf95f60e954e858e88","e20522d6c5e208fd08348c95645e5daa8c4a0154","c5b8ca1af823464e35b1b98227a121d7e18f32e4","53b1b4fff141bc6fae58f34c531032997687d591","58fb6d60345e1eb95a2185c559fa3e93e92bc560","ab05e999e5a61549c3497654ef54c88c6886d81f","c48fc5a0219e01247ae45b033c28b4e8d1cdf7e5","7392042a5351a89f6a4bd73894e928d390653b06","0b965eec89c0e77852b0fd408d941db90926be82","298449e5708ca223a7393462cb9515e6aebd854f","9acdfc07a39d33a0eb904facccdcf93268f67f01","70f96faf65978b0ac2dda4afae7a3744356fd448","af9aab45278200ed6eebc39f9ef047a833af1e04","cbcee14b3666efbf99256a24f834dad4e86acd29","c4dbead7603f1c871d53e90ccf24a0b6338604a8","ed314086444143ca2c5d62176948a63f9644e657","f89ec810fe487427c6decc7f0f9ad5ebb557c5a8","e4412c70b81e311acb06f9f68803d9b49918fe45","254753c1dac458fca10907025aa44dc09551a647","650e16cedf08abebd9818d98c0b62ed0424d8cc3","f3faf7d6479bae42c66d56524b581f2abfae1d91","7636af856e669c3df9dc62627535d31e679a8a85","a38a1703cbd8c2df61ce770cdd4ad1f9d44789ed","f37ccc0e93a052bb426205d6aba050effcdde253","81a524abca7e356c0428f3b8b80f1639762d2049","752fc410e0c7c89ad883396744b4751952b66a21","72d74b5b5dfe7aa66c06462e90d56c65af26efce","bf5c7c7bb64bcbf3381d5732f97c4c2c22455f3b","bf7544533ff228448d1e93d6f5129781be0887ca","628f86f2c6739bad11916e74d60289ee516ed61e","49df3fd5c707fe7611f7b28835f90808a051599a","0f44fdcb9c4c2e3bb38379af2142487f9f0347da","90f714ebdd8bb245775f0e472ee636c4f1072bbf","d016420d244caa241c52c62bb2502c85f7048fcc","cc327881e09049c0cc228876ad8d399d42ba6ae6","2316504bd1bfa8812abe2f0b31c6bdc0d6aa40ed","a5ed0ee2f5bd2f505fbb2f3677ed3e4e91aaa15d","836c042dd6c81a46c8872fb08c655974fb753189","b6285411e2fd8cd3b84a4918aa4dd645b399fe51","464e96212db6609a89295b120ce968600d9f6086","7700190ed77117da00063e642c84ae05ae715a3a","2d2cfb6ba06d3e98d89e9e2946aa62d248205db3","e316edd2b3281912da6d5c7429ea2395916cbd2e","a518b56a419472e4209991d1ae4c64d968a4920b","3190fbefb04c8b75229d7574f29ad90d63e19f43","beb76974abbae5f218afaada2c4b65de663f4ae7","dfe9949131f4714f8676414534f208e705876049","52628c848b71ea7c0ce2ecac453e1a7c792b61cf","58f372f3568507b91b85bee3fbbf62f7a29d1ab9","c7def332ce866159a64b9131eca528e37758b573","9b2b284241ffd336d4fc361745efcaaeac312b9d","61afa234e202b4c0575c86cb178d71687a36b899","9f5c1b2b4ec7653d53cbf24c4741b5e6ca744b38","625a5e2ed82ab79add29df4327b12de18e3603f1","20d8e3a35efdf5918f972f42e9938383c87c190f"],"title":"Efficient measurement error correction with spatially misaligned data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq083"}

A recent finding by Tomlins and others (2005) is of a different type of pattern of differential expression in which a fraction of samples in one group have overexpression relative to samples in the other group. In this work, we describe a general mixture model framework for the assessment of this type of expression, called outlier profile analysis. We start by considering the single-gene situation and establishing results on identifiability. We propose 2 nonparametric estimation procedures that have natural links to familiar multiple testing procedures.

To relate categories to attributes, a category-level Q-matrix is used. When the attribute and category association is specified a priori, the proposed model has the flexibility to allow different cognitive processes (e.g., conjunctive, disjunctive) to be modelled at different categories within a single item. This model can be extended for items where categories cannot be explicitly linked to attributes, and for items with unordered categories. The feasibility of the proposed model is examined using simulated data. The proposed model is illustrated using the data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2007 assessment.","inCitations":["41060fa6b1203758b48a10117b216570d5ca3985","368a1651c73af918fd39c4d1438889b51aa44493","3b84dda2dc0d871cde045a2597f7cdfbe550e64c","59d4e7d869d8faab378f776c4cc157e2d22e1044","9ccffe170699492d22aa09306bfeadafef224942","5c21884349d7ad87d31337d081f3330df8beb47e","1fba4d5a2532bafc3e19a651ea950da73192f273","c5cc0b4d620aafebb090b72a510698e4ac791a7d","e7691f8c0aaee62a38a2c92e989ba1efb2e3da2f","77928929d1f22f0a950676806299c878759dff73","b878feddce7fb3285f11a7c53a844924db36e86f"],"title":"A sequential cognitive diagnosis model for polytomous responses.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12070"}

However, the accuracy of such a risk estimator is largely unknown. We study factor-based risk estimators under a large amount of assets, and introduce a high-confidence level upper bound (H-CLUB) to assess the estimation. The H-CLUB is constructed using the confidence interval of risk estimators with either known or unknown factors. We derive the limiting distribution of the estimated risks in high dimensionality. We find that when the dimension is large, the factor-based risk estimators have the same asymptotic variance no matter whether the factors are known or not, which is slightly smaller than that of the sample covariance-based estimator. Numerically, H-CLUB outperforms the traditional crude bounds, and provides an insightful risk assessment. In addition, our simulated results quantify the relative error in the risk estimation, which is usually negligible using 3-month daily data.","inCitations":["fb58e9fd61829045802ca42d9aae34670fa1a065","9138182644dd05a9d84d772cb29c463ac9a9e9a3","4c93ea4e4e605786d590acf5639662a14a2060fa","80214d0a0c51d044ef4e95dd55d5a46004a45981","bf468213c8802bfea7dbaf78ebb9f98dfe8ee195","5c76597e54f884bc4ad3d79e4f1ffb685aeadfb4","d84e9bfe7072f9f0bdf702d4e3d90e7d14620379","4b7b7b3d36f9d8aa1374a3782d28c1846d2a0a5a","4297ef2cc28704b6c2a63f447fc3fe6e927d2335","22ce54fbd486754c6aef6e24543e81bddc5594a6","4bbaac5942adaecd417fdb3aa73eaedb50550afa","780d7fd941b8987c2228c3c947cb7634798c4674","d8fcfc53ddf20b415640bbe764119064a8d51d6a","99d3dc8ad0cf22b144a145d9a83b279a88c24e01","629201384405a694d42f438d38b25cb886509f03","a26c957cac1ef5c59b60b50999e5f3e65cbf33d1","4272cb2a24cfa44ac798b55089e95203d50293ec","eeafb23a1aa23d6192d5f1f5bc50c3651ca61e7a"],"title":"Risks of Large Portfolios.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.02.015"}
