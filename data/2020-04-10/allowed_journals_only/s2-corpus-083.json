{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":1994,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"For the determination of bioequivalence, researchers have recently shifted their emphasis from average bioequivalence alone to average and individual bioequivalence. Existing methods for assessing average bioequivalence were first developed for the standard 2 x 2 crossover design, but these methods are easily generalized to the two-treatment, p-period crossover designs (e.g., TRR, RTT, and TTRR, RRTT, TRRT, RTTR). With respect to individual bioequivalence, Westlake (1,2) implemented the use of parametric and distribution-free tolerance intervals for assessing individual bioequivalence. Anderson and Hauck (3) described what they call the test of individual equivalence ratios (TIER) for the same purpose. Note that these methods have been applied and/or developed only for the standard 2 x 2 crossover design. The present work extends the method of using parametric tolerance intervals for assessing individual bioequivalence.","inCitations":["d49f9ec8be916bb04b12e5a30924cd7ae62bb843","b38aee47fb486164fab56087be3d422e517884a5","5f621563eb736339fe804cdc8c273c1af3c919f3","4ae883ed90ce3e3959c4e6e395bb733588bf6678","d12d980ab30453ce19910cd69d743ea9592f3ca8","ca9c3024a19c861aa5ccbe67ce81b1969369781b","812a477385d204e9d390271e3d60e71513bc0b4b","6c0945c8740e5417e257ff662f2c52144bda1222","a75ea29dc5d9392fc3f202292d94f43f0c7508ea","a3cb405fd67cb3d94040531ef79d81307a4c408b","d774e5a9d7fc31835c30020ebcea0456c49365b5","ea994c3d9950ad47afe2c4d80c4de90d5afdd62a","b75ec9e3f685c6a53c2342fc647c02acbc7a19b0","59c3855902d34862ccb9c9130d6ba9e5a2a04d7f"],"title":"Extension to the use of tolerance intervals for the assessment of individual bioequivalence.","doi":"10.1080/10543409408835071"}

In a two-arm study with a binary endpoint, p-value based on the exact unconditional Barnard test is computed by maximizing the tail probability over a nuisance parameter with a range from 0 to 1. The traditional grid search method is able to find an approximate maximum with a partition of the parameter space, but it is not accurate and this approach becomes computationally intensive for a study beyond two groups. We propose using a polynomial method to rewrite the tail probability as a polynomial. The solutions from the derivative of the polynomial contain the solution for the global maximum of the tail probability. We use an example from a double-blind randomized Phase II cancer clinical trial to illustrate the application of the proposed polynomial method to achieve an accurate p-value. We also compare the performance of the proposed method and the traditional grid search method under various conditions. We would recommend using this new polynomial method in computing accurate exact unconditional p-values.","inCitations":["93fedfc3fd8e7006fcefb5cf58ca60b8a4a2fabd"],"title":"Accurate unconditional p-values for a two-arm study with binary endpoints.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2018.1425690"}

The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it proposes a new method to identify and estimate multiple diffusion directions within a voxel through a new and identifiable parametrization of the widely used multi-tensor model. Unlike many existing methods, this method focuses on the estimation of diffusion directions rather than the diffusion tensors. Second, this paper proposes a novel direction smoothing method which greatly improves direction estimation in regions with crossing fibers. This smoothing method is shown to have excellent theoretical and empirical properties. Last, this paper develops a fiber tracking algorithm that can handle multiple directions within a voxel. The overall methodology is illustrated with simulated data and a data set collected for the study of Alzheimer's disease by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).","inCitations":["f92b839b97f02ec025a2913ba515f89b390d4fe9","87fee188cbe848814edeaeb9a4b31438bd9ad51f","c041871c0912d347d76d5ffdde00a736e030334e","28d36d5be49a3a1f48b686e1d7039bfcca749112"],"title":"Fiber Direction Estimation, Smoothing and Tracking in Diffusion Mri.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS880"}

In contrast, survey and cohort studies contain more detailed data from a sample of the population. This paper describes Bayesian graphical models for fitting a common regression model to a combination of data sets with different sets of covariates. The methods are applied to a study of low birth weight and air pollution in England and Wales using a combination of register, survey, and small-area aggregate data. We discuss issues such as multiple imputation of confounding variables missing in one data set, survey selection bias, and appropriate propagation of information between model components. From the register data, there appears to be an association between low birth weight and environmental exposure to NO(2), but after adjusting for confounding by ethnicity and maternal smoking by combining the register and survey data under our models, we find there is no significant association. However, NO(2) was associated with a small but significant reduction in birth weight, modeled as a continuous variable.","inCitations":["d263a4a15936514b5e8f829e142fc61000e06f5e","61e74beab3381a683fa05e954459acebe9e35138","5e037778481b2c43c58dc51ec13ca315ce2c28d5","47a99b033fbfd236256aff4dc7653ea7a5f058fe","3a46863b9fdfd0b3f13af840491b448b7c61c8c3","10c354fc1843d73ad1d91c9f9953761c7c6d21bb","4099357bb674f03864ea9203b575b920162845ba","ba1f79a0763f3cb3e6ebaeb6d7c1f8da73865868","9b74dbda9e3df83513c0793e9c28b3bff3ba0d4f","4b57b3d9dd8a6dc964d02fe8633367ac30666689","e9e8fc9f2993ac37f84ec64ef259d5d441df6aaa","4682d477a92ce57615b94513870426bb4d3d8c92","580294a0365be2da9179d0aa90afd0536942474a","4923d06c71a1c3c851253bcff046b2af787a33a3","afb4acf67c1b06d18b13a2bad13dd27ca9ae7be1","6b02436e61a8d7f77e0efb9c838215d6147b75de","1ca0fd3b6b5ce575d9c8b955dbdcd1fa1e4b7b0a","0ae8cf2fc95e81ce08608de7287ae1d97d3a02ef","18a0565b733cadf8b1726893c4ee353a5611c705","b5c54ac6ea64bef7d2c31787626cdff1622c7fdc","7b734bb3bbd7badc2e50e62edd75649f0f19d818","10df93d834d6fe73917a6f48d0bad188deaf808f","134f0fe3d5034a3eb76aa6450933b9eee02c488f","b2709bac3e7eb326b75d0a6b609671bf5311d066","a57d532079d1b90a10be0f4af219919f7b3e88c5","17fc33514be5f84f9e7c199f29c730b06fab506d","c1f673cb5e8293f9fc2acece0195afe41076045f","22c712455f69666694e62394b91ffc8f3c675fbc","e90a5094de525781a412751ef5a025e8627a5065","b9a5706fea427466f243b527a0e83d695c493de7","5032baefe2fba280e388b5990aba06ff171e38ed"],"title":"Bayesian graphical models for regression on multiple data sets with different variables","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn041"}

Recently, there has been much interest in analyzing the joint SFS data from multiple populations to infer parameters of complex demographic histories, including variable population sizes, population split times, migration rates, admixture proportions, and so on. SFS-based inference methods require accurate computation of the expected SFS under a given demographic model. Although much methodological progress has been made, existing methods suffer from numerical instability and high computational complexity when multiple populations are involved and the sample size is large. In this paper, we present new analytic formulas and algorithms that enable accurate, efficient computation of the expected joint SFS for thousands of individuals sampled from hundreds of populations related by a complex demographic model with arbitrary population size histories (including piecewise-exponential growth). Our results are implemented in a new software package called momi (MOran Models for Inference). Through an empirical study we demonstrate our improvements to numerical stability and computational complexity.","inCitations":["a6e1afe6fdae06d3ac077049fa8b8239104044be","6eb3a76540fa5b9274529abf0930c7e5b0afc3cc","8d8e7d0d1a0262d312610c7384ae3bdf0d10ee7e","c073d3447a968534a9e75ff2c0c8989db652c357","9de47ae700ea4bb5dd0152a8536dcead94250674","bdf2c57540bd25bf3d37d1f052b58f1129e32387","748b799759f304d4f37a435db44f36ff0728fdf1","51718f759bc3f60ebbba0a6eb8e22a980a452c49","2207d14e25daa8ed67bf5ddd178b3ea1d675fbdd","e8d1cf6b481a9fef5ddc0e8abe565bef858f6d66","e2a0f274478024313ad97abfa722b202556c9e41","0858392e8c3632add9359be3eb007dc8027e5e30","e3e1d7d3ae94ffc119b7b0c7992a00f78b80132a","3cf0cdb0f4d2b35333aa138c086ac77b74c853d3","30a5b7a494f32565b34207003d41f6c8e39a0fe4","cf257ee62475b639dba4628c7194808bd9508cf6","cd5c53067db0344925456751455eca18629496ea","8772660ac57c4061fd7716705c17103759a90802","60bf7aef1576e0ba87b074ee1e6a7d6e810395ea","99a1e63c94849ba59ea927b789d1f6fc117c1f66","041764db8a4c2b52256652465c8c0fc505da6b42","93f4d77a68fa52a63c821794d59223285afe1dcf","8636e6f3f948fdc490f9c2845d1365f617a501c0","a95c393b8638ace0dfd596458eb8630b50a01514","18d4f6869d5a3c01701ff1c190bdae14dd818fd2","d81272c3c38a5326c280b5dde272d572e926e407","d1528e24b6ebf493083170e5c945f2bbb8dbfc66","2eca46783c32f62a495c9c9a18599cccae396990","fb84d369be3530ae09beb36b8da5268b77f543af","e72bc5d6a9875c2114bd8c5341fe0fd5cdef40f7","a5b821587b52d4ff6dfc6f5be22aca3b1d330238","54114e8b5bc749623546bf923fedc63c12f4b20f","43184199ac3c9f9631b65b2f5cd4db1519aa1026","94db3637e6fe20649669f76909844f5b0a96fad5","bc7f7f6eb2dc18490733d7253d9ef4412805aa87","05181c4a59fe8d96ce172860a3aa70bee95f5841","e514f5abe4639606a0719ab3cea0e9428646844b"],"title":"Efficient computation of the joint sample frequency spectra for multiple populations.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2016.1159212"}

The standard two-sequence, two-period crossover design, however, may not be useful when differential carryover effects are present. In addition, it does not provide independent estimates of intrasubject variabilities for the two formulations. To overcome these problems, alternatively, a higher-order crossover design may be considered. In this paper, we derive statistical methods based on Schuirmann's two one-sided tests procedure for assessing bioequivalence for some commonly used higher-order crossover designs. Four designs, including Balaam's design, the two-sequence dual design, and two four-period designs (with two and four sequences), are considered. The relative merits of these designs as compared to the standard two-sequence, two-period design are discussed. Two examples concerning bioequivalence are used to illustrate the use of these methods.","inCitations":["00c73724bb8e0b0aadf4321dd3ec4087936c9b4a","4610a12a40f29ef9d4c404c3b3ff792dbcbb52de","d12d980ab30453ce19910cd69d743ea9592f3ca8","af6f1841cfef3a818f7d99f3370ef68300533470","dbfb463841038e16b11e89f0d965ac63773a9f1d","4653b798d7666be539fab41c0a21f7e6aa807b08","b75ec9e3f685c6a53c2342fc647c02acbc7a19b0","581f7b5ceff5fa982df7ae16605ceafc66d53fa0"],"title":"On assessment of bioequivalence under a higher-order crossover design.","doi":"10.1080/10543409208835042"}

In this article, we derived a DR estimator of the generalized impact fraction (IF) with a polytomous exposure. The IF is a measure that generalizes the AF by allowing the possibility of incomplete removal of the exposure. We demonstrated the performance of the proposed estimator via a simulation study and by application to data from a large prospective cohort study conducted in Japan.","inCitations":["7a961b63f2ecfb24c81883174d229a158a46d110","0b3cca04288efdaa16d1667e8ab4e873df77e8d1","b13ca22164620729ade497a756b248ab1678ec85","08e70222e88cf4fa6f42dfacd8526075676a4d55","de2ed2618719485f022ce62c4ac890bc394a8225","80bc6790f921b011b58816084977ed0b552d3528","47cf1c451675d011b784613898a385e4bbd11edc","647530fc284efd4f2c8240ec211eb07310f09d69","ecdc763293b768a45497934954c6ce6007e6ad24","2316504bd1bfa8812abe2f0b31c6bdc0d6aa40ed","3df9c88dc169374281f492e29a9377a01afe8238","f9377450f07844a55062337b3d431c7fd1065f39"],"title":"Doubly robust estimation of the generalized impact fraction.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr038"}

The distribution of the subject-specific cumulative hazard function can be approximated with a zero-mean Gaussian process, which can be generated through simulation methods. We propose two different simulation schemes to obtain the distribution of the supremum of the cumulative hazard process over the entire time range. The two simulation approaches are asymptotically equivalent, whereas the numerical forms are different. We construct two types of confidence bands, namely the equal precision band and the Hall-Wellner type band, through choosing suitable weight functions. Monte Carlo simulation studies show that both of the proposed confidence bands are appropriate for finite sample sizes. We illustrate the new proposal with a real example.","inCitations":["6b37dbe5205ad5717110a2e8b3be3b88232626bc","7ad85fec77857c5d8b9314a250924998045be3fc","7883949acf59bb74444a87b37ecc0cf3bcf338ed","c7575322a410319526d10c2979254843863958aa","edb3d0649fd2e66ff76ce295579fc579fae5d602","90ce9e750031a1a23acbb0da3254798f5d13cc93","f92aac1ad2dbd0e15d637698162bb11808b7a204","8ef09dcb147c1858810508ae42c8d74bde1aa8e8"],"title":"Two simulation methods for constructing confidence bands under the additive risk model.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120037188"}

In this paper we describe an integrated educational web-based framework for: interactive distribution modeling, virtual online probability experimentation, statistical data analysis, visualization and integration. Following years of experience in statistical teaching at all college levels using established licensed statistical software packages, like STATA, S-PLUS, R, SPSS, SAS, Systat, etc., we have attempted to engineer a new statistics education environment, the Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR). This resource performs many of the standard types of statistical analysis, much like other classical tools. In addition, it is designed in a plug-in object-oriented architecture and is completely platform independent, web-based, interactive, extensible and secure. Over the past 4 years we have tested, fine-tuned and reanalyzed the SOCR framework in many of our undergraduate and graduate probability and statistics courses and have evidence that SOCR resources build student's intuition and enhance their learning.","inCitations":["6a4370063858b87a4ebee1028fb82822be6aae62","4ae52be514887c26cfb4fe057ba44da013330f9a","5daa6e7395caecadf1e6a106dadcff1194ecb8e2","9361d559fae39bbe25be21341cd34b5c20607fc7","3465412bd94c0156bcffcd6a6579569999c160d2","38f422c22d6af3848629975eef9f94899a178353","40f955962f74044e63617604ac16f7ae40d29df2","12ee8d9f7e71ca2bc95366c408679c52953b2132","07d7ec93619bb9ed8becdae3b8ef304635ffef79","7f94fb5f15cc21eba9892fb750b11eb163b7daf0","e47096bd14ea611de2c96d7006db425bd51e3cd4","be82c3efd5b10d2b921dba9d9f406e1ecfd57356","6c5a055a5dc414c88bcf20f928be0c464f3efc63","906ad1c5828adf93773c6106cdf1f94d55c30b26","862adbb648b108b42cc982ad21e1edaf202c0c6f","0fc35dc6493e1d25418d4a875a37fccff121c018","9fd5e7dd064c0dcb7d18f6240fb1ceca9a69bf03","1933a32697c1469028367d9bcfaa22aacd399099","88d6a536018c5fac614b04af0ea447c78369549d","c0a298eb15ed5943d0bd515a6db9e956a29b04f0","4d77793082768194758e7daebeebcf5c9b164c3f","f855e0324b1322cb84a4a433e6a6041e43e3842a","0a93ef77826810a1112e053ceb67f4b55fb4a819","6da9c5117aff7af8e209bf69a06a74bf7c1c0d50","42f3b33cd482597c9da8b4ce0f7fc11ee1389205","eb3ea1d29f9b292a50fb55714f329ce677b2eed9","eed13776029093fee7d9f63472fbadd02b9041a1"],"title":"SOCR: Statistics Online Computational Resource.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v016.i11"}

The standard log-rank test is not applicable here because the population membership information is not available for the right censored individuals. We propose to use the imputed population marks for the censored observations leading to fractional at-risk sets that can be used in a two sample censored data log-rank test. We demonstrate with a simple example that there could be a gain in power by imputing population marks (the proposed method) for the right censored individuals compared to simply removing them (which also would maintain the right size). Performance of the imputed log-rank tests obtained this way is studied through simulation. We also obtain an asymptotic linear representation of our test statistic. Our testing methodology is illustrated using a real data set.","inCitations":["16537c35683df3cce1532b75a4854035849a28c7"],"title":"Testing Equality of Survival Distributions when the Population Marks are Missing.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2007.06.028"}

Whether the goal is to estimate the prevalence of the trait or to identify those individuals that possess it, group testing can provide substantial benefits when compared to testing subjects individually. Recently, group-testing regression models have been proposed as a way to incorporate covariates when estimating trait prevalence. In this paper, we examine these models by comparing fits obtained from individual and group testing samples. Relative bias and efficiency measures are used to assess the accuracy and precision of the resulting estimates using different grouping strategies. We also investigate the agreement of individual and group-testing regression estimates for various grouping strategies and the effects of group size selection. Depending on how groups are formed, our results show that group-testing regression models can perform very well when compared to the analogous models based on individual observations. However, different grouping strategies can provide very different results in finite samples.","inCitations":["dbcd4f480d79b09b831888e4d1abd0f1511a7356","897a34cb6247ec919a060caac952acf9a29c601f","972802b4bca1520fcc794bc3c2c0c6e459f3c98d","4961d81db9e069240bb92d024af6a95358cc34cf","e4dbc0ed35b80144e50920e8cb8ef02aa0158a38","a96d7aab54c633aabbcf7265b5503af90b07ecee","b47ca9623e911dce9e8bc7aeac2142f06a263523","0ca265819955e8aa75d3f65515d82fdba0593acf","48f43f36ab2afb92836e08ebb91d487bbe07ef08","e8e6ef6c6551822b868d5428b86778dceaab1a0d","4f7fe19de1b8a62489c159135383e8cdad1ef9d9","b9523d4ba6411185b094a3f14269dd0651b95950","d4e9d1f0f400deb4e93b395eb52d6ffaa1e50d8a","a2c741830ccb44b81dafabf4fac231203d1806d0","5a746d63febda29e9f50dec6244b810eda095805","bbc770feedf469b47f50b56f4d523b57fe68a8f8","623d17ced9b641a93db285e8b690aa64dd1713dc","f9e659ac20c519466c9f14dfa7256e342b137e92","a436739a4c8fb4893471bb4a5d888528b8ee467d","52ed6385a469d0b172ca5909a56f0c7b193614e7","d3bfd4fdfa233e64ec6f527ecdf1468fb687eaac","063c8ad14e2244795300f4db7b3da2111aa962a7","c0bbca5b22ab3e6fdb20e3f29c0aae2cc9d54bd7"],"title":"Bias, efficiency, and agreement for group-testing regression models.","doi":"10.1080/00949650701608990"}

A multivariate mixed-effects model is used to describe longitudinal changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA), a free testosterone index (FTI), and body mass index (BMI) before any clinical evidence of prostate cancer. The patterns of change in these three variables are allowed to vary depending on whether the subject develops prostate cancer or not and the severity of the prostate cancer at diagnosis. An application of Bayes' theorem provides posterior probabilities that we use to predict whether an individual will develop prostate cancer and, if so, whether it is a high-risk or a low-risk cancer. The classification rule is applied sequentially one multivariate observation at a time until the subject is classified as a cancer case or until the last observation has been used. We perform the analyses using each of the three variables individually, combined together in pairs, and all three variables together in one analysis. We compare the classification results among the various analyses and a simulation study demonstrates how the sensitivity of prediction changes with respect to the number and type of variables used in the prediction process.","inCitations":["7aad3cc07f36bb8e9cba99a22043a3183ea47b06","50ebbca8f1683ecebedf41baaa7ecfa796855a32","45bfec33e8f53163361a1c5ad657bd0f27437615","480bacc5701fbdf893be20959833f1edebf78817","2751705a6458031dbd5a9ede7316dfc347d011ee","8500a1d151461cf4228fc0b8f32a89dc8853c5f4","2af4ebe7cfd335157978c99be7369900607cec7e","eca098c7973890c5f8842cf3bccbf33657f28c12","ae840efe3caafb41a8a6167fed360dff570bb593"],"title":"Screening for prostate cancer using multivariate mixed-effects models.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2011.644523"}

We show that our estimate is asymptotically equivalent to the empirical ROC curve if the underlying densities are in fact log-concave. In addition, we empirically show that our proposed estimator exhibits an efficiency gain for finite sample sizes with respect to the standard empirical estimate in various scenarios and that it is only slightly less efficient, if at all, compared to the fully parametric binormal estimate in case the underlying distributions are normal. The estimator is also quite robust against modest deviations from the log-concavity assumption. We show that bootstrap confidence intervals for the value of the ROC curve at a fixed false positive fraction based on the new estimate are on average shorter compared to the approach by Zhou and Qin (2005), while maintaining coverage probability. Computation of our proposed estimate uses the R package logcondens that implements univariate log-concave density estimation and can be done very efficiently using only one line of code. These obtained results lead us to advocate our estimate for a wide range of scenarios.","inCitations":["777919cca6df21748842b6c7feb0f4716c24597b","8e3860b566d8fcc0ba08803e879cb60a2d289a20","a52d99a98d3f4b4ad86533345e705169c5bc1cc4","a685979a73562b9aec9b7ec7fb486665a4ed71ef","b40daa1f8ba166146e0c1fe7ac0ce6608e33617f"],"title":"A Smooth ROC Curve Estimator Based on Log-Concave Density Estimates","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1378"}

Yet, finding the right amount of regularization can be challenging, especially in an unsupervised setting where traditional methods such as BIC or cross-validation often do not work well. In this paper, we propose a new method - Bootstrap Inference for Network COnstruction (BINCO) - to infer networks by directly controlling the false discovery rates (FDRs) of the selected edges. This method fits a mixture model for the distribution of edge selection frequencies to estimate the FDRs, where the selection frequencies are calculated via model aggregation. This method is applicable to a wide range of applications beyond network construction. When we applied our proposed method to building a gene regulatory network with microarray expression breast cancer data, we were able to identify high-confidence edges and well-connected hub genes that could potentially play important roles in understanding the underlying biological processes of breast cancer.","inCitations":["51a25685a41a0fe887e79295e5d016ba4f7f04ee","4a813d7f2fb81c692edd8e5a0b1fd4b90462fa2a","b21a0969e496c03e8bc6bdce04c0261e69fb964d","a78b344255588b1c7ef5de835aa6df0979aca92f","ab2afbe0e13dd7458784b6afa764b11408864192","61a207da55c2d881ea5c4de9dc86304542d66fd6","8963209b68bc27ebe9f0be41e5ecf7659b46aa42","8311e74a2dc7ba0ff85c60898840309989ccc708","02072741fcd51fcab219349ca241c6bc877e1d94","8ac362539c327a436387eb97e076448a11a1b208","148d6113ce2de6410a0caa0ee6e00a6affda59fc","83e84c20fe44d4ed62dc34d420edf7bcc4a102cc","c0af985eb8b920deb434f56b96eee02b62719df7","b91dfbdda0bec4e0b2d528e35ed5267af334e6b2","c950f8dee2d4425c4c4cfceb70fbee1a1247c99d","8ad0766a86582cdcadf32257353b5f2d848cfd96","8dc638446089c20844268cde63a855e01eb451b0","65742fc373f2c37cef4ea5fbb6a98da42d0ad082","c1a1ba86a0fb46e23438f5e2453831bc504d6423","3676202b4ded47a1438858d39d2758eeb33be140","79de4c36042bd0c604f4029531ccbe771321bc0a","eb77d9a0dd61046ae45e28bcecb6668401f43653","8789d94c5ee02acf56e91981f91a48e2eb061a41"],"title":"Bootstrap Inference for Network Construction with an Application to a Breast Cancer Microarray Study.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS589"}

Examples include time to recurrence and stage (local vs. metastatic). We study a simple model that provides insights into the relationship between the observed marked endpoint and the latent disease natural history leading to it. A semiparametric regression model is developed to assess the covariate effects on the observed marked endpoint explained by a latent disease process. The proposed semiparametric regression model can be represented as a transformation model in terms of mark-specific hazards, induced by a process-based mixed effect. Large-sample properties of the proposed estimators are established. The methodology is illustrated by Monte Carlo simulation studies, and an application to a randomized clinical trial of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.","inCitations":["de0ea6897c775e4bdb3f906b89a7d9ba5ec1b128","ba5428fda239c7df0ae5561f024aa8c6ccc53d57","b56eedcb578f2a19e8507edbf428e8c5f3c8128d","4feed0700e6d55d40122b97e03b018d30f8bda78","4df7143fb12a29c4c47303c81ee1b13afe70e44a"],"title":"Semiparametric regression analysis for time-to-event marked endpoints in cancer studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt056"}

The reason for using BOCF is not clear to many users who either treat BOCF as an imputation method or consider BOCF to be \"conservative\" in the sense that it allows treatment effect to be evaluated with a severe penalty for dropouts. In this article we address the following questions and issues: What is the reason for using BOCF? Is BOCF a conservative approach to assessing drug efficacy? Is BOCF reasonable? If not, what are the alternatives? Our discussions are based on both theoretical and practical viewpoints.","inCitations":["85bcf98f8b8a9fa1b280f4ae7e83c2d33b51c38f","00a849b882e1f1be050b89457b65ccd8233ab58c","8d35e3639c0ae6499264facc739d07340c8902da","33a37354f07b94e135677765b10a634d4f9fe3f7","4df1998c7c395149a0ab7cf2e2877f952d0973ae","3de7fecfa11caa447d76580beb08c8a192300503","c80f7eb172efb2f2837ee187c9307662ab9a42ee","fe55e11f4bbe04848f9cbc530a69505e780f6cd0","ab999f4a8b2f4bf6a42b917c45542b6de2852ad4","a053193948808ded16ec2affa53e3a515c295901","899e5166afe0f1483d8af3851acf7287eb470c99","680b363edf81917ac8c9498ba6f7520d4eb2ecfd","54af2e8e22fa4c9eea78e611ea883063e7c248bd","d957f0fc850e5329eecb69f7f33e75e0d5504cce","7244773fd203b88d3501774d5ae3ffafc3cdbe1f","8e1d204e6f96c14b60dc5e6bb741b71d14d20180","cb24ddae0d6127a80ac4db0f63760b6a9000424c","c5636c48f78db0e0ab10e6bdd45140643874aff6"],"title":"Baseline observation carry forward: reasoning, properties, and practical issues.","doi":"10.1080/10543400902964118"}

This creates an analytical challenge, however, due to the large numbers of potentially informative markers, the high degrees of correlation among them, and the time-dependent trajectories of association. We propose a mixed ridge estimator, which integrates ridge regression into the mixed effects modeling framework in order to account for both the correlation induced by repeatedly measuring an outcome on each individual over time, as well as the potentially high degree of correlation among possible predictor variables. An expectation-maximization algorithm is described to account for unknown variance and covariance parameters. Model performance is demonstrated through a simulation study and an application of the mixed ridge approach to data arising from a study of cardiometabolic biomarker responses to evoked inflammation induced by experimental low-dose endotoxemia.","inCitations":["5d2cfeb591cdc74b47df8b853e1f6d3644c86937","90ce533b91a8104b6f0fdc06fc82efe284254ded","1ce623721d17a6d9c325bd520eace323f8a91458","1b098fabfce4bbf3319dfa39a15fa34325be97e7","f08a9aadc977dc5ca1d9e9652c59f4be3a8396f5","6045ea77ba3fde028f3bc7a33643ba63417bfb24","01ffa36e7cc89206134a34a4609c73089063d168","3723a65095dc1514f0aac7370d46b5d41b6fa137"],"title":"Ridge Regression for Longitudinal Biomarker Data","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1353"}

Standard survival analysis techniques are ill-suited to this type of censoring. The familiar normal equations for the least-squares estimation are modified in several ways to properly account for the incompleteness of the data. The resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal with easily estimated variance-covariance matrices. The proposed methodology can be used when the cost database contains only the total costs for those with complete follow-up. More efficient estimators are available when the cost data are recorded in multiple time intervals. A study on the medical cost for ovarian cancer is presented.","inCitations":["a97615c259b07b3c2a1acc2ff61e18075321744d","3a6e4428b55b31f930cd20bb57224991357994d9","977b5ec7bea401e4b939afd83f0f8047f1d941a0","a75769aefceaf34fc0e41558a75dbb4967676b50","094d0660f1e6d19db52f650f577f21d6bb2e92be","0bdd55d3509f1466e2bb85f7a9e3752a219ecd33","f049d0f9a7430d5bbd1802bfccfef80932cfb9eb","0cfd56daed874c0d584ac5f732b42029d99c7b82","556bde24f3930afc800bf8f7a3225758b84805a3","1483b5c897ff4d273542fecca6aa9fbb994e1585","c6a0f20f44dfcfb136854d04d8fee94a7e562e8b","7d6360d70c621b9a8095d99d2074eceaf1d3839f","dfa295ff4693b0809aa1b31818f333f3b7f58356","ec503f55f28bd5992f4d533b5d0c02ad0c30e40e","12ab0d1673228b47bf05bd203fe735e3ef7b757d","d3c9380be1865256ec70ad838c4192df61b91c00","aa3d5414099dd4ab73c368ef683c2b5aeb4c8796","0b886a668ac85c892e516706fd6c38063cee910c","379e255e18a7af2d08e33084213d20e7aa6ebf3d","26ec1a62625d0a42e61cfae0c2b74542111a815d","2ee6ef5f5b2c01bdbc7bd5774be606d602f548b9","39cf84023f201c4422453ffe84ba507aefe4466a","9c0250a7e0d78e737c9d713073eeb7ad9057fd8b","9d04ac262466777d422fd5b9f0ecda101944483d","b018701759facd7292717d38a8429dcf0120fde4","a23b07a4b1ea646925d5f613bf9a19f5e7a40384","839ced4c3915483090d3f36d78f6986202abf954","97930775547f1f7789ba7f32b7daa8d905ea88b6","dfe385abc3508ba20dbabf1d0ab186f7d9e012a5","137438e05830b83d5670f454536e1b5800bf6fea","d21d3fc8afe35eee773f56b37af6447a5baa307b","e8da4813e7d148c23f0d51ac692f453b1c0c7c06","703309d82b26a1302c51a209b771d1c94c43d945","1bd0070bde7a96140e13cba9e23d7f3f69e3513a","500a97c00a697a20bf8ffeeca46ad09ba88607d8","1f253e8188567035d533e0b56befb18204ff07b7","132d8373a2a9939f6cec603fffbb8976f1667ea1","23108ecdc11839363eb914471ef2122f3a0b3dbd","22575c29318edcf3198c9720a8f791c3da92d089","3e6ba74332229ac168926d1d62f84de7437c721c","9aeac0e22681c3bfcc81b0fc07cbebae2e110214","11c8ce04b05af1e2d579495211f580beadbbf516","862d6dec723b556b63bb971b541250a958b66996","9c2b1399b1a480856c8c440c04c6f50ee25aee02","35665465e50a36362510cd0f79df977188d6b5ac","dd91d14f786a3ae8ac063b9aac181f3457b0c542","497ab62b171ed22af4cdd73d3168f34c723421dc","9895b8cc294d6ca756a40d455ef13c767671846b","988eeddd8a0cadab099fd0a132363b90f644b0cc","1c7b5f2d0f254ea1bdb61d1a90fb02ea4b516788","3c248358add21a1d733ce4c314149fcfaca03272","966b593c4db4523da048d42dd1020f232d854f60","e509348ed35b09ff97fb08e5f7a766d11cebf19d","c99f57f5583d972efe05346ed20bb11c326e23c4","9195238f9b0ce7057127d2ae74496be061060306","ffec04137851fb5b7733502a46d4663237999bcf","5489da037cd2f846c7ee525d2433fd819157eb47","5afa7378221003b2b792159fefbd2db4342a9e45","b04de92a58ddb45b9c4f674f64c4468ece682a7a","1e250fe2ea9966b836a495e16d349e39882af739","25ea4fd2619756e37c4374bf71a99ef610bbb079","e18560ad8378c921bb85bbac10fedcdf6a7693dd","b65aaf15946c35ed5cfa18bd62f451e097d6fd2e","4bb8d976dc099fb6d4bd874f73790bc983d44e43","8261c98f7c99a62bb2460f32ec362821fe4a097b","2cd93f76f89f0972c50303883cfd112c3674d16e","9187e8943550c1a027ac409cc696267c51d7c56c","4eef17f00719a1a808fbd5eb0759cfd3a6c3d69e","e590f463cde1e2e6993dce7791a09998ca4fe787","ae4bcd274b16db623c5609c4c8bb8f5027890296","513612164db35105937748a333bbdb9a6dfd9b08","3e3dfb0b2465ebaef65ff0488612f8910aa24146","ccee711f3b7140a340041c121d048b7783fd6086","5db722b8a43eeaf89fec2ff88dc5cd958d9c9407","88546958daa5e298a19a106f66fc70ccf7aac9b3","c9cc7f4e381294379173152813108da94a6af0c1","7effa3f284629d14b18033a870fb46565e22b34b","024f5d3f1e1c14e212d2cdae02da53080d28d45f","310d51f82afdebb005d66f3e56e412d7f080f8c9","df2de31b0559943eaa772d6b9cfeaa879c658439","633c3a9eed7afa35cf36b733d6fb201429fa2e34","a8dbef12d2ca0720aff27c24f777571566ac044d","0af587e8d4a6d617f0d689264e5da2972d8412ee","07f80d4386aa571eced9b07720d8f6f0126505d3","054baa48a1f6c119c92f575b549e7a0fc80c6a7a","66e94543c04ad955311aca6b766d57db25e658bd","8d57aa4ef5c7e65c07b858918c6c11289ead2a7d","3116efd73128391a65cd4d3591121f5629f88fc3","09b62e79ba2700b5b6381323c4544b391e206459","4123099a2310cd6ab0b0763b9103cf742d0e6d33","716b9ab0bb9b94661c71cf6492d84b21cfe8c18e","6eabbb88481f1c998407b339d9c0badfa68ecaf9","f9359495580b62d573af9bee7df99bf31fc97533","ce4a1682ec70db58ba9209644ecce4eb14e9d0ba","5fa0b046ada3cc1226be7144d2ef1eabedb2fa48","55ddf8d8ba99960405c9d6a313f7fdad629e5e98","15b35c8d4e291bedcdf5173aaed3ba3a305f87af","82aa6087893cc71a48bb83fc48d8ac6723ee8571","4e7b0f6b330bb9c65c7bfcff2564ba5d17edb5bf","5de7388c2207d1e50de52310fae69070ad6797b7","44b905d827cfec98157ee408bd5eb08f4b8897df","77fb234df08b2c643a056ddc3b527d8f31509b1c","b9cee2f38132b08db6f1f3d33fe62248c115cb1e","d9d22c6c3afe406e39dd0dde31ae8d7e5b15a9a8","4f9cb4825eecce86dbc7826f17cc12d640a16d75","81b7489cb250bde4105f02d8ba67fcf38c19da6d","b571b061327cca1e6d4699e9e551d00c3df9e127","90a0e1d4831fc850e8379e758072066acb50b8c3","3df79902395a50e7142c371dcbaf9dc51144c0da","841e19e1d0248bd2adb37b555e58efaf57d46038"],"title":"Linear regression analysis of censored medical costs.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.1.35"}

Inference methods for such panel data have been developed for time homogeneous Markov models, but there has been little research done for other classes of processes. We develop likelihood-based methods for panel data from a semi-Markov process, where transition intensities depend on the duration of time in the current state. The proposed methods account for possible misclassification of states. To illustrate the methods, we investigate a three- and a four-state models in detail and apply the results to model the natural history of oncogenic genital human papillomavirus infections in women.","inCitations":["25b728f38a25c1850667f494208dec0e8f265e23","ae7a95693665db7ea14c5fd1dd7c4b83f172dda1","977f5ed1de5f69de182c9b21e3de826a42a9ee18","05ff835551a4c54f17d4ed4cbb0fdab8c0cca703","13a2f4a0545f0b94da2ec80f869f5cbda5cffe08","ee0d8b0504b26a51845bb248f0005c383d3cc0b8","439cb81323da7239cb793aac079b935a82518bc7","1ea6c1f511451d2e3249ecde8d0f4fa55e7d3103","70b3b3780161c36bb4cc573cf95c24b5b523e4f6","5256c264d42f4e3cbecc0975c9b7b5f0cde0618e","b3bd6dd1bb1969872f39617549d0ffedab303c59","c99b823138a32720313d16323968a17f32172a03","21e0e2536e85da8bdbe3d7ec3ca4b8c0d2255204","a58d1b244d862ff9ae12deca05be08cbf086a0bd","9b381b739bfc5d6317b202694b5989335df93177","f54e8ababafdcc6ac68a21a14bfb5847d0e13ee2","37557c0e264d50227ef5fa2f8c4eac53f7b1d61a","c847ebae2cb7a8b8e9e1340a3aaf82fd6f486356","46e354342a08b604a7a193bb55d054436c4bcb6a","d539d0fb7d1e485720171634c34efb367f0c9ba0","26ac1a9097af80afe6504e62aa401deb31151592","ec3f6c181148f0b3c8e05e627fc4b1e728656db4","428326e6d546a3e83c2922394451a34c1cfa4764","23741ca91ccf84b7e789f0493c7b74a285b5948b","111b1fa130d2e7045784120d32028788a05f3786","f7496f1749bbdc73e11bb3e4e3f0d4de26e6d5fa","575fd7d82f4b425bda06d587efa4f2cb3875afb8","89331fce68d13742744a95ebcacdfc269f24e79b","a0f0fbe522e646f6136b3d31b2ab689f9513e2a2","10e6b89a7129b7efd82da8caefdd9adb020e16a0","403b81cd65084f71baeaf1f2e2af3a15b495e844","1650570aad00c0187938e1b2a132e1df89de81ff","f3f6834bd37aad77fe554e238d21b9437500116c","d92b5af650199b3706af67baf5bfd1d10612d561","ed7f6d0639230acf0ef8f485b7bc87daa2c77d03","bf60f4ba227f9dc6b02ce16390b5bbaa38309d51"],"title":"Statistical methods for panel data from a semi-Markov process, with application to HPV.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl006"}

Further, studies in the health sciences often give rise to correlated, possibly censored, survival data. With no missing covariate data, if the marginal distributions of the correlated survival times follow a given parametric model, then the estimates using the maximum likelihood estimating equations, naively treating the correlated survival times as independent, give consistent estimates of the relative risk parameters Lipsitz et al. 1994 50, 842-846. Now, suppose that some observations within a cluster have some missing covariates. We show in this paper that if one naively treats observations within a cluster as independent, that one can still use the maximum likelihood estimating equations to obtain consistent estimates of the relative risk parameters. This method requires the estimation of the parameters of the distribution of the covariates. We present results from a clinical trial Lipsitz and Ibrahim (1996b) 2, 5-14 with five covariates, four of which have some missing values. In the trial, the clusters are the hospitals in which the patients were treated.","inCitations":["28b40d46549d9f267b90a6afc34eb5faf5441f68","babcf4efa66b272be3cbe57edd0a3731b8b16611","d7c795ec2d5ddf30362116044809864eed9a1169","171b6614629a58c256a89dfd28114fdb7f16c55e","c6439fb2390d5803d54f7a9e7c27dd1c11abeb23","3ad624704002fdc201b3ddd374a5938526d75d8a","11223ffbe0e4a83929f2224f7ec35aea4dd5c788","b09f41e4e3d7d59a996cce61cc14524122517bae","c9d1d8317d87159b63617eb3dbee6b9fcdd85943"],"title":"Estimation with correlated censored survival data with missing covariates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.3.315"}

In addition, an early assessment of product stability prior to completion of each individual study is desired. However, predictive measures of individual lots may produce early indication of failure. In many cases, these prove to be false alarms. For such products, continued product quality after marketing should, therefore, depend less on evaluating individual observations or individual lot projections, and more on assuring that the underlying stability profile of the product as a whole has not changed. We propose a monitoring procedure and an index of the average quality of vaccine lots currently on the market. We explore the statistical properties of the index for several experimental designs for sampling of marketed lots, and we describe an optimality property of the index.","inCitations":["f6a8719686e08cfffcd79a39a0538e0ad2fb40a7","dd6e621428ab63b00cd2264be5a526ed6f75e80a","3b289b18e147cc50744a6f51d0f9f2b6160b17a5"],"title":"Monitoring the stability of human vaccines.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120022762"}
