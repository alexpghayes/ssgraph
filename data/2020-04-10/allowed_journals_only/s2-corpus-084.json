When the sample size is large, it is a common practice to rely upon a Normal distribution approximation to construct these intervals. However, we demonstrate that the sample mean of highly dispersed Negative Binomials exhibits a slow convergence in distribution to the Normal as a function of the sample size. As a result, standard techniques (such as the Normal approximation and bootstrap) will construct confidence intervals for the mean that are typically too narrow and significantly undercover at small sample sizes or high dispersions. To address this problem, we propose techniques based upon Bernstein's inequality or the Gamma and Chi Square distributions as alternatives to the standard methods. We investigate the impact of imposing a heuristic assumption of boundedness on the data as a means of improving the Bernstein method. Furthermore, we propose a ratio statistic relating the Negative Binomial's parameters that can be used to ascertain the applicability of the Chi Square method and to provide guidelines on evaluating the length of all proposed methods. We compare the proposed methods to the standard techniques in a variety of simulation experiments and consider data arising in the serial analysis of gene expression and traffic flow in a communications network.","inCitations":["f42f3a9e08f6216b9383a56c156ff363ee19d3b6","b67662134f0133ab61d89150561e2235c5ed15b9","1cb520a544bb09b4060ae851dbf42ed4c1a10d3e","e32e67f5e1caa8049723e7d12171109826fa29ac","59bcf47f1de7b684a20bb69b4e9dadfb8d6ee235","3f98b99d6ecfc644e32caf84d8878ae9096a7de8","84a2eb4c4cc59bca81d2d851eca3814abd476d8d","64f8218c9e77e06780c8843d6e19767249823d98","5882d21a92e13e9406e70df0b75904a4f15b9a67","9162cad6d96104dd290ac92c94209521baf98bd7","e995a26fa47fa2262fad40ca7ee10651938646e9","556387798b61afc9fbe286be1f3bf57e777e1e6f"],"title":"Confidence Intervals for Negative Binomial Random Variables of High Dispersion","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1164"}

However, there is a lack of statistical metrics to evaluate prognostic utility of biomarkers in this context due to the challenges associated with unknown cure status and heavy censorship. In this article, we develop general concordance measures as evaluation metrics for the discriminatory accuracy of transformation cure models including the so-called promotion time cure models and mixture cure models. We introduce explicit formulas for the consistent estimates of the concordance measures, and show that their asymptotically normal distributions do not depend on the unknown censoring distribution. The estimates work for both parametric and semiparametric transformation models as well as transformation cure models. Numerical feasibility of the estimates and their robustness to the censoring distributions are illustrated via simulation studies and demonstrated using a melanoma data set.","inCitations":["e52f17cffd6e502146b7f415d251af4f02bb636c","8433fd5ee37b9e7665130b512df5e10ccf2fc36f"],"title":"Concordance measure and discriminatory accuracy in transformation cure models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx016"}

We consider situations where groups of variables are also of interest. For example, each variable might be a genetic polymorphism, and we might want to study how a trait depends on variability in genes, segments of DNA that typically contain multiple such polymorphisms. In this context, to discover that a variable is relevant for the outcome implies discovering that the larger entity it represents is also important. To guarantee meaningful results with high chance of replicability, we suggest controlling the rate of false discoveries for findings at the level of individual variables and at the level of groups. Building on the knockoff construction of Barber and Candès [Ann. Statist. 43 (2015) 2055-2085] and the multilayer testing framework of Barber and Ramdas [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser.

We prove that MKF simultaneously controls the FDR at each resolution and use simulations to show that it incurs little power loss compared to methods that provide guarantees only for the discoveries of individual variables. We apply MKF to analyze a genetic dataset and find that it successfully reduces the number of false gene discoveries without a significant reduction in power.","inCitations":["04b3f0108b0edbcd4905f57a8a813ffdd2e9b4ba","a3aae676ecf4dc82d3e84525ebc8aae226ce6992","51a136885660243648355f8372598027ccefd1c5","6bba817804b350037fcee15dd4d5c2f31b7d6c1d","6f7421d24b2017d7e1242f74b9a5109fe90b9d8c","afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf","24f8a55cf794d6a0d1c4a90720eff705d5eb3548","7e504bfb29d24a97e374b90c0f9ce4bdf1bcc68b","ed6606260eb60c87edf1044c3e1c2b06c0afd5d4","30875fc5e6a4972d16936d5235e84966d8cf3a81","deed3db4ac71a6dc1cf6f5d965e8c5d0e88f64f4","a9457a06fb1838e9c250ed2b5b7adcc37f57264c","28b29ba8db35f001b33240676e3093f8cc73c27f","2396ec6250ca41bc88b9fd3b47ef1a5faa917b59"],"title":"Multilayer Knockoff Filter: Controlled Variable Selection at Multiple Resolutions.","doi":"10.1214/18-AOAS1185"}

These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the stable unit treatment value assumption, the strong ignorability of treatment assignment assumption, and the assumption that propensity scores be bounded away from zero and one (the positivity assumption). Of these assumptions, the first two have received much attention in the literature. Yet the positivity assumption has been recently discussed in only a few papers. Propensity scores of zero or one are indicative of deterministic exposure so that causal effects cannot be defined for these subjects. Therefore, these subjects need to be removed because no comparable comparison groups can be found for such subjects. In this paper, using currently available causal inference methods, we evaluate the effect of arbitrary cutoffs in the distribution of propensity scores and the impact of those decisions on bias and efficiency. We propose a tree-based method that performs well in terms of bias reduction when the definition of positivity is based on a single confounder. This tree-based method can be easily implemented using the statistical software program, R. R code for the studies is available online.","inCitations":["5190fdd5cd9163316084838cbcd8916facb617b3"],"title":"Practice of causal inference with the propensity of being zero or one: assessing the effect of arbitrary cutoffs of propensity scores.","doi":"10.5351/CSAM.2016.23.1.001"}

For approval, at least one hypothesis must be rejected in both studies. Various weights are considered for the fallback and weighted Holm procedure to provide separation in a single study. Evaluation of the procedures as closed tests distinguishes which has the highest power in different situations. No procedure is universally optimal. The best procedure depends on the power to reject the various hypotheses, something that is never known with certainty, and the goals of the analyses. If the most important goal is to demonstrate a difference on the first hypothesis or on all hypotheses, the fixed-sequence procedure performs best. However, the fixed sequence often has the highest chance of obtaining inconsistent results between the two independent studies, which makes it less appealing. The weighted Holm and fallback procedures are very similar, with various weighting schemes providing modest differentiation. The alpha exhaustive version of the fallback procedure often has higher power for some endpoints and lower power for other endpoints compared to the weighted Holm procedure, but the differences are rarely large.","inCitations":["f3da1413a7101395d71f24c02d54ba1e78b0a254","9ddc221865f1dd90ab38ab633228eb6d2703679b"],"title":"Multiple testing procedures in two pivotal clinical trials for approval of a new pharmaceutical product.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.551330"}

Tuning parameters are set by minimizing a discrepancy measure while the distribution of the calibration parameters are determined based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The proposed Bayesian model views the output as a realization of a Gaussian stochastic process with hyperpriors. Draws from the resulting posterior distribution are obtained by the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.

Current methods of fitting and inference for mixed effects models tend to perform poorly in such settings. When there are many variables, it is appealing to allow uncertainty in subset selection and to obtain a sparse characterization of the data. Bayesian methods are available to address these goals using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but MCMC is very computationally expensive and can be infeasible in large p and/or large n problems. As a fast approximate Bayes solution, we recommend a novel approximation to the posterior relying on variational methods. Variational methods are used to approximate the posterior of the parameters in a decomposition of the variance components, with priors chosen to obtain a sparse solution that allows selection of random effects. The method is evaluated through a simulation study, and applied to an epidemiological application.","inCitations":["81a2fee62bcfba6bed7896780f554e95007d47e9","4b8d6bb9eb2457ddd85b6e32c6c6f3e2fe9f6a69","25184e0a832be1752394a557a76ecfeb55849c3c","6f24d7a6e1c88828e18d16c6db20f5329f6a6827","cbcf947a06b796a772206571ebd05cd61714da0a"],"title":"Sparse Variational Analysis of Linear Mixed Models for Large Data Sets.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2011.02.029"}

Motivated by breast cancer data arising from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program, we propose a covariate-adjusted proportional hazards frailty model for the analysis of clustered right-censored data. Rather than incorporating exchangeable frailties in the linear predictor of commonly-used survival models, we allow the frailty distribution to flexibly change with both continuous and categorical cluster-level covariates and model them using a dependent Bayesian nonparametric model. The resulting process is flexible and easy to fit using an existing R package. The application of the model to our motivating example showed that, contrary to intuition, those diagnosed during a period of time in the 1990s in more rural and less affluent Iowan counties survived breast cancer better. Additional analyses showed the opposite trend for earlier time windows. We conjecture that this anomaly has to be due to increased hormone replacement therapy treatments prescribed to more urban and affluent subpopulations.","inCitations":["b038b4e73ce901a187899282d914f6eab717f96f","ce5c2d2e4be2307db89d2974727f8013bb77296d","a956f9c0ef556506f23cb8f0eba811581eee1335","d1ed9b84ea5e0e8b184607a4c4f242c679027041","2197bc37065e1b8ac0bd4bb1185109dfb08ac5f0","d9527fe4b481ad1d5979451c46ff3645783ff18d"],"title":"Modelling County Level Breast Cancer Survival Data Using a Covariate-adjusted Frailty Proportional Hazards Model.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS793"}

A compound hierarchical correlated beta mixture (CBM) with an exchangeable correlation structure is proposed to cluster genetic vectors into mixture components. The correlation coefficient, [Formula: see text], is homogenous within a mixture component and heterogeneous between mixture components. A random CBM with [Formula: see text] brings more flexibility in explaining correlation variations among genetic variables. Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and Stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm are used to estimate parameters of CBM. The number of mixture components can be determined using model selection criteria such as AIC, BIC and ICL-BIC. Extensive simulation studies were conducted to compare EM, SEM and model selection criteria. Simulation results suggest that CBM outperforms the traditional beta mixture model with lower estimation bias and higher classification accuracy. The proposed method is applied to cluster transcription factor-DNA binding probability in mouse genome data generated by Lahdesmaki and others (2008, Probabilistic inference of transcription factor binding from multiple data sources. PLoS One, 3: , e1820). The results reveal distinct clusters of transcription factors when binding to promoter regions of genes in JAK-STAT, MAPK and other two pathways.","inCitations":["217f32d8f973e2a1e364507a4ff01ceb1da89a34"],"title":"Compound hierarchical correlated beta mixture with an application to cluster mouse transcription factor DNA binding data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv016"}

We propose a simple yet principled analytic approach based on the linear mixed-effects model for interval-censored data for the analysis of such paired measurements. Having estimated the model parameters, the risk ratio can be estimated by explicit composite estimand and the variance is estimated using the delta method. The estimation can be implemented using the existing procedures in popular statistical software.

We compare the blinded sample size re-estimation method with two unblinded methods with respect to the empirical type I error, the empirical power, and the empirical distribution of the standard deviation estimator and final sample size. We characterize the type I error inflation across the range of standardized non-inferiority margin for non-inferiority trials, and derive the adjusted significance level to ensure type I error control for given sample size of the internal pilot study. We show that the adjusted significance level increases as the sample size of the internal pilot study increases.

To date, research studies that have compared various FDR/FWER methodologies have made use of limited simulation studies and/or have applied the methods to one or more microarray gene expression dataset(s). However, for microarray datasets the veracity of each null hypothesis tested is unknown so that an objective evaluation of performance cannot be rendered for application data. Due to the role of methylation in X-chromosome inactivation, we postulate that high-throughput methylation datasets may provide an appropriate forum for assessing the performance of commonly used FDR methodologies. These datasets preserve the complex correlation structure between probes, offering an advantage over simulated datasets. Using several methylation datasets, commonly used FDR methods including the q-value, Benjamini & Hochberg, and Benjamini & Yekutieli procedures as well as Holm's step down method were applied to identify CpG sites that are differentially methylated when comparing healthy males to healthy females. The methods were compared with respect to their ability to identify CpG sites located on sex chromosomes as significant, by reporting the sensitivity, specificity, and observed FDR. These datasets are useful for characterizing the performance of multiple comparison procedures, and may find further utility in other tasks such as comparing variable selection capabilities of classification methods and evaluating the performance of meta-analytic methods for microarray data.","inCitations":["c5e831f48aba75772cafb45db48d5bef49bfa6a2","71e8e17f265ee74c1f9b95c21ee7d6b5bd1a4791","e96df9458b2bd0fa25e6e6fa44194975752d4b79","2175d667fbfb171c50cd37f0fd5e34d3b6f91dea","7809664799f01b300241ac9239057a883e81670d","a0d32e76e1b394f985c139132edc4aaddf9f8dbf","3461cb8ffc7c6ed7796cb9828f71e6f5aba607f2","f626d4d1c17b35a18284ad015afb3f96d20b4fd8","b2193459844f907e321909cbbd9fe8e8ea3c7754","3d6badab86e3d430c8e61ac1b38640e691e42170"],"title":"High-throughput DNA methylation datasets for evaluating false discovery rate methodologies","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2011.10.020","year":2012}

The estimation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) curves is a function of a baseline covariate using two cytotoxic agents. A logistic model is used to describe the relationship between the doses, baseline covariate, and the probability of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Trial design proceeds by treating cohorts of two patients simultaneously using escalation with overdose control (EWOC), where at each stage of the trial, the next dose combination corresponds to the α quantile of the current posterior distribution of the MTD of one of two agents at the current dose of the other agent and the next patient's baseline covariate value. The MTD curves are estimated as function of Bayes estimates of the model parameters at the end of trial. Average DLT, pointwise average bias, and percent of dose recommendation at dose combination neighborhoods around the true MTD are compared to the design that uses the covariate to the one that ignores the baseline characteristic. We also examine the performance of the approach under model misspecifications for the true dose-toxicity relationship. The methodology is further illustrated by the case of a pre-specified discrete set of dose combinations.","inCitations":["6b478146a1b8e4fe2474d69d278fdae5564cf0ec"],"title":"A Bayesian Adaptive Design in Cancer Phase I Trials using Dose Combinations in the Presence of a Baseline Covariate.","doi":"10.1155/2018/8654173","year":2018}
