A discriminant methodology based on principal points is introduced. The principal point classification method is useful in clinical trials where the goal is to distinguish and differentiate between different treatment effects. Particularly, in psychiatric studies where placebo response rates can be very high, the principal point classification is illustrated to distinguish specific drug responders from non-specific placebo responders.","inCitations":["5bbddeb8de0e133e21e291252c4687a5fc5f0210","1d0d5ab81d9e64da38790cfeaa3cc22d64428f67","910e74a25d869febcf448bf2704626d276640463","af7f44e0f2210db9be70ff48e2a2cdf1ab9e769b"],"title":"Principal Point Classification: Applications to Differentiating Drug and Placebo Responses in Longitudinal Studies.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2009.07.030"}

Marginally the model represents a mixture of nested continuous-time Markov processes in which sub-models are defined by constraining some transition intensities to zero between two or more states of a full model. A Fisher scoring algorithm is described which facilitates maximum likelihood estimation based only on the first derivatives of the transition probability matrices. The model is fit to data from a smoking prevention study and is shown to provide a significant improvement in fit over a time-homogeneous Markov model. Extensions are developed which facilitate examination of covariate effects on both the transition intensities and the mover-stayer probabilities.","inCitations":["caa775f23816b082713743168634d6544836c1ab","977f5ed1de5f69de182c9b21e3de826a42a9ee18","32aa90202be495c8cedd353590b6502e495b8e20","c6d64013bed8d7463e9cdcc30edc0c459514053b","667d8bf8f60b0ec6adc90b3568e242a1bc581206","15f93f34c1e08e0856e77e5150abc0feb348d5e4","eaa9118fd42393665d48d782350595008ab7a4ee","2e93a3b21705583926909f14dbf3171d10db90fc","18572beb8e6e19e5e617e442a7f8e7c7c74fb06c","ea29c5fdd0c64a68a305043ebe3048fffc976cae","1b422cbfb043c715c4098f6173f8c269a1373d33","e693d0455a346f0f66ebaf621464c9833bc40a0a","c8321f5d621cac417b879491597453e37831c610","2ccaf2fce0626e2e8c82129b205bd84df8846dbd","a99527e575730204d009cefd4ba608d4d13781d9","07795258def301e03bb3e21db819181aa905b623","9f2b5841095afe3534130dae677cc386b9bb3315","da8e95d861d7cbacbc1f6a22242fe001ee470aef","17cdf616ec225888ea289594a82c3f7035ee4aa5","33375db606f7c15922b651ec5f6059e020d87006","9ee77ec2ad32b6b58a68495bf076d1b4da58b65b","6d56db39a1f3641ba6add2d3c467464a396fccb9","d8ecf017368a420c816e5f04b35b5982af1f0306","f54e8ababafdcc6ac68a21a14bfb5847d0e13ee2","3671646150f285a83bf7a62c17f137fbb4bae1f9","f4f8cfd5dc8e284b2be0970c4151fa97b304667f","f4ed149ad11ec980c9fb8fed1d94907fc19a5f0f","c7414bf89521ba30b1070bd2f2444d39f64fb7a8","1ded5ec2569ab99227c27bb74e23bb95ba1b69f3","0dfad6be6d5b180327ebc5882141282d1af4aebf","b093f951a96a031775e9c6cc56a421c240bb3e46","3356ecffa0d2b9779f2128ab16f0df43fe1a4141","881e2de0cd51722fe8bc575d0334f72507a135a1"],"title":"A generalized mover-stayer model for panel data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.3.407"}

Much of these data are quantitative image data, which are characterized by intensities that represent some measurement of interest in the scanned images. The data typically consist of multiple images on the same domain and the goal of the research is to combine the quantitative information across images to make inference about populations or interventions. In this paper, we present a unified analysis framework for the analysis of quantitative image data using a Bayesian functional mixed model approach. This framework is flexible enough to handle complex, irregular images with many local features, and can model the simultaneous effects of multiple factors on the image intensities and account for the correlation between images induced by the design. We introduce a general isomorphic modeling approach to fitting the functional mixed model, of which the wavelet-based functional mixed model is one special case. With suitable modeling choices, this approach leads to efficient calculations and can result in flexible modeling and adaptive smoothing of the salient features in the data. The proposed method has the following advantages: it can be run automatically, it produces inferential plots indicating which regions of the image are associated with each factor, it simultaneously considers the practical and statistical significance of findings, and it controls the false discovery rate. Although the method we present is general and can be applied to quantitative image data from any application, in this paper we focus on image-based proteomic data. We apply our method to an animal study investigating the effects of opiate addiction on the brain proteome. Our image-based functional mixed model approach finds results that are missed with conventional spot-based analysis approaches. In particular, we find that the significant regions of the image identified by the proposed method frequently correspond to subregions of visible spots that may represent post-translational modifications or co-migrating proteins that cannot be visually resolved from adjacent, more abundant proteins on the gel image. Thus, it is possible that this image-based approach may actually improve the realized resolution of the gel, revealing differentially expressed proteins that would not have even been detected as spots by modern spot-based analyses.","inCitations":["cb4dbdf0c95c0b186ad7aac9d86f3d35094fc432","8bf620765e77c98424983de5d5b74b90d99e28fd","62f9209a2c26a8ace46c3c17e730cb5630a65da9","03eec63d9edf842f921cc32e261d1e6ba155f1a4","81476dc1ea8402228751d26743b499c3b6eb50ae","2163c538b18e3fee559fcd782a04ba8942cb178d","5326acfa0dc381ce8849a735ae2a6138be980650","42eca75539ee8bfeb115c26f10ca5fce80910a74","db9f15b4604aee15ae14d25bc1294a58f998e872","05e58a4634b7d4d847fcecc868a3c255365fe9f9","d53f71ed9537f2f125358cda26fb0341e2e5204f","dc81342cf2c2c9d0727fe9a17d870bc56934b558","a4563e73eaafc4a1e46456599abac370101d225b","d206629e510a7137a7ad280e0c38fb3941fa7ca4","0ad2601c3b2dffce402211c5b15f9695591b5317","46a7b6bcca86844d38acaef449568c66ce91c176","83dbdd76d69b4732916219629f49576644a394c7","98e35b72dd0e3e678d774ab273533bb8fa0aa159","f6f74d14155e063dfd58314a17e0f77544befade","1a5633f2b789478375750eef672cf1769353d410","a523c2d6b487fbeab718bc2693c844af0c97dde5","a43a4e44227ceb7e7ca68bb73c21eae56112eea5","8c439f3492404fec6e4ff8bb34d11f8ec4dca2d0","bb5f2d60731ab730031eb3c2d5c2be907a66a618","61e3f1d84a0d71638545324dfc919551abe637e8","90f2d408bdc7e8bb47e8af6e70866512f03b97f0","97e70d0775a13802f48d02f4aa62c582e8f2362a","31b9aa29ea7eafc160cd4bc51334f563a1859969","5db9748197d3f2659b1add788ae8293a967ca738","0cc01cc0a61a81742b71c5dad84aafc7355547b6","34e3153c3ff614ab745de234e6c35043c5b37b47","8e47a70d21d8b3cd59a50a6fb8d25483ba5bbe5a","f74ac289347e9e754c45c96e024910d6f221d018","b3a2670dc08d3d26fb3616a78526d03d62293957","0260705e950801fe48560ce039887a81d72328d9","8791d92497782b295eea2481c059dd3a37cd79ad","451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54","10f1282ed63bcda87b8e6c422a085ad816ed3048"],"title":"Automated Analysis of Quantitative Image Data Using Isomorphic Functional Mixed Models, with Application to Proteomics Data.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS407"}

When many parameters are estimated, marginal confidence intervals associated with the most significant estimates have very low coverage rates: They are too small and centered at biased estimates. The problem of forming confidence intervals in high dimensional settings has previously been studied through the lens of selection adjustment. In that framework, the goal is to control the proportion of non-covering intervals formed for selected parameters. In this paper we approach the problem by considering the relationship between rank and coverage probability. Marginal confidence intervals have very low coverage rates for the most significant parameters and high rates for parameters with more boring estimates. Many selection adjusted intervals have the same behavior despite controlling the coverage rate within a selected set. This relationship between rank and coverage rate means that the parameters most likely to be pursued further in follow-up or replication studies are the least likely to be covered by the constructed intervals. In this paper, we propose rank conditional coverage (RCC) as a new coverage criterion for confidence intervals in multiple testing/covering problems. The RCC is the expected coverage rate of an interval given the significance ranking for the associated estimator. We also propose two methods that use bootstrapping to construct confidence intervals that control the RCC. Because these methods make use of additional information captured by the ranks of the parameter estimates, they often produce smaller intervals than marginal or selection adjusted methods. These methods are implemented in R (R Core Team, 2017) in the package rcc available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rcc/index.html.","inCitations":["1f9644a0b7accf8aff4ef32b90af49f7ee993a34"],"title":"Rank Conditional Coverage and Confidence Intervals in High-Dimensional Problems.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2017.1411270"}

The discussion is based on a specific case study, but the arguments and principles remain valid in general. The example concerns the design of a randomized clinical trial to compare a gel sealant versus standard care for resolving air leaks after pulmonary resection. The design follows a principled approach to optimal decision making, including a probability model for the unknown distributions of time to resolution of air leaks under the two treatment arms, and an explicit utility function that quantifies clinical preferences for alternative outcomes. As is typical for any real application, the final implementation includes some compromises from the initial principled setup. In particular, we use the formal decision problem only for the final decision, but use reasonable ad-hoc decision boundaries for making interim group sequential decisions that stop the trial early. Beyond the discussion of the particular study, we review more general considerations of using a decision theoretic approach for clinical trial design and summarize some of the reasons why such approaches are not commonly used.","inCitations":["1acbabb98ea1afdd656e46aaacddd75410b71529"],"title":"Clinical Trial Design as a Decision Problem.","doi":"10.1002/asmb.2222"}

The main goals of analyzing aCGH data are to identify the regions of copy number variation (CNV) and to quantify the amount of CNV. Although there are many methods for analyzing single-sample aCGH data, the analysis of multi-sample aCGH data is a relatively new area of research. Further, many of the current approaches for analyzing multi-sample aCGH data do not appropriately utilize the additional information present in the multiple samples. We propose a procedure called the Fused Lasso Latent Feature Model (FLLat) that provides a statistical framework for modeling multi-sample aCGH data and identifying regions of CNV. The procedure involves modeling each sample of aCGH data as a weighted sum of a fixed number of features. Regions of CNV are then identified through an application of the fused lasso penalty to each feature. Some simulation analyses show that FLLat outperforms single-sample methods when the simulated samples share common information. We also propose a method for estimating the false discovery rate. An analysis of an aCGH data set obtained from human breast tumors, focusing on chromosomes 8 and 17, shows that FLLat and Significance Testing of Aberrant Copy number (an alternative, existing approach) identify similar regions of CNV that are consistent with previous findings. However, through the estimated features and their corresponding weights, FLLat is further able to discern specific relationships between the samples, for example, identifying 3 distinct groups of samples based on their patterns of CNV for chromosome 17.","inCitations":["1ed70595947c16b2ae2b1ada1ac3e7a1d8eba13b","83e30cc465cca8028b1503e75686d5dcb8dad386","5d2fa7ebdb61d83ae7954bb48b7f7d44dd16b7ad","c6f70ce1818409a50bdd705538f4f1e203092799","3d1e7d593dbd7b2945d0402cce0b3b1c6a2c50ba","714f712ad52b036ef99f825cf01f7378c5a88e2c","a0781ff3336c4a41ccba40111258444b8ebd6961","3ea0da269a2ba28c5bf1303d5eb0267fb603709f","f59fcb79383f898fefb4dab6cb3b661e77f7e411","ec8252015f03f7ef7b7eaafcc352c3fa0d069a87","cc93c46290b96c272f7633d2904baf53f0b57b90","ddc6e677715c03fe574319d3f80a3e1577bdbdd3","d5faa96cf9df3acea54b1ffe478135e3f45119b4","1d6e164ac3b10948aa99b467fe29017cf0eb4ed3","c9126c47f55c2e1afe9365df550343e008477abe","c1bd61243f1dbbb0a64fd1d3bdc2411022d2a4c2","6e57d253b09f5e6fd5ae6a68949633f4be0ef2ba","eb6dda5c914887f31f8e11e236641e53d7f58c65","3047e65ecefa26f9ede6c83bd740fe952a32ce22","456bd0de0b6e88319ec42db4cd7db2a847ba6969","8b2bad4c57e3b2d6ba76d3b5193b3c393a25936a","94ab500a5e3b64b7707273c62917475a6e61e23d","0bf2fbfcd7bbc611eb8db4358bad7a870bf830b5","fdbd00990753f74f958ca244846eff9159b8a87a","427fa634338f7e7a2122706ecf6c744a4b74dd7f","8cc3a0a88b5980c95b02cfa79b4f97723cdc914b","37fcac2ace6a5adf2d364a98d35eab9c2705b2fa","86ca3143bfd64c3fac0427aba23d8b53fd9e40ab","979dd419c2bd63ad6690bc5d80a8124ed890ba13","60b50cad7562ad75bfccd25d2a6a8a7f523921a3","48288318cee36df77cb73e4807b610235525ba4e","b2212706f76fff7a7df8d485bc23b2c0bf35d358","0260a1100802f9173b24a3040c02032f42d94381","bc0396a229ebe2ebc96454f88b7d9a5343b8666d","da07c28ee46316227ab61c1cb0ebd0854181a30b","e0d14504971aaa47457d8318a4977281ca7c8a72","e977aacbe190100f8c570b02c06beddc8828ae6d","f4e528e38e84a35020907a8086401d0110492961","3baa0a3a21904602e25225181f9ae94fb7a688d1","3bbb390ab5f7bc99723fd96975b6a0447c3f46cc","0b47ffe591b396f8c00a3f888af60865e04aec68","8e1060954e126447c123ea8e7c47f6c4b250ff16","e0e8ecce55fe41906473dc295649533702424c5d","bd65725aba19465813f9a918c0eee9d869d2e508","e04cf9fd572bc1920f47c50852fb9957cd887140","5d36ee7d7a5c7d57333a5e64f0545920321486d1","3ddee37d1b161069ed352775757feea6c5a33df3","6c7043321966bbf85f6b372c3c02d6940910a9ac","a48844591888078bcddd9c11a7ac0e9d664fe8a0"],"title":"A fused lasso latent feature model for analyzing multi-sample aCGH data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr012"}

Even in randomized studies the mediator may still be correlated with unobserved prognostic variables that affect the outcome, in which case the mediator's role in the causal process may not be inferred without bias. In the behavioural and social science literature very little attention has been given so far to the causal assumptions required for moderated mediation analysis. In this paper we focus on the index for moderated mediation, which measures by how much the mediated effect is larger or smaller for varying levels of the moderator. We show that in linear models this index can be estimated without bias in the presence of unmeasured common causes of the moderator, mediator and outcome under certain conditions. Importantly, one can thus use the test for moderated mediation to support evidence for mediation under less stringent confounding conditions. We illustrate our findings with data from a randomized experiment assessing the impact of being primed with social deception upon observer responses to others' pain, and from an observational study of individuals who ended a romantic relationship assessing the effect of attachment anxiety during the relationship on mental distress 2 years after the break-up.","inCitations":["4452cc53983a567e0ee0cd5653e2c57aac46152a","4507ef56c6ecd83eb76e08d8ff14bf85c586206c"],"title":"Assessing moderated mediation in linear models requires fewer confounding assumptions than assessing mediation.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12077"}

There are large geographical variation and racial disparities existing in the survival rate of prostate cancer. Much work on the spatial survival model is based on the proportional hazards model, but few focused on the accelerated failure time model. In this paper, we investigate the prostate cancer data of Louisiana from the SEER program and the violation of the proportional hazards assumption suggests the spatial survival model based on the accelerated failure time model is more appropriate for this data set. To account for the possible extra-variation, we consider spatially-referenced independent or dependent spatial structures. The deviance information criterion (DIC) is used to select a best fitting model within the Bayesian frame work. The results from our study indicate that age, race, stage and geographical distribution are significant in evaluating prostate cancer survival.","inCitations":["df8a4ffa620bb10a0a3e13c8d68b73491e0f39ad","c5df684ff5d803c058b22b00f86a9b8e4eee41ac","b1e50b38810f3c04d703051642aab8d241d3b479","33160ccaf1d991e8f6778b9ced8d7311329a10b4","9127a215a6964b2414291f947b16538a3f1287c5","51aa859982cc7be2a42984341ad9ccafff9954bb","d9527fe4b481ad1d5979451c46ff3645783ff18d","f880f42ac6dc2bb78d6351bcf8bb9416d239930d","923515cb8f6901db2f96e20711d699312d0773d7","17d25fddd039701466c3b568fd977423e5c9b9d9","816834f912282206f460577ee138b168bac0f078","1e4966a3678a381f0b3ac7246cf58bdbb6751abc","25b05d79ee5b632b7163a1baa9e4517bc5909d9c","d8a1800277e27bf07ef8216e528898426736caa0"],"title":"Bayesian Parametric Accelerated Failure Time Spatial Model and its Application to Prostate Cancer.","doi":"10.1080/02664760903521476"}

Following a Bayesian paradigm, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to analyze multivariate nominal measures through multivariate multinomial probit models. As with a univariate version of the model, identification of model parameters requires restrictions on the covariance matrix of the latent variables that are introduced to define the probit specification. To sample the covariance matrix with restrictions within the MCMC procedure, we use a parameter-extended Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that incorporates artificial variance parameters to transform the problem into a set of simpler tasks including sampling an unrestricted covariance matrix. The parameter-extended algorithm also allows for flexible prior distributions on covariance matrices. The prior specification in the method described here generalizes earlier approaches to analyzing univariate nominal data, and the multivariate correlation structure in the method described here generalizes the autoregressive structure proposed in previous multiperiod multinomial probit models. Our methodology is illustrated through a simulated example and an application to a cancer-control study aiming to achieve early detection of breast cancer.","inCitations":["54afe7bcf84c6ef5720d99098b63798cbedd6e4d","fda2b8ac3634569cd964ae0e588b42ac7db7114e","78aef7cd1536a86d2e03fae22ae8c23f84c93d74","1ae7203eec3d85cf3ca534fdc6a7c1ba209e9a4c","5d5045027ab00b925060ca5f3909b9841329531e","cedffd7ef405210cdf3cedf4c67ef85be6aaff65","1720f190be3e4a48d7a3ec4e27a84edc5f19073c","a328faf454bec0ad841aed0084ce8ce475b75d46","dc5e56200058be7940c2cb38aaa90a767a8dc988","c08e9307cc387bed298335f32a983a2eebf81b85","c23eba9e085603cea29c58e4be3dd46ab6ba471c","c136b3dbab29ed5819b88cd1831dffd9e88478c4","190d18e6e810961a7cef9b7de3900c9cd68ffb02","0b7d8baa633736050b74a827928274099513948a","00f5829a1281b5331daaa3eb9199aa3405b92e05","73a73996e028a61dac38a4a41ca00932e3b45dab","e1064a15b12784b93e756c4170ccf2256715b6b9","3a0cfed11613aefebd031ee75e3c13c1c34e46ce","b8d889229ff64fde573dba9a45a746ae2329b07c"],"title":"Bayesian analysis of multivariate nominal measures using multivariate multinomial probit models","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2007.12.012"}

To address these challenges, we propose a high-dimensional varying-coefficient model for incorporating functional aspects of phenotypic traits into GWAS to formulate a so-called functional GWAS or fGWAS. Bayesian group lasso and the associated MCMC algorithms are developed to identify significant SNPs and estimate how they affect longitudinal traits through time-varying genetic actions. The model is generalized to analyze the genetic control of complex traits using subject-specific sparse longitudinal data. The statistical properties of the new model are investigated through simulation studies. We use the new model to analyze a real GWAS data set from the Framingham Heart Study, leading to the identification of several significant SNPs associated with age-specific changes of body mass index. The fGWAS model, equipped with Bayesian group lassso, will provide a useful tool for genetic and developmental analysis of complex traits or diseases.","inCitations":["0fd5870984c4dc34a85acf9ea24a18cd865d2c8d","8135a0cd8fe536885e86bf087432ff33c0379d17","5fd0360abbf2d37eb2fdea8886f19d2b89e91573","97ef8f433b1c6449f75485502c2099e965719743","e229037576d7c7b7b38063953b51f84a7f21f64a","af57c58a08236f66d6dc34c133aafb859967b449","07b2db1125140be4970ffb64ee07321dcbc1ec3d","ff07dc4e00e79581c566c2990ccc59260fa83add","312e176846a588f59d9a4e848611248b55e42714","dcfcf47269e9192fdb143e59c54a02296f42ad64","e1fc855d5760b4cb93491f37feeeaf7a3a01280d","620c70d15be3a72b696c7363eb0bf9a8343ae47c","72d4c99321ac0f64227b1d6e225fd858311e0154","d4f22e4e1f21aabf395cc69bc8d0ec048b92e288","7426d7a695eec308e9d0089dc37e86fe4dd0267e","bb989b7339adf5cd34604552d7ed4329f2158735","388a13dfbde0f6bdfcc5f6bdcf49926be9fc64db","a081cef56dfdaa09101bf52f6a1de5a87ff5a659","77f0201f5d2fbea6216bc794060cc21d2f2fe255"],"title":"Bayesian Group Lasso for Nonparametric Varying-coefficient Models with Application to Functional Genome-wide Association Studies.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS808"}

Here, we propose an efficient p-value evaluation procedure by adapting the stochastic approximation Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The new procedure can be used easily for estimating the p-value for any resampling-based test. We show through numeric simulations that the proposed procedure can be 100-500 000 times as efficient (in term of computing time) as the standard resampling-based procedure when evaluating a test statistic with a small p-value (e.g. less than 10( - 6)). With its computational burden reduced by this proposed procedure, the versatile resampling-based test would become computationally feasible for a much wider range of applications.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we show that in the presence of right censoring, when the right end-point of the support of the censoring time is strictly less than the right end-point of the support of the semi-Markov kernel, the transition probability of the semi-Markov process is nonidentifiable, and the estimators proposed in the literature are inconsistent in general. We derive the set of all attainable values for the transition probability based on the censored data, and we propose a nonparametric inference procedure for the transition probability using this set. Second, the conventional approach to constructing confidence bands is not applicable for the semi-Markov kernel and the sojourn time distribution. We propose new perturbation resampling methods to construct these confidence bands. Different weights and transformations are explored in the construction. We use simulation to examine our proposals and illustrate them with hospitalization data from a recent cancer survivor study.","inCitations":["8627ad165c30db48a77973ca30a3a14b80e04d16","9f2b5841095afe3534130dae677cc386b9bb3315"],"title":"Estimation with Right-Censored Observations Under A Semi-Markov Model.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.11176"}

These design techniques, such as D-optimality, provide the optimum experimental conditions. The performance of the optimum design will depend on the ability of the investigator to comply with the proposed study conditions. However, in clinical settings it is not possible to comply exactly with the optimum design and hence some degree of unplanned suboptimality occurs due to error in the execution of the study. In addition, due to the nonlinear relationship of the parameters of these models to the data, the designs are also locally dependent on an arbitrary choice of a nominal set of parameter values. A design that is robust to both study conditions and uncertainty in the nominal set of parameter values is likely to be of use clinically. We propose an adaptive design strategy to account for both execution error and uncertainty in the parameter values. In this study we investigate designs for a one-compartment first-order pharmacokinetic model. We do this in a Bayesian framework using Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

Owing to ethical constraint, they are based on adaptive designs, sequentially allocating patients to increased doses on the basis of previous responses. More recently, the concept of MTD has been extended to the largest concept of most successful or most desirable dose, based on efficacy criterion under toxicity restrictions. The aim of this paper is to present three main approaches proposed to estimate such a dose, in the setting of Phase I/II trials. Two case-studies allow to illustrate these new approaches.","inCitations":["4c3140230ca4d025941f4c02f8c62117dd2c81aa","1d938fbf7ed59ba63717f85b3a1036a77037fea0","1cd5467106eb0f612e8ea799a9c7973f8c56aa91","5b2ea87e47fc20818673b3e455bf81b1fff597e5","42caa775871d6a319a40038d519a709b18359a11","3e62aefc06952e880d21346dd1e2ab3562197f51","18b7aa5eee1dd6499fa0e0b7f478e56d0a2bb246","10cd7f35842e4ffc79228ddd085fe8fc6630017f","1bc72ba0e34495d9eeeed4116e409f80de8cb515","fc8d8a623db6b51922c6cd61d882e6e2861461be","f77f8c50595b0fb2e7be92ffa909645ad8f53bb6","582f61dd6336dd644ff75a1b0260cc6d51238cdf","f936e9a509c3462eeca3d2eb2af3f982ae874044","8ffc93523d8e915d7543c68eeca77a8a8b72ead8","1eab21c8dfccd04d53dcd1bb9753410a05ea2307","65f48a042071b9218d301fe2da27139361f39669"],"title":"Recent developments in adaptive designs for Phase I/II dose-finding studies.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701645116"}

It allows us to monitor the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. A common task with microarray is to determine which genes are differentially expressed between two samples obtained under two different conditions. Recently, several statistical methods have been proposed to perform such a task when there are replicate samples under each condition. Two major problems arise with microarray data. The first one is that the number of replicates is very small (usually 2-10), leading to noisy point estimates. As a consequence, traditional statistics that are based on the means and standard deviations, e.g. t-statistic, are not suitable. The second problem is that the number of genes is usually very large (approximately 10,000), and one is faced with an extreme multiple testing problem. Most multiple testing adjustments are relatively conservative, especially when the number of replicates is small. In this paper we present an empirical Bayes analysis that handles both problems very well. Using different parametrizations, we develop four statistics that can be used to test hypotheses about the means and/or variances of the gene expression levels in both one- and two-sample problems. The methods are illustrated using experimental data with prior knowledge. In addition, we present the result of a simulation comparing our methods to well-known statistics and multiple testing adjustments.","inCitations":["004520127d706032c9bd36b8c98457b5385345a3","7271470e2badda1ea1801387affcfe7319c7dca1","7db7987e55d3fc189a09d1323cded1bbf110319b","25da657800cd63b2ed2316169b555387b0242903","aecc5c59958d72d48cb97bef9a8dbb60feb10a5a","41c7197add562736c7e511c9d1e51f47ebf4d7d8","c66633c4dc44b760a8d888af4f1e770a17e30d15","dbd876812d6c67a14eab27579551d63520494e90","87c8add43542291388faad64e9e91759d277ea2a","075ce2886cb1d6d83417e48adcd2c8713eb1ddf9","1c5665edac542d90d489ef80ffa851d9c0ed4c27","cd592deabdcd14fba296bab40173f6a959d6d4e5","7470c4e9b71f59ecfcb34beb5115d47307ae3e66","82610204f421387b07158e03ad32bceacfaa3825","5010aec812c7f6515692501686e93800cd97afc2","5a975f73e954f49a1321852ff9fd9999a0157da4","45c1cb789f5b62975947182371a248ef677b659f","54ec3eb01c9874478906cec8b4c8e2bc4e05a2db","974adb4d033400c0b8596a1c439530b489458b7e","323dd0cf02e6335cace32fcf2d7de4740dc8c2c6","b6ee933cb0ed090bda75ceab561fa403c5590a18","e588cdc331bce50851cccd843e57d70afb2e2aec","203744a1191ea57405f87636b9997a2910db4931","9e499d94ef286da94c1cb93affd6c47bc467f9c8","951b8dfbf7adcc50149e34e83fbdedc656108957","9bbc6771a50ae1efa831c662eb1e026b94d12d0e","fbf14c88d94febe28d375b07a27594e77381bf6a","cece72692b2d6b4d3450c2d9e59d91c28f251abf","8a2c72bcec19a456d82e15dbf1786b0ad3ee01bb","4acac3c0c67f6bfc8937d33b1c18796371eff279","52cd1d0277e7e23945b70a810f5839633fd2a1a7","e715c5cb0f0b89bb1936440fa7b50e8f015a0fca","b93d84a97f09664ec72d65682ef460cbac59fa09","ee0a003588047474568a24bd4ccdc3d9cdf5ecdf","ebfb054cff29f32c1bb3fa00fdac5f92df44a08a","f95a40bdc6e81c91a8e7934c7f3f905ef861183a","9351c18b56892247ab74e612acad405ed4832747","a6ead6a50066a6c824ff9ee020c2540552d19ef9","8c0dbb007bde2339ce0f563f058f023d8ba47163","d210c110b46cd3b18087d239cbd23db5425a4332"],"title":"Statistical analysis of microarray data: a Bayesian approach.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.4.597"}

The first method is good at identifying small clusters but not large ones; the strengths are reversed for the second method. The hybrid method is built on the new idea of a mutual cluster: a group of points closer to each other than to any other points. Theoretical connections between mutual clusters and bottom-up clustering methods are established, aiding in their interpretation and providing an algorithm for identification of mutual clusters. We illustrate the technique on simulated and real microarray datasets.","inCitations":["c946a7dd040788665960e5d1fb663c7378c97f9e","9be3206f7e69652455667d72b744b5593a3b5899","7502de59e547c4e1f5044e3cc900f226494f1be6","9e9fbdb955061fb37e1f19284a6d70b53fea8e1f","078d1f25d3febb6ebae415f1f92d1800b8b8c90b","628cd88b49c894eabb3730c69d817a31e8f8c74b","98f9707ff372bb062d29c209e850c47305771443","fa9fe2e9e13ca1bc5be18241d1f4d33d7183262d","53d070d814bffceea0a874f0336022239df8632a","34954048ff8016aaaf40ece6ffe47f1b5e070d23","60ae6045db2712f8025402606dfc57b3ac2886de","693f7f1ca5583752812229fd32da9b1888d30304","4edea168aa0c671aa1e2e8c075e1110fa1764863","218f491c84776070f1219bc43a629b81de319aac","c07cab883c3c12f208a98bc0d6fc218b05bd6960","80d9f695fd3c8fe756cc7a78869e053077738e4e","2d97ac1c371ac923c715afb35b879413197e46c5","a80eb63bea6766fc6443e60abb5c47119f732b10","c104d89c4cc72c935ab0e387fd16769b1f045093","c8765d201f80d65cb149777dd0d2c3a5514ae00e","d7e763d8b9e65a1e702969c16528d7070521b198","83e8cd3455c12b6cae423cdb7cd78469f0b5a6ad","a59396a08e600617595939f358b737c363685ed8","92066c26f5c618b58a854b7bd3185b3addc00021","eef5f6732f80973659f84bbdc2d43eda3a6a3aa1","d3ed2cc363e6a6dd143cb797cdce94f61b1de0d5","dce1437a9d8b0dab51abf02407b36d4e04cf1232","47cf1505c1393f358a579663bfeea34c38f87539","ce1154cdb7edbe6979f044225a5615e5d3f65b88","e588f2f9ced62ad24f84ac30d5da8c671a673de4","a7a83234dfb3e7d5909116c4e40cae515705278c","adef1691b3c10eaa445507f4543e96a1ce5bcdab","eaec84b84afbd009f7d54a792db7c2b4b978e46c","d4279f913271d93ef17b620cef7f7f5237a63f35","b6010f0e05690e6f1c53c86f7ac3e430b331e150","4539c81d9c93d21d95ae7acc13d0c30b26913c74","028a78060e74473042550f86ad3620cf67cadab5","249da211127a37231e7c6689c489981dbfc08640","d3dfcdd49179086cae641154cca52b0e343747b2","228544eccd7b397e6a9ab8da9865ab967cfb4861","bf75a2f81e2d8a20e8abcef39659ec227e98c74b","af747987fa1c8e3aae4f76563c08a1eec68852c3","40da11d3041f787de1f824fd3478dbfe968c2618","9f3a35ddddf6cf8559c155130ce962ec9bf881ae","afb80fd107a043ca7a4e23cd60e14b6a56870fde","36e736f7e4292b964fb6c73dd16d41eb4a0da574","cdec13e2176398887d0fda74b0951b54b9e2885c","c05ff19149fc4e7fd3afea5a69e07c0905bc51bd","a4d4f7497a9f40400c04ea618097d99a71ac1245","c3215c1c903d4fd04d7649ae0cd51fb3bea64618","42be0bab1fa890f7a618628e0784fcb9655a27de","01144bfb135641a4c38ee267017b15be92606177","1c3be6e7339f1889d93cb33317eb65fc9c23f28b","95c5df06e283d201558eacafb108f074f12956be","23c9c0f2c6280ad3eb8db0b11d27a434979629cc","f4350c5d099195a9203ffe3be52e48003de7fbdf","bc66d536feed232cd9463f4cced1156b4fe21738","6ab6471681bf567f500439f0439a3cdf76eb670a","4e66081ce3a28200642e1ba43e9165bee440dd91","a7c900050a25e35413fd06a450e1333e1c3a6880","336c0dcac3e9c462fa41e150b3cfd2b416229493","3d123b2dbccb6027d4f54f7c671f40bcbf873d2e","77b8a18d5eef6a454ea37df8bd25de164698b842","a11b80a631df91f6a4b914a6b60cd87a9a7dff77","35f29afd5d5562767007e4484faffbd1150668b5","06d5b0ef194e9735e0a2a38e165b103ba2b22e7b","49ae2bf8ffc959792d5dc47ab9844c38a15804da","9c0f24bce75a968afb7d3c7ba08f3825c7603fa7","05112eb027e568b8f37149b5d2b1b666bd41dc2e","9a6c493e8c88fae418240b951c7ff7a5b525e3ab","75db7494ed1c49343c0d1834c322c81bc3a514b4","f536a7ff1fe71c2ef7664a775910bc5e166d96be","dcf7fca2019e45aaeb6b141afacce706e102892a","7f50534167ba2b8e4c2eaf24165863a2a68c3341","a13f8a814810ba08e6064bf79d1aa671cf539a71","33fae16f7a656594580dba8f6b803577f16e581a","ffad3f85aee4af1e0181f92d6f8c519245de61cf","b1e1bf6f8691596845c954b9e172f17e4ec4ad5d","ae46754490794690b50e18a88f449f00a689c48d","2dfd2e1fec16718f461d15722dfed16b5f7b9d88","ad7b65d266d6a5da7d743baef16ace559021be7d","bbb18e14b8d48e191a24acb5b699d085256db902","e65e5f8be9b2061608a8aedf82b4364dd7919622","d06fc06f1597a6fcea9fdc1db840aba9393bd213","e39fe3d4b35a828761240c420c8420c4036dca42","0849740ca9519ca009703af8614ab36543e6cafb","7faa935f4c262fe0b7cd72fb45df1d9ee4363c9f"],"title":"Hybrid hierarchical clustering with applications to microarray data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj007"}

The point masses at the boundaries prevent the routine use of logit and other commonly used transformations of (0, 1) data. We introduce a model augmentation with latent variables that allow for the desired positive probability at 0 and 1 in the model. A linear mixed effect model is imposed on the latent variables. We propose a Bayesian semiparametric model for the random effects distribution. Specifically, we use a Polya tree prior for the unknown random effects distribution. The proposed model can capture possible multimodality and skewness of random effect distribution. We discuss implementation of posterior inference by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed model is illustrated by a simulation study and a cancer study in dogs.","inCitations":["3815a67f1a7b726fbccbe3973225470fea5ae842"],"title":"Semiparametric Bayesian inference for repeated fractional measurement data.","doi":""}

Given that error cannot be totally eliminated, bias correction methods of analysis are needed. Many methods require more than one exposure measurement per person to be made, but the `group mean OLS method,' in which subjects are grouped into several a priori defined groups followed by ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on the group means, can be applied with one measurement. An alternative approach is to use an instrumental variable (IV) method in which both the single error-prone measure and an IV are used in IV analysis. In this paper we show that the `group mean OLS' estimator is equal to an IV estimator with the group mean used as IV, but that the variance estimators for the two methods are different. We derive a simple expression for the bias in the common estimator which is a simple function of group size, reliability and contrast of exposure between groups, and show that the bias can be very small when group size is large. We compare this method with a new proposal (group mean ranking method), also applicable with a single exposure measurement, in which the IV is the rank of the group means. When there are two independent exposure measurements per subject, we propose a new IV method (EVROS IV) and compare it with Carroll and Stefanski's (CS IV) proposal in which the second measure is used as an IV; the new IV estimator combines aspects of the `group mean' and `CS' strategies. All methods are evaluated in terms of bias, precision and root mean square error via simulations and a dataset from occupational epidemiology. The `group mean ranking method' does not offer much improvement over the `group mean method.' Compared with the `CS' method, the `EVROS' method is less affected by low reliability of exposure. We conclude that the group IV methods we propose may provide a useful way to handle mismeasured exposures in epidemiology with or without replicate measurements. Our finding may also have implications for the use of aggregate variables in epidemiology to control for unmeasured confounding.","inCitations":["8e697de3756ae8e30575d37e4257f82eaa4d3fab","00bc691613344da029065cbcb33d461cb7fc64e2"],"title":"Instrumental Variables vs. Grouping Approach for Reducing Bias Due to Measurement Error","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1087"}
