If the goal is to show that the experimental treatment is not sufficiently worse than the control, then a decision rule based on the magnitude of one confidence limit can be used. A procedure suggested by the Food and Drug Administration allows the value to which the confidence limit is to be compared to depend on the data. The consequences of determining the sample size assuming that the aforementioned value is fixed are examined. The probability of declaring equivalence and exact sample sizes are also presented for the procedure.","inCitations":["9420cf529a183fb336cb8aed58b266eeec3e4442","0ea5105feeae61cb06d20adcd3df11c4880ef9d5","47bb61af84b57edf9eaa25bc263c87622437e0d7"],"title":"Determining equivalence and the impact of sample size in anti-infective studies: a point to consider.","doi":"10.1080/10543409608835146"}

A multi-step approach is developed that simultaneously estimates the parametric components and the nonparametric function. Under certain regularity conditions, it is shown that the resulting estimators is consistent and asymptotic normal for the parametric part and achieve the optimal rate of convergence for the nonparametric part when the bandwidth is suitably chosen. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and finite-sample performance of the method. The method is also applied to a SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry data set from a study of liver cancer patients.","inCitations":["35ced77e63dd152a062a7128b5833f1f6e655420"],"title":"Functional and Parametric Estimation in a Semi- and Nonparametric Model with Application to Mass-Spectrometry Data","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2014-0066"}

However, existing methods for model selection in marginal regression analysis of longitudinal data fail to address the potential bias resulting from these issues. To tackle this problem, we propose a new model selection criterion, the Generalized Longitudinal Information Criterion, which is based on an approximately unbiased estimator for the expected quadratic error of a considered marginal model accounting for both data missingness and covariate measurement error. The simulation results reveal that the proposed method performs quite well in the presence of missing data and covariate measurement error. On the contrary, the naive procedures without taking care of such complexity in data may perform quite poorly. The proposed method is applied to data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging to assess the relationship of depression with health and social status in the elderly, accommodating measurement error in the covariate as well as missing observations.","inCitations":["7b9e586c64a08fb1da1a66953df45aba220586a4","8b0f15195fe7ea757b8e971a209e73a2f2bf75ca","9743131484f6cfe01352bbb2c6a7f10bdd1c2a72"],"title":"Model selection for marginal regression analysis of longitudinal data with missing observations and covariate measurement error.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv024"}

This dogma too often has seemed to influence the applications of statistics, even at agencies like the FDA. Greg Campbell was one of the most important advocates there for more nuanced modes of thought, especially Bayesian statistics. Because two brilliant statisticians, Ronald Fisher and Jerzy Neyman, are often credited with instilling the traditional frequentist approach in current practice, I argue that both men were actually seeking very Bayesian answers, and neither would have endorsed the rigid application of their ideas.","inCitations":["81e9e41d4b7e3d16948b668e286144bb4bb3e43d"],"title":"Fisher, Neyman, and Bayes at FDA.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1226333"}

In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient EM algorithm, facilitated by a gamma-poisson data augmentation, for maximum likelihood estimation in a class of generalized odds rate mixture cure (GORMC) models with interval censored data. The gamma-poisson data augmentation greatly simplifies the EM estimation and enhances the convergence speed of the EM algorithm. The empirical properties of the proposed method are examined through extensive simulation studies and compared with numerical maximum likelihood estimates. An R package \"GORCure\" is developed to implement the proposed method and its use is illustrated by an application to the Aerobic Center Longitudinal Study dataset.","inCitations":["ccef5d7b64e115508b3a209b3f7694386903408e","045b0ab0ade7881b2939bee0cbbdc74cb8406085","c540a0c110f02a858d9b9f67e5b12503bf71daa1"],"title":"Computationally Efficient Estimation for the Generalized Odds Rate Mixture Cure Model with Interval-Censored Data.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2017.1349665"}

Depending on the clinical context, the nature of these deviations will vary widely. Examples might include the addition of rescue medication, reduction or discontinuation of the study drug, and other. In some studies this deviation may be determined entirely by the clinical measurements recorded in the trial database. For example, in a blood pressure reduction trial the patient’s blood pressure may have exceeded a predefined level triggering a change of drugs. In such a setting, the reason for deviation depends only on fully observed data, so we can talk of deviation at random (defined by analogy to missing at random, noting that this is conditional on that patient’s observed data). However, it may be that the reason for deviation depends on measurements not recorded in the database, either in general or just for this patient.

In addition to quadratic programming, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and also derive an efficient solution path algorithm. Through both simulations and benchmark data examples, we compare the different algorithms and provide practical recommendations in terms of efficiency and accuracy for various sizes of data. We also show that, for an arbitrary penalty matrix, the generalized lasso can be transformed to a constrained lasso, while the converse is not true. Thus, our methods can also be used for estimating a generalized lasso, which has wide-ranging applications.

The phenomenon was originally described in terms of perceptual performance, and has been well replicated in that sense. That human observers can apparently turn images about axes of rotation or reflection, and correctly construct identifications of objects whose images have been transformed in a virtual mental space, is uncontested but in some ways unexplained. The phenomenon raises fundamental questions about the nature of mathematical assumptions within psychological theory, and suggests a need for the reconciliation of phenomenological, neuropsychological and mathematical descriptions within one compatible framework. It is concluded that what actually happens is not rotation in the geometrical sense but a serial operation that may be confused with rotation, and may sometimes yield the same terminal result. A bibliography of major sources on the experimental and mathematical analyses of the mental rotation of images of 2-d and 3-d figures has been compiled.","inCitations":["d93b199b1c4217f5d75d5da1f900e40a2b7345a4"],"title":"Confusing rotation-like operations in space, mind and brain.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1998.tb00671.x"}

The mixed-effects model has been a useful tool for the analysis of such data. There are situations in which the parameters of the model are subject to some restrictions or constraints. For example, in hearing loss studies, we expect hearing to deteriorate with time. This means that hearing thresholds which reflect hearing acuity will, on average, increase over time. Therefore, the regression coefficients associated with the mean effect of time on hearing ability will be constrained. Such constraints should be accounted for in the analysis. We propose maximum likelihood estimation procedures, based on the expectation-conditional maximization either algorithm, to estimate the parameters of the model while accounting for the constraints on them. The proposed methods improve, in terms of mean square error, on the unconstrained estimators. In some settings, the improvement may be substantial. Hypotheses testing procedures that incorporate the constraints are developed. Specifically, likelihood ratio, Wald, and score tests are proposed and investigated. Their empirical significance levels and power are studied using simulations. It is shown that incorporating the constraints improves the mean squared error of the estimates and the power of the tests. These improvements may be substantial. The methodology is used to analyze a hearing loss study.","inCitations":["7caac37af20b2c886ce446201fbbf992c8b82b24","e8bf5d9b2c9868103d4fa3b758c4501e6bec5d52","928e46649a8a14e8dd24c34b69f7245484bd5c20","24bb8064e144fc8a5aab4793ce28e1eb60519cd8","bd36990e731b4ce59f56a328bc7ce42531929817","f58fa14c0e406280e6b3dd68c70fa20043667259"],"title":"Constrained inference in mixed-effects models for longitudinal data with application to hearing loss.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq051"}

With now over 20 years of studies on WM, each study with tiny sample sizes, there is a need for meta-analysis to identify the brain regions consistently activated by WM tasks, and to understand the inter-study variation in those activations. However, current methods in the field cannot fully account for the spatial nature of neuroimaging meta-analysis data or the heterogeneity observed among WM studies. In this work, we propose a fully Bayesian random-effects meta-regression model based on log-Gaussian Cox processes, which can be used for meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. An efficient MCMC scheme for posterior simulations is presented which makes use of some recent advances in parallel computing using graphics processing units (GPUs). Application of the proposed model to a real dataset provides valuable insights regarding the function of the WM.","inCitations":["c0a1cf1962a9ce4904f322d08fb39c161783965a"],"title":"Bayesian log-Gaussian Cox process regression: with applications to meta-analysis of neuroimaging working memory studies.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12295"}

Alternative statistical methods are therefore needed to better address the effects of noncompliance in noninferiority trials. In this paper, we consider the use of the instrumental variables (IV) estimator in a noninferiority trial with a binary outcome and evaluate the performance of this approach in comparison to other conventional analytic methods. Unlike the ITT, per-protocol, and as-treated approaches, the IV method provides an unbiased estimate of the average causal effect of treatment among the subgroup of compliers and maintains the nominal type I error rate, but does increase the sample size requirements of the study as the expected proportion of noncompliers increases. Further development of the IV estimator for more general patterns of noncompliance would be useful and would encourage broader application of this method in noninferiority trials.","inCitations":["30e575fbce864be687822f79a983031fe80969ae","aa13855a55c8e6d9acb318727426afff08d73d40","654073148d09cf4aa9deaff0716857b2c33c9536","14c9d40aa68d047ab189da3df2e83673b15830d7","3edd5c9e210cad9e7145dea8894f37eae572af2a"],"title":"Using the instrumental variables estimator to analyze noninferiority trials with noncompliance.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003618157"}

Unfortunately, this ideal is not realized. Measurements are made on peptides requiring an inferential step to obtain protein level estimates. The inference is complicated by experimental factors that necessitate relative abundance estimation and result in widespread non-ignorable missing data. Relative abundance on the log scale takes the form of parameter contrasts. In a complete-case analysis, contrast estimates may be biased by missing data and a substantial amount of useful information will often go unused. To avoid problems with missing data, many analysts have turned to single imputation solutions. Unfortunately, these methods often create further difficulties by hiding inestimable contrasts, preventing the recovery of interblock information and failing to account for imputation uncertainty. To mitigate many of the problems caused by missing values, we propose the use of a Bayesian selection model. Our model is tested on simulated data, real data with simulated missing values, and on a ground truth dilution experiment where all of the true relative changes are known. The analysis suggests that our model, compared with various imputation strategies and complete-case analyses, can increase accuracy and provide substantial improvements to interval coverage.","inCitations":["6e19e6bb94f785916752be61aa169dc11f6aa05c"],"title":"The effects of nonignorable missing data on label-free mass spectrometry proteomics experiments.","doi":"10.1214/18-AOAS1144"}

The survey contains binary, ordinal and nominal items. In the absence of income or expenditure data, the SES landscape in the study population is explored and described by clustering the households into homogeneous groups based on their asset status. A model-based approach to clustering the Agincourt households, based on latent variable models, is proposed. In the case of modeling binary or ordinal items, item response theory models are employed. For nominal survey items, a factor analysis model, similar in nature to a multinomial probit model, is used. Both model types have an underlying latent variable structure-this similarity is exploited and the models are combined to produce a hybrid model capable of handling mixed data types. Further, a mixture of the hybrid models is considered to provide clustering capabilities within the context of mixed binary, ordinal and nominal response data. The proposed model is termed a mixture of factor analyzers for mixed data (MFA-MD). The MFA-MD model is applied to the survey data to cluster the Agincourt households into homogeneous groups. The model is estimated within the Bayesian paradigm, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Intuitive groupings result, providing insight to the different socio-economic strata within the Agincourt region.","inCitations":["fd24124bd6f2323514cb117511b0d24bf3171769","03f8849602439abee2bd8da1bf3a2debabe73991","37489dcf92e089bb8fd1f77d9ac2c4f5a5aa08ac","4885193ef8d71af7849414525756bbf8a106d818","fcefb5d8fadff1a8b37b3cb7751f8f2ca8ec204b","084d62471a403d946c20db2149d6b481c1fbf127","78b41b36d44536be78e8d795192791506b92153e","23c2ad27d77338d2abdaffa347072f6d78268544","fea5ec1d875b3c05122ce8f2569372c3646ec1de","9771ae76b50e99d6e8c09111bb93696d99907439","c25d995cbc5dfe585ddf3b1f13c3e58b71320da8","c7065d79a41b2b47f3275e3231d1804d75bcd7c1","096d3c1ef7ec711da19cad43f409626d3e16b89f","6aee33f19d324b7e5e02df4ad77f995b6e98bee3","042782e0bf040eb0d458caeaeafc44b754fe72c3","ce8456f16f3d99dbe39bd6ea127479e407d66b0e","c08e9307cc387bed298335f32a983a2eebf81b85","2f49bb5e2e4c11049347d0685e1092e8137b3496"],"title":"Clustering South African Households Based on Their Asset Status Using Latent Variable Models.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS726"}

The case of the Red Queen hypothesis being addressed here is when the homogeneous taxonomic group is a group of similar species. Since Van Valen's work, various statistical approaches have been used to address the relationship between taxon age and the rate of extinction. We propose a general class of test statistics that can be used to test for the effect of age on the rate of extinction. These test statistics allow for a varying background rate of extinction and attempt to remove the effects of other covariates when assessing the effect of age on extinction. No model is assumed for the covariate effects. Instead we control for covariate effects by pairing or grouping together similar species. Simulations are used to compare the power of the statistics. We apply the test statistics to data on Foram extinctions and find that age has a positive effect on the rate of extinction.

In this article, we develop a maximum likelihood method to estimate AUC and relative exposure (i.e., ratio of two AUCs) when data below LLOQ exists. We also compare the proposed method to several commonly used methods, including imputation with model-predicted values or ad hoc values (i.e., LLOQ, LLOQ/2, or zero) through a simulation study.

In previous work, authors have considered structure learning of Gaussian graphical models and structure learning of discrete models. Our approach is a natural generalization of these two lines of work to the mixed case. The penalization scheme involves a novel symmetric use of the group-lasso norm and follows naturally from a particular parametrization of the model.

This is an important issue in assay validation because the accuracy and reliability of the assay result depend on the selected standard curve. In this study, we propose a selection procedure, which is based on the R2 and the mean squared error of the estimation sample, to determine the \"best\" model. An example concerning an assay validation study is used to illustrate the application of the proposed procedure to discriminate among the five commonly used statistical models.","inCitations":["7dca7a49a0e64a9ed27e480d0f39ee344fc535fd","5c776e69fef18a902eb858aa5701550490d9b53a"],"title":"On model selection for standard curve in assay development.","doi":"10.1080/10543409508835114"}
