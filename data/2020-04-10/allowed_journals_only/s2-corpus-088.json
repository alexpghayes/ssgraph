The longitudinal pattern of gaps between successive recurrent events is often of great research interest. In this article, the probability structure of the recurrent gap times is first explored in the presence of censoring. According to the discovered structure, we introduce the stratified proportional reverse-time hazards models with unspecified baseline functions to accommodate individual heterogeneity, when the longitudinal pattern parameter is of main interest. Inference procedures are proposed and studied by way of proper riskset construction. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by the Monte Carlo simulations and an application to a well-known Denmark schizophrenia cohort study data set.","inCitations":["6c0cbc44c073cc07c0c3e4148512f996a01fd88b","7c7be27303e41c4a65f9cb10d2ba6716b96d7c46","32aa90202be495c8cedd353590b6502e495b8e20","223247b9cb070f1ea6530ba8b469e8c166b6f697","e2756b0c0a6b3e00795e8b324b79ce48b7a10af5","c8ed73cc83cd1cb73eed7e3fc23382d1684efd7c","72627846394f415a96578f83d68aab75ca03e9df","31e9363e9615d67524579f88f40494897e8d4a3a","379f3fed992206aad4cf3a28da92336b48454cd9","fd1b94e600b4110b11aadab84f598b24ed055504"],"title":"Semiparametric regression analysis on longitudinal pattern of recurrent gap times.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.2.277"}

RGCCA is a component-based approach which aims to study the relationships between several sets of variables. The quality and interpretability of the RGCCA components are likely to be affected by the usefulness and relevance of the variables in each block. Therefore, it is an important issue to identify within each block which subsets of significant variables are active in the relationships between blocks. In this paper, RGCCA is extended to address the issue of variable selection. Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) is proposed to combine RGCCA with an [Formula: see text]-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes SGCCA a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems. Finally, the versatility and usefulness of SGCCA are illustrated on a simulated dataset and on a 3-block dataset which combine gene expression, comparative genomic hybridization, and a qualitative phenotype measured on a set of 53 children with glioma. SGCCA is available on CRAN as part of the RGCCA package.","inCitations":["76910848eec01447e8c9cf3b33a4f0a24191d0f3","93000ca3f86e88e23630ee56052fc7d963b1e973","1c3b561a708e32ce47a0d83da6246e1553d7c6c3","bea25f35495e87990a3221cbfb5ac0bf7dbe083c","0fc87fb2d61659441c44246dbdc186403676010c","a2eaf814a7e93826c418afe2bb1ad689065ecf54","2337a7983a6e2837aeaa49dbcf45adebf5f16f9c","55c4500b5f2f863b3e37d492c91983dc139b700f","db28acedc212fe812d74ebbca1a2c954678fa300","caf63f98a5020c4e0cb1825794b7125a596958f7","a2b355b57919d56895faa3fea23d6c035efe0371","ef33d7ef68cf41f47c6d32dc9d499f5d964defc1","800336a016ef20754c1d1c185bcda6d338509963","f2d1f3f5013ad8bc0181732e380b10da6250d2d1","4afc280eaabe833da9acef4e42823dc5dbc04046","7e4693faf6f2f1f56212ab6a4fcc140d17e2bc40","9b4811c3590a9af1b79c241aa6ccbf78bccf8e95","54a5ec2d4ad85978c542f25184664ad69762f298","570e5b01ff3edb741382ff5e788b9da33d8a9cf2","bcb4efdaf254cf3e8bb2f36f7d399a4c5e46fb9a","7953f13bc46b059db0ef6960e0a02429d2908871","bc25b55384995ed5ab8afa9912e00a4215427233","d0ab97dbf74bbcc853c484e8ac5ba93c2e45c38b","91c7f4287ab6dc943eb869c5b3d420e28e68a04f","2065637fa647127bed3adde4363d41c9743ee1f5","a27833a8524e836ed09d61361320ccaf6fea3df3","b366956dbd32bc5c7e0d045519e8a8c7a1065eb4","c118ad7490af2837b687e48ab237eaae1b69c462","8ce7e54dc6c89d65c0ca0ea786de21784d4d53bb","7e9f4cab98d08ae624ace84dfc4638021240f237","3e0a92255928de55fffea569305585c400a6e5a6","3489d8362b34d3c49279a321eb820670e3bca05d","eff62ceb4cec5e4c6497664caac9194fc34657bf","09056b32e48108db6286ff7eff8cc33542b6f4c5","f3d48ef990500eeda1059efa0605f3e1a0c413f7","4a5cd2b9c3a21dc5941d0571fc81066b37391c31","2cf92b4eca05880733850aea66f7e1bae0a75f5f","ead6850c9c80a43334e1e4492c1574e9320d0b17","922dbed92ed1160eafbe5a96ab56800acd8e7353","c874d8d690227c76c6c1028b904e6f44d64e6adb","d6cbab343a4e4ea6f8503fb17885c46ed0e20ff1","168320d4046f2d8f633fd22474bf1501f6d0cbb5","02b6e9b083208dfc4ba41148e2cc95c10cdf2962","ec1dd15a123685a4cfe9e060dd3359e3bda00a70","a6de749c51841540995aca039a7e75e1120ba7ff","8c3b4436ef4d5ce6ea68d578c9fe3642ac80e370","3f3b339a7b57cf17129924a8e301fa3fe932bf86","bdb4a88a1391a5487925970cf5ea91c801bf4c7b","69c9188f7d0a2acaa04c1e275a98d06eee130acd","2aff62f1a1f5d6ca34feff3ebf8aa48376bf79f3","0e036b3aa82aa9202bac8e2000c6a0159bc38360","5e35fdcdf9bdec0ac4deaa0ae9f366fa24f050c8","13653c06f1cecd84cc692f6195c33cc9b849139c","a7e619b17d77d606f1d0d34720ef2516a24e664a","2f5ff7aa1f5dfbbc6c2ca936af1a5feef9da8f4d","df6d4575bae8a6bb4ee783859136a8d4a7ccc71f","f1a65d0a30a6ac706fa092afe1c324d1a97eb9c9","6badc07674ad33c83c6670c185f9127d7cdbadbd","d75cabe44b3c0cd73fcec344f97c1945dfbcae77","bd31e53e6889c7920a593ac0ef51805a75f35e55","30468a0e5930eb31c5eb02369f12001dccb3f2dd"],"title":"Variable selection for generalized canonical correlation analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu001"}

This broadens the scope of potential modelling approaches because response times can be analysed in addition to analysing the responses themselves. For this purpose, we present a new latent trait model for response times on tests. This model is based on the Cox proportional hazards model. According to this model, latent variables alter a baseline hazard function. Two different approaches to item parameter estimation are described: the first approach uses a variant of the Cox model for discrete time, whereas the second approach is based on a profile likelihood function. Properties of each estimator will be compared in a simulation study. Compared to the estimator for discrete time, the profile likelihood estimator is more efficient, that is, has smaller variance. Additionally, we show how the fit of the model can be evaluated and how the latent traits can be estimated. Finally, the applicability of the model to an empirical data set is demonstrated.","inCitations":["5000e554bc6771f20624069cc271800f0218533e","095d55ad16de19a5794daccd5d2c0e2535a52030","7787bc0822862c528192210ee6c071c753d9fd3d","f30715f0e875c6e3aaa91431414fec26d9e8ff75","2d30270cb820db9fa51bbbddd1cdb25d7cf71463","a9890953f61eb3a7ff45a513e4dc89a54d7fc83b","dbb83b274ed94c3094a14232b88ff66f4c805d54","7311c1482a7cdc5f27b3e2516729b825e360ef48"],"title":"A latent trait model for response times on tests employing the proportional hazards model.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02032.x"}

The main objective of this paper is to develop a two-stage adjusted exponentially tilted empirical likelihood (TAETEL) for the spatial analysis of neuroimaging data from longitudinal studies. The TAETEL method allows us to efficiently analyze longitudinal data without correctly modeling temporal correlation and to classify different time-dependent covariate types. To account for spatial dependence, the TAETEL method developed here specifically combines all the data in the neighborhood of each voxel (or pixel) on a 3 dimensional (3D) volume (or 2D surface) with appropriate weights to calculate adaptive parameter estimates and adaptive test statistics. Simulation studies are used to examine the finite sample performance of the adjusted exponential tilted likelihood ratio statistic and TAETEL. We demonstrate the application of our statistical methods to the detection of the difference in the morphological changes of the hippocampus across time between schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects in a longitudinal schizophrenia study.","inCitations":["bfc3789f6e4dc9983b8e5ad2211c5597ed64a5b2","d3e9789c7e8264f900af8aa94661e9bdf8ada89f","d0b2725038de9e4f96f1e14723aca9c2e8cd7272"],"title":"Two-stage Empirical Likelihood for Longitudinal Neuroimaging Data.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS480"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2009,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Computational statistics & data analysis","paperAbstract":"In many biomedical applications, researchers encounter semicontinuous data where data are either continuous or zero. When the data are collected over time the observations may be correlated. Analysis of this kind of longitudinal semicontinuous data is challenging due to the presence of strong skewness in the data. A flexible class of zero-inflated models in a longitudinal setting is developed. A Bayesian approach is used to analyze longitudinal data from an acupuncture clinical trial, in which the effects of active acupuncture, sham acupuncture and standard medical care is compared on chemotherapy-induced nausea in patients who were treated for advanced breast cancer. A spline model is introduced into the linear predictor of the model to explore the possibility of a nonlinear treatment effect. Possible serial correlation between successive observations is also accounted using the Brownian motion. Thus, the approach taken in this paper provides for a more flexible modeling framework and, with the use of WinBUGS, provides for a computationally simpler approach than direct maximum-likelihood. The Bayesian methodology is illustrated with the acupuncture clinical trial data.","inCitations":["a6bcb6781a9890f728cee96c7d621e784840beeb","1825ff33e8ea612cfe1e4deb168eb1ea957af79f","9cdae0567d11619811482cecfd27f4e61c974d89","8c33127b195d2b2c28a4f0f52e713cd04b9efe04","1f34c5ee588499c07911f1a25685804f380ba2ca","b622dfffdb15dd62a1be44dc001829a6cdcf0681","118207498b3f52a862f416c787208c943d77c979","1270773afc1ed8b2659ebf3932c7c140e7ed91f4","4c311e04b79643e3f923d36fe5c9a0bb2c4ac334","f8328e2a75b0f3cad1602b4fdfe0bfd9a7bfb4df","b6d585edfffbdadb9d77261335951f58f7b02a17","30bc76eeb931d8d9d45febb8924954ef37822232","ca627a3a21cefcb911b47adba7d895264ae88ae8","faf70947c948d80fc68e817a9d0a2f926b232a75","de6c15d070d23fd8ca09e735443fcbda0b5c262b"],"title":"A Bayesian analysis for longitudinal semicontinuous data with an application to an acupuncture clinical trial","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.09.011"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Multiplicities are ubiquitous. They threaten every inference in every aspect of life. Despite the focus in statistics on multiplicities, statisticians underestimate their importance. One reason is that the focus is on methodology for known multiplicities. Silent multiplicities are much more important and they are insidious. Both frequentists and Bayesians have important contributions to make regarding problems of multiplicities. But neither group has an inside track. Frequentists and Bayesians working together is a promising way of making inroads into this knotty set of problems. Two experiments with identical results may well lead to very different statistical conclusions. So we will never be able to use a software package with default settings to resolve all problems of multiplicities. Every problem has unique aspects. And all problems require understanding the substantive area of application.","inCitations":["2282966cee62cb32324c663ca016d76515dfdbef","4bf27c5b2b104dfef773e6860739aef35524e6bc","6299d701043bb63f7253647c6021d22a8a8f1c00","52a4d2444d00b75999c34f2b96e04f7fa71df03c","a64fb3a2f1b03f027157095e38fb9304499ca81e","322e87fc9b875cdb7a65af149722bc1134b5ab81","3d9b385913f9d470e175051fc113eb2b8dc5981b","5bc93b79ceeb872122c5129e9ebdf104aa516987","df33f2bcea274544dba47536b53cba8aa0fbd279","e7811c716b135d00fa1659b7a0be40a5a5dc9983","416ba38cdcdbc902e50684cda952a953552299a0","f1a76cbd7a9520867f4e347b09973a01aa9bd751","86c3b1fdee4ef2a3bf5c42a18f9130e5cab6646c"],"title":"The difficult and ubiquitous problems of multiplicities.","doi":"10.1002/pst.303"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"The simplicity and flexibility of Markov models make them appealing for investigations of the acquisition of HIV drug-resistance mutations, whose presence can define specific Markov states. Because the exact time of acquiring a mutation is not observed during clinical research studies on HIV infection, it is important that methods for fitting such models accommodate interval-censored transition times. Furthermore, many such studies include patients with extensive treatment experience prior to the onset of the studies. Therefore, the virus in these patients may have already acquired resistance mutations by study entry. Retrospective data regarding the time on treatment, which is often known or known with error, provide information about the acquisition rates before the start of a study. Finally, variability in the genetic sequences of circulating HIV creates uncertainty in the Markov states. This paper considers approaches to fitting Markov models to data with interval-censored transition times when the time origin and the Markov states are known with error. The methods were applied to AIDS Clinical Trial Group protocol 398, a randomized comparison of mono- versus dual-protease inhibitor use in heavily pretreated patients. We found that the estimated rates of acquiring certain classes of mutations depended on the presence of others, and that the precision of these estimates can be considerably improved by inclusion of retrospective data.","inCitations":["d92b5af650199b3706af67baf5bfd1d10612d561","ed7f6d0639230acf0ef8f485b7bc87daa2c77d03","879f671a608474be5f0e9d053e1bbae84f731a55","f08059961e1b7f41b7237150098b935725dbd106","2fc32415e653907cffdc9231ae7eb6b620b6ffa6","a0f0fbe522e646f6136b3d31b2ab689f9513e2a2","3323be6d74ed881e4c0b76d33bd0a47c1ae5c91d","5307c2df6f0b11b38fe2d28fe7bb45db35461d9b","b2caa13c36c7d1b39dc874af22e0d67dc1858712","c1f82cbdf5a76ea63d08090ea0d08b6df5aa13c0","916f6ebd3da9a803896e04c55e7e2dbf34ae599c"],"title":"Hidden Markov models for settings with interval-censored transition times and uncertain time origin: application to HIV genetic analyses.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl021"}

Each population is analyzed using each of the four procedures for linear dose-response effect for each tumor separately and for all animals with tumors.

A haplotype is a specific sequence of nucleotides on the same chromosome of an individual and can only be measured indirectly through the genotype. We consider cohort studies which collect genotype data on a subset of cohort members through case-cohort or nested case-control sampling. We formulate the effects of haplotypes and possibly time-varying environmental variables on the age of onset through a broad class of semiparametric regression models. We construct appropriate nonparametric likelihoods, which involve both finite- and infinite-dimensional parameters. The corresponding nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators are shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal, and asymptotically efficient. Consistent variance-covariance estimators are provided, and efficient and reliable numerical algorithms are developed. Simulation studies demonstrate that the asymptotic approximations are accurate in practical settings and that case-cohort and nested case-control designs are highly cost-effective. An application to a major cardiovascular study is provided.","inCitations":["03f903dc2bc892044784272011eb69d116be55b1","58ed973a22f37b87966e69804cde3b1958486345","6e881223b13059c31cd5093a5183ba9234399e5b","3229fce97889ea069d8f353b856f6cacf8ad2b99","db3699cec469d16897f0abfbda62ff8fb889b5dc","e1147507aecbc4851f37a175149543800d7c0743","db249a74eb983f3a56e1297ac2ba3424fd84f621","0ccac5c9e770dc54e5d9179c1fcf571119d28af2","b798e49b92111036d76fafe8dc01350f9448f81b","8dc2fa313beb4e854dde3fad8a3b832fd75c2dab","bdf132a24cfe6212ff3e9bd69f7a787ab846a6a2","891270f6414d62a7f33b1e694cbbb876b857f82f","57f4ef21a41488e0ed9f20927f2b6382110fd094","6c82ff50c4a359219b7eff43835bf3720e1a26a0","3838b534d4af8fb0ba5a938a035aef520cd8d712","0f75f914b57f0d5363fa9d07b5379adc56802dd1","a9d3e08cd3a3c721607fc96c50bcf605a2b3c31c","c947df1d5f1fb04bd058a7b0af777240cc2275d0","84879451d381cc77f98f2e96bdec84fe1350baaa","46f620bb995d0f3113ae8b1f628be09a7539ea68","6dcc5552e18ec3111c9af1247d9b66a3585824e4","9159d2aa0e2fc730157e6d1e6243d202af36433d","61f791da2488e9e24745fff79f58b1fad804c4e6","35cf71450211dca69cf0d3f787f5854787baefae","c7d3dd6b84410d24c81ba52852384a3c4a78fedf","10009870013078650784b5026a778916b54cb9ff","b0c9d1fbd55a979037a0028b46953318a832aa4c","0fd1157f0cb4662975c78ae8f509610694e45293"],"title":"Efficient semiparametric estimation of haplotype-disease associations in case-cohort and nested case-control studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj021"}

To model the hysteresis, one approach is to combine an effect compartment with an instantaneous exposure-response model. The combined model may not be easy to fit when the exposure-response model contains random effects. Therefore, it is sometimes useful to test existence of the hysteresis without fitting the model with an effect compartment. Although the likelihood ratio test and Wald test can be implemented based on a fitted model, they do not solve problems in fitting the combined model such as nonconvergence. Fitting a model without the effect compartment is often much easier, as the model contains fewer parameters with random effects. We propose a novel yet simple test based on an instrumental model that only requires fitting an instantaneous exposure-response model. For a wide range of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models, this test can be implemented using commonly used software. The test can be used based on a parametric PK model or based on a nonparametric approach such as linear interpolation. The performance of the proposed test was compared with a test based on lagged covariate models and examined by a simulation study and illustrated by implementing it to an analysis of the relationship between drug concentration and QT interval in a cardiac safety trial.","inCitations":["7072cd774cf079bc43fcef81b6250546537954e1"],"title":"Test hysteresis in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship with mixed-effect models: an instrumental model approach.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.859149"}

Oftentimes, treatment effect, if present, is not constant over time. In such situations, imposing a parametric mean structure can be too complicated and/or restrictive. A more flexible approach is to model the mean using a semiparametric smooth function, estimated using, for example, penalized smoothing splines. We formulate a series of models exhibiting how the group-specific mean profiles could possibly differ. Once an appropriate model is chosen, interest lies in identifying specific time points where the groups differ. For this purpose, we propose the use of simultaneous confidence bands around the fitted models wherein the bands take into account within and between-subject variability, as well as variability arising from smoothing.","inCitations":["fc55fe46c437a0a980eba81d2872a3a7a309dbb5","115bfc35c5301a63565c14819abd7b8cf8b9d8f6","fc6173917c41606d72db284dc081540e945994f5","afad85d22b6a98934572d6da70c798421eb47c94","6b655c47df1d4e6f03de8faeb98aa7f75a94786c","f2739b977407db7ddfe95e39d2d59927865e1022","84bf59cbb336a10070d22fb9630d138d900ff692"],"title":"Application of semiparametric mixed models and simultaneous confidence bands in a cardiovascular safety experiment with longitudinal data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802368881"}

Analyzing data for multiple time-point treatments with a view toward optimal treatment regimes is of interest in many types of afflictions: HIV infection, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children, leukemia, prostate cancer, renal failure, and many others. Methods for analyzing data from SRCTs exist but they are either inefficient or suffer from the drawbacks of estimating equation methodology. We describe an estimation procedure, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), which has been fully developed and implemented in point treatment settings, including time to event outcomes, binary outcomes and continuous outcomes. Here we develop and implement TMLE in the SRCT setting. As in the former settings, the TMLE procedure is targeted toward a pre-specified parameter of the distribution of the observed data, and thereby achieves important bias reduction in estimation of that parameter. As with the so-called Augmented Inverse Probability of Censoring Weight (A-IPCW) estimator, TMLE is double-robust and locally efficient. We report simulation results corresponding to two data-generating distributions from a longitudinal data structure.","inCitations":["59e7551f5b6ffde5cc9f8f2e29bd3c6fae1f4155","24f75166865d1b581f9ef84e5db5db0b0d7cae07","ec05c514460c9c165365690d7cd0174dea98df90"],"title":"Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Dynamic Treatment Regimes in Sequentially Randomized Controlled Trials","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1406"}

Finally, a relationship to the simple BTL model is established. Let p(a, b) denote the probability that a is chosen when (a, b) is presented in a fixed order.

Initially, we consider three different covariance structures for the data, where between-treatment covariance of repeated measures is modelled respectively through random effects, random coefficients, and through a combination of random effects and random coefficients. In all three of those models, an unstructured covariance pattern is used to model within-treatment covariance. In a fourth model, proposed earlier in the literature, between-treatment covariance is modelled through random coefficients but the residuals are assumed to be independent identically distributed (i.i.d.). Finally, we consider a mixed model with saturated covariance structure. We investigate the precision and robustness of those models by fitting them to a large group of real data sets from thorough QT studies. Our findings suggest: (i) Point estimates of treatment contrasts from all five models are similar. (ii) The random coefficients model with i.i.d. residuals is not robust; the model potentially leads to both under- and overestimation of standard errors of treatment contrasts and therefore cannot be recommended for the analysis of conditional QT prolongation. (iii) The combined random effects/random coefficients model does not always converge; in the cases where it converges, its precision is generally inferior to the other models considered. (iv) Both the random effects and the random coefficients model are robust.

The goal is to minimize the expected number enrolled or expected duration, while preserving the appropriate power and Type I error rate.

In survival analysis on the other hand, we study processes that develop in continuous time. Therefore, Røysland (2011. A martingale approach to continuous-time marginal structural models. Bernoulli 17, 895-915) developed the continuous-time MSMs, along with continuous-time weights. The continuous-time weights are conceptually similar to the inverse probability weights that are used in discrete time MSMs. Here, we demonstrate that continuous-time MSMs may be used in practice. First, we briefly describe the causal model assumptions using counting process notation, and we suggest how causal effect estimates can be derived by calculating continuous-time weights. Then, we describe how additive hazard models can be used to find such effect estimates. Finally, we apply this strategy to compare medium to long-term differences between the two prostate cancer treatments radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy, using data from the Norwegian Cancer Registry. In contrast to the results of a naive analysis, we find that the marginal cumulative incidence of treatment failure is similar between the strategies, accounting for the competing risk of other death.","inCitations":["365b32943eba48c9a69266a2755e3714fec6fe67","104611747b093a31f3fea0a443513887b2b9ed0f","ff480ab04982fb4611ee8791ef91225e8538e8d0"],"title":"Causal inference in continuous time: an example on prostate cancer therapy.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy036"}

These are short RNA sequences that can down-regulate the levels of mRNAs or proteins in animals and plants. Genes regulated by miRNAs are called targets. Typically, methods for target prediction are based solely on sequence data and on the structure information. In this paper we propose a Bayesian graphical modeling approach that infers the miRNA regulatory network by integrating expression levels of miRNAs with their potential mRNA targets and, via the prior probability model, with their sequence/structure information. We use a directed graphical model with a particular structure adapted to our data based on biological considerations. We then achieve network inference using stochastic search methods for variable selection that allow us to explore the huge model space via MCMC. A time-dependent coefficients model is also implemented. We consider experimental data from a study on a very well-known developmental toxicant causing neural tube defects, hyperthermia. Some of the pairs of target gene and miRNA we identify seem very plausible and warrant future investigation. Our proposed method is general and can be easily applied to other types of network inference by integrating multiple data sources.","inCitations":["6f6340f3f645d97ce8f8c2d1a9042cd7d0e63099","297c59104f0bb8652036f7a3eea5de93c5fb7fe8","293797700c5626d37f6506d7f94fb03576f61b21","4952510c2345e301e48901c0d14b8aa34c0a7e01","7873f40150674f7ba98bebf5db0b77d31ae270b4","7dad382160308e0821143715302671ce5522cf66","a2af6b6ab5076040757302294c30dcb1662e3164","38d9784ce686823b4e0057d3921962d0fdee7c90","75aacd42a365d4073038c8c022a780831a24b77c","986266472fe1625cc81e9b8b605415e7d1a79013","48ed1425c65bd5a546945d986fa6703f517d3dd1","5c4d22358fed8ec2cb7cc1c92ea913e92795f68b","07921c5aea3d61461418d2bcc538043faf224b39","9f0147076fc1b46f2d88a20c357da420f55224f0","01c9b856c26faa0b962f02adb1475f425f96ca9a","79e881384a26f9ecc3d27d79730dabdab8f67f59","1e2f1f01b42edfc6db37fca8f701fbf479351581","e4faa6097fbb2f027de6c9b839b92accdc34b919","3a7036177e16c00e242b24f08c196cd0870d86a6","024cc618048695026fe873d7e6df46e8e9816d8f","90eee27053407bd44a5ce489644c9445c03cc788","21d5f2d8dac3df5e2944cb610a720e7a0fcd52ff","d1409aef633ad4a2e3f555544d3a8fc59f4f2c43","a94204d5a1e93f8769982edba17634a594c728c8","a576c16abf7bfa46669b5183ed461872b9449313","976bffe77a789d3d8dcc4e332775ba9d779e8876","8ffad982f086a47df275aaac4a0de70fdcb29cb9","643605d3cb9badffd7a1d41a57de8d3acd2eeb44","a2aa9e803e0847b7c5709869c5b98667d94ab1f8","a57d532079d1b90a10be0f4af219919f7b3e88c5","a4a2b43be7153c0f917d413609f1e85a9f7be842","87e7dd7ade62396a883477d2eca7ac98e5b5a670","8981f92deafc9068a1cf643fb69ed48834365598","ec814529525cf41678ef0e23d8fa47effca02f5b","7b870873d61c17a6f0d768ff16d146a6721c7b86","43b74470dd5bc06f763e770d82840ebec022df99","d1e4fc5db13dc047fc7e3c7c058524f027eea1dc","053bda3307a36adec7d6050b5ccb97fe0ddabd17","585bb6c9f4acb311848f24cd7151f59d8ac458dc","5926c877b8ad271203ee2cbeb40b4bd29d570051"],"title":"A Bayesian Graphical Modeling Approach to Microrna Regulatory Network Inference.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS360"}

By definition, ROC curve is monotone increasing from 0 to 1 and is invariant to any monotone transformation of test results. And it is often a curve with certain level of smoothness when test results from the diseased and non-diseased subjects follow continuous distributions. Most existing ROC curve estimation methods do not guarantee all of these properties. One of the exceptions is Du and Tang (2009) which applies certain monotone spline regression procedure to empirical ROC estimates. However, their method does not consider the inherent correlations between empirical ROC estimates. This makes the derivation of the asymptotic properties very difficult. In this paper we propose a penalized weighted least square estimation method, which incorporates the covariance between empirical ROC estimates as a weight matrix. The resulting estimator satisfies all the aforementioned properties, and we show that it is also consistent. Then a resampling approach is used to extend our method for comparisons of two or more diagnostic tests. Our simulations show a significantly improved performance over the existing method, especially for steep ROC curves. We then apply the proposed method to a cancer diagnostic study that compares several newly developed diagnostic biomarkers to a traditional one.","inCitations":["149bfecbbc59e6f365e3eaa0cb7322f49fee82d1","91cbabf91eed614fda411b95c503e2c69e368a7a","c1b48564abd24bf3c295babbd01e4388ceb28d76","92fe33bd6e5363dd14bc663e52efc814ce4a25de","7409dd9f79ec3e675c7573119f8a47bc2f50316d","ffafe85329f79cf7c819651608f497b2e95a7d78"],"title":"Compare diagnostic tests using transformation-invariant smoothed ROC curves().","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2010.05.026"}

Use of assurance-that is, expected success probability averaged over a prior probability distribution for the treatment effect-to quantify PoS of a planned study has grown across the industry in recent years, and has now become routine within the authors' company. In this paper, we illustrate some of the benefits of systematically adopting assurance as a quantitative framework to support decision making in drug development through several case-studies where evaluation of assurance has proved impactful in terms of trial design and in supporting governance-board reviews of project proposals. In addition, we describe specific features of how the assurance framework has been implemented within our company, highlighting the critical role that prior elicitation plays in this process, and illustrating how the overall assurance calculation may be decomposed into a sequence of conditional PoS estimates which can provide greater insight into how and when different development options are able to discharge risk.","inCitations":["0368802af7cd6e24a24eb1764760b92b40211761","2e5d0547c61286075560d979985ecf50d3e7bce2"],"title":"Practical experiences of adopting assurance as a quantitative framework to support decision making in drug development.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1856"}
