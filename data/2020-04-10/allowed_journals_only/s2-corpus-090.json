It offers some insight on the underlying regression model for a given application. Moreover, it helps to provide deep understanding of various regression techniques. Despite the useful framework, however, the current development on continuum regression is only for linear regression. In many applications, nonlinear regression is necessary. The extension of continuum regression from linear models to nonlinear models using kernel learning is considered. The proposed kernel continuum regression technique is quite general and can handle very flexible regression model estimation. An efficient algorithm is developed for fast implementation. Numerical examples have demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed technique.","inCitations":["0a165294eb83f212fb27b6a1b887e162d3e116a9","bdd250ef9dc51f2227b93de65f2b78b4b982b14f","50f591cec5e621ffe125db1d01f54616deefb604"],"title":"Kernel continuum regression","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2013.06.016"}

One member of this class of models is the Poisson counter model, in which evidence accrues in unit increments and the waiting time between increments is exponentially distributed. This paper generalizes the counter model to allow the Poisson event rate to vary with time. General expressions are obtained for the RT distributions for the two- and the m-alternative cases. Closed-form expressions are obtained for response probabilities under a proportional-rates assumption and for mean RT under conditions in which the integrated event rate increases as an arbitrary power of time. An application in the area of early vision is described, in which the Poisson event rates are proportional to the outputs of sustained and transient channels.","inCitations":["e998913913dee9b2cbfc30d054dd4a144a9baf5a","7dd47ecc9752b752eb640e580f7ce01be15f7adc","7c28e9fa5f3a5b49d05e0c538b0dc8159f5e6b50","0da9b29097db59089444eaa2fed81be13bf406f2","5cb037b96c35c20fbe228bb36c468004d0031013","9e99829ef66f8ff9d794bf05a3c99664a043635e","b0b382c65962d81f92ec113523e417b2fdd67665","deddf858933aeea97b2513a729758373ef36c50e","f090c4b67b920e58ce8838a32d73d68098bfbb51","fa0d428da9a38350e50d3b11e6610522ac366544","bbdd99468b296c3be48601628ea164411a8b8c75","b629ba6479fb730567ad279a590906d22d069bcd","f101f28db88514dfdb86bbf63da6be0241ff3bd9","88f203f5f0826afc1b2125d587de02d561b660b7","b2f478938902243f5131e4e71329d06bf5d40078","264ebf25218ff8784c981db0918b18da5fac96ba","c04c0cab14122ba24cf9ef11497ead5287a78f9d","399d1aa83eb22b852bf986df362a5e06ed14a930","beb873a7ce921fbadd806f047c4d1e9a65c92929","3d620e94797ae6851b7ce59c7e7ca02da3771765","c6ff6df8bdcba5e036466367740b5489cafb2265","85da3873caba110f52d6f7e48c3d90966f865856","b56bfab75bab4fe08f92842f9ee04cfa02adbb2b","0066e817a4a3b56a54b2821987a2fa3da472fd5f","aecd83e983de289932ba310beaeb8d59a9abdd79","14b34129e44ca7aa5ddaa7df67f8228e5e2419fa","5fc529e09ef1f86fc78d2938e380e0634e7c8cc6","a1eacd89d6f4506e92af39e857a27db78b30ab64","61e626469eeff9c70ea4ccc3308c0183593e90d6","16d70e612fa8a5a7571cc83685fb8811a050f656","f3c05047b8f398461477c5d6a4d16102aedc7570","d33cefdfcd3ad3e2770c5d1f29770770644ea8ed","e6137dcc74821bcd74ca09c7c74a774867a5d898","2a527322b0f8add9c84aa04c9c00b78612ffd98f","1780235ded2702aa55c6e369a267d6d6e483d239","b26889f5b491c01db57d19ab863ea17424facf0c","71464586657391fb45d7afecddcb9441992f90f5","10608bcedf303ab6c535c01f526928d9350bafad","fd179dd27bb47552f9018633cd37d27c9c70d82b","77637445004916d54e630fcb2c279b50f961dcc3","532e3ac3ab506316b3e77bf602b3952af68a0448","2ff12434a75a08d99cbb6aa260ffbf1d84df2ad0","219b29111f9f4eb334756baf5eb220c111663b71","172bb6abc95f793e11c909a491e49b3b885be0c5","b8b6270ec55c52d0713ee94209807b8b63f8ef53","12d89d38e2f16d368f6fcbb469ec23a878ee8295","49c0f4689c059726e82705479cf2074909533c8e","6defeff30ef1f86d29baa15bb2d2a7b59ce6d46f","988c8dc09168958d5bc3e3edabeaa6d073281733","447a765b43a73a3f6a2ede0ed1c13a2a73d2bba5","f0e3719aa0048d6cec8083781f8ae98190fdb795","5429f9c1808dd2242b48e4327cb2aeebc5d658e7","4b974ee04f5952efafae73bf4ebe3836db4eba48","97a99ae11f539319adbee7cd2b86352cc047bf74","ba720d8eb9d178f0cd25b4a5097eeddb6331eaff"],"title":"Time-dependent Poisson counter models of response latency in simple judgment.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159349"}

The main purpose of this paper is to show that, in spite of his inadequate tools and concepts, Sir Godfrey Thomson's approach of 70 years ago was on the right lines. His thinking was constrained by the primitive state of his statistical understanding but it is illuminated by his substantial exchange of the correspondence with M. S. Bartlett in the 1930s, most of which has survived in the Godfrey Thomson archive at the University of Edinburgh. In order to justify our claim and clarify the issues, we have found it necessary to fill in some of the gaps in the original derivations of Spearman, Thomson and Bartlett and to express their work in terms which are intelligible today. The opportunity is taken to relate this earlier work to contemporary debates.","inCitations":["7d7cc1df8ca54decef5379e993eb3de6fb0428f7","d6fd146778e3fde53ca532d8c8b384fac52115c0","563a7f489f5750097d11d4a175d72eb2fda89371","7ed8bce520acef86e4ae33b3cdcfcf6ee26525ba","91bd14e30e7a85ebe07fbeaa029d2ddf53e2f9a5","7a459b8493629921e2b95d05c08836aa9cb56c09","5028fedfc499c3d683ad547f3f20c96eebe75b6a","9e4a7b00dd634a5ab47f0bfc330e3afb0bbbb236","ad2264cdd972b881b679e8599f1e60c477f59945","cf52224ea04c849ebe8604f0a81918e8840db71c","5541328fccb44fe54fc88630eb044582d66504e6","79fae0b4fe8393fc4eaf06888aea06ab9a231db7","9449894bd1a457fa2182dd012764b4e8bf7fad24","74737906a017abccfca0f0ab549e3fd047218443","6f90af0aa293ecb35959ef7e65eed35200bc97b0","53756d88b6562419da053bc5b613a811bb2e4d48","78564752e0ec4962bd7d17c2e238a1989baa397c"],"title":"The origin of factor scores: Spearman, Thomson and Bartlett.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X365676"}

In this situation, statistical methods that ignore competing risks can result in biased inference regarding the event of interest. We review the mechanisms that lead to bias and describe several statistical methods that have been proposed to avoid bias by formally accounting for competing risks in the analyses of the event of interest. Through simulation, we illustrate that Gray's test should be used in lieu of the logrank test for nonparametric hypothesis testing. We also compare the two most popular models for semiparametric modelling: the cause-specific hazards (CSH) model and Fine-Gray (F-G) model. We explain how to interpret estimates obtained from each model and identify conditions under which the estimates of the hazard ratio and subhazard ratio differ numerically. Finally, we evaluate several model diagnostic methods with respect to their sensitivity to detect lack of fit when the CSH model holds, but the F-G model is misspecified and vice versa. Our results illustrate that adequacy of model fit can strongly impact the validity of statistical inference. We recommend analysts incorporate a model diagnostic procedure and contingency to explore other appropriate models when designing trials in which competing risks are anticipated.","inCitations":["c80555f3b1c39a3919028d72eb08e28c38aae072","e0ec7a79e5897625cb31a8da09a08257c75c5cd2"],"title":"Planning and analyzing clinical trials with competing risks: Recommendations for choosing appropriate statistical methodology.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1966"}

We consider how to choose linear combinations of markers in order to optimize diagnostic accuracy. The accuracy index to be maximized is the area or partial area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We propose a distribution-free rank-based approach for optimizing the area under the ROC curve and compare it with logistic regression and with classic linear discriminant analysis (LDA). It has been shown that the latter method optimizes the area under the ROC curve when test results have a multivariate normal distribution for diseased and non-diseased populations. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed non-parametric method is efficient when data are multivariate normal.The distribution-free method is generalized to a smooth distribution-free approach to: (i) accommodate some reasonable smoothness assumptions; (ii) incorporate covariate effects; and (iii) yield optimized partial areas under the ROC curve. This latter feature is particularly important since it allows one to focus on a region of the ROC curve which is of most relevance to clinical practice.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2006,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"A general framework for the exploratory component analysis of multilevel data (MLCA) is proposed. In this framework, a separate component model is specified for each group of objects at a certain level. The similarities between the groups of objects at a given level can be expressed by imposing constraints on component models of the groups using the approach adopted in simultaneous component analysis. The constraints used are based on the loading matrices and on the covariances of the component scores of each group. MLCA is related to three-way component analysis and to currently available multilevel structural equation models. It is shown that the latter are less flexible than MLCA. The use of MLCA is illustrated by means of an empirical example.","inCitations":["ff0e34f8b6cb56b717474233e7b53c10c0421cff","c4df197b5ab20baf538a7c63faa68948de20c55d","65ce7d1f121d52f3138866a32999a2679ec8462d","3de0e80837eb30963a5d008b4a7767b13a343a05","18d8681edd8e6b2fcfbce9b636086ba78b2d63e9","f1b450554a97643a4e2a5b1df1019c6a3b99a6f6","01130ff65bb8f7636c52e71da0aa941241fc6c8e","242c527f06f975715f68826c7b6fd1d1b5c31fbf","f42686bbcae5d617e3fd97d95404e2109d8c1e1a","716389183827656d2b1e9f9e7ffd9b335cb5e605","029ec4a165fc68e5b8edfcd15002ceec2f7f7c04","23d20886fd2e63e96231fc1a16e22f07912a2220","29f399ebcb314c7bb801c43a86b1590f0acefe89","484784f14cf341b3cfe296abb6bcaf71260bff95","e473beec0a8426cc4b270c02f05a4622983672a3","267993a133bb14a7848d670dd878dbe70f26abfa","e39a06ef08b19dda5f80f15844e9d705986b872b","d6fed0803ca4961d853b2c14b3bce1d23d7a9701","3f59e1b50f8714c6f572d728f86f96979d53195b","90b31fc65886a2d05d90e7a8e4dd77fcbeccf49c","faabc08107d9987f6ba649a5d2ee6e6ca1d85ca7","703d7f9b32033315e22098474ce47f90c7d7bad3","452c9130dbf7aa0ffd7399fda5907ba4109f2723","c6eff72a13077e281b7e234d6b8afda2c5439859","93717fdf3bab3723ca14acb3f8c8a42f110fb33d","4ee8fcf5cb78d1a88ed27154f30c4ef2325a0ae8","7f068cf7cbf0d428a0c017a3e4775fcb9c49d206","8e84b89a1e3f53c16061611b3c143a3a88918651","ca75e67a88e7b53e2347c7298a942aa9d8a23705","9decff2091f1cb8435a36aa26df2a097b70bec1b","a9a653b2032caede050c4d3ab8f0c0a9011e7fcc","02c0381ea1699f62fd767bb0fad6cbda4743e626","822415fc6722290e4bfa3dafa69f3dd4ccbd865c","086bd24e4aa16fe0468173d6363e3a73ad6abe83","a5ca6476a33898a9aa026ab546acfbe13694ca4b","8f1a1cf352319b3dace914ef275dea66fb6506d0","93d179ea8870272130479efb3fd0731b9dfee2c8","8051d0726aa8413a4fbbbc540cf7693a10b2b568","af30e00d9e7e45898af44833955dca3bf94cf26f","53b7726f33a6a3790ba01d1b3cda8c6ae3a8a29c"],"title":"Multilevel component analysis.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X67599"}

In contrast with traditional phase I trials that are designed solely to find the maximum tolerated dose of the agent, our design instead identifies a maximum tolerated schedule that includes a maximum tolerated dose as well as a vector of recommended administration times. Our model is based on a non-mixture cure model that constrains the probability of dose limiting toxicity for all patients to increase monotonically with both dose and the number of administrations received. We assume a specific parametric hazard function for each administration and compute the total hazard of dose limiting toxicity for a schedule as a sum of individual administration hazards. Throughout a variety of settings motivated by an actual study in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients, we demonstrate that our approach has excellent operating characteristics and performs as well as the only other currently published design for schedule finding studies. We also present arguments for the preference of our non-mixture cure model over the existing model.","inCitations":["c588e7579b46854359aa23b63e8900a5c09ddd90","6c335236c661dbbae7123fc297d1f81dd7cfaa13","80fdd98fd9c4440e4ffa144d33129d59fc6c5d72","c50833f2a763f0ea20299f853e36e1247bb30b26","d1404a25d87c77cda80351ddbde6a16fdeef950c"],"title":"Parametric non-mixture cure models for schedule finding of therapeutic agents.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00660.x"}

This paper develops a statistical measure of the heterogeneity of a tissue characteristic that is based on the deviation of the distribution of the tissue characteristic from a unimodal elliptically contoured spatial pattern. An efficient algorithm is developed for computation of the measure based on volumetric region of interest data. The technique is illustrated by application to data from PET imaging studies of fluorodeoxyglucose utilization in human sarcomas. A set of 74 sarcoma patients (with five-year follow-up survival information) were evaluated for heterogeneity as well as a number of other potential prognostic indicators of survival. A Cox proportional hazards analysis of these data shows that the degree of heterogeneity of the sarcoma is the major risk factor associated with patient death. Some theory is developed to analyze the asymptotic statistical behavior of the heterogeneity estimator.

To accelerate the development process and shorten approval time, the design of multi-regional clinical trials (MRCTs) incorporates subjects from many countries/regions around the world under the same protocol. After showing the overall efficacy of a drug in a global trial, one can also simultaneously evaluate the possibility of applying the overall trial results to all regions and subsequently support drug registration in each region. However, most of the recent approaches developed for the design and evaluation of MRCTs focus on establishing criteria to examine whether the overall results from the MRCT can be applied to a specific region. In this paper, we use the consistency criterion of Method 1 from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) guidance to assess whether the overall results from the MRCT can be applied to all regions. Sample size determination for the MRCT is also provided to take all the consistency criteria from each individual region into account. Numerical examples are given to illustrate applications of the proposed approach.","inCitations":["cc738e36bd4663b0b2d794147f2d99b3f4accb85","a146dad1cf294f3445f4f400bd251e22512a42e5","f9aa37f7b6c052dbb872ed36d9b5e4c2c1a35f5b","b12dc3f2ba8fa678e9096d87df132e4562cfeadc","6ea0386a2e635cac2f5b2e0015047cc809c0b47c","f2d50a09e063f9de6ca2b1e1c45fb17e5ce3d8a4","500653e6a559079a5aa52883f3532562be77b66d"],"title":"Establishing consistency across all regions in a multi-regional clinical trial.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1512"}

In such data, the intervals are specified by a planned set of follow-up times. As the collection of panel data results in a partial loss of information relative to a record of the actual event times, it is important to gain a thorough understanding of the impact of panel study designs on the efficiency of the estimates of treatment effects and covariates. This understanding can then be used as a base from which to formulate appropriate designs by layering in other concerns, e.g. clinical constraints, or other practical considerations. We compare the efficiency of the analysis of panel data with respect to the analysis of data recorded precisely as times of recurrences, and articulate conditions for efficient panel designs where the focus is on estimation of a treatment effect when adjusting for other covariates. We build from the efficiency comparisons to optimize the design of panel follow-up times. We model the recurrent intensity through the common proportional intensity framework, with the treatment effect modeled flexibly as piecewise constant over panels, or groups of panels. We provide some important considerations for the design of efficient panel studies, and illustrate the methods through analysis of designs of studies of adenomas.","inCitations":["55de02ae5fd30815c750b5a08345659425a036b9","55d0ae6f8a9d66468878ee1ca2b31a7a3128d41d"],"title":"Efficient panel designs for longitudinal recurrent event studies recording panel counts.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt054"}

A new treatment or therapy is tested for a significant reduction of the incidence of the binary event compared with a control group. Another objective is to ensure that the incidence in the new treatment group is below some clinically acceptable value. This is done by calculating the exact upper 95% confidence limit for the probability of the event. The study is considered successful if the upper confidence limit is lower than a historical threshold, as well as if there is a significant reduction in the incidence of the event by the new treatment. In this article, we provide an exact method for calculating the sample size so that there will be adequate power to ensure that the exact upper confidence limit is below the threshold. Based on this we can design a study to achieve both objectives.","inCitations":["db6b332f09b6d986b8c78210dab37e645c5e4b9b","4ade1c48b24047d2e721fee79d528e7a9a6edcbe","e857e28c80024603ad8a3b5ca4e7ff0e4db6a98d","b33aec0b7dd07be5c3ac486de499b93211289e4f"],"title":"Sample size determination for controlling the upper confidence limit of incidence rate of a binomial endpoint.","doi":"10.1080/10543409808835254"}

However, the design of such trials have received relatively less attention from researchers. Zhang & Ahn (2012) derived a closed-form sample size formula for two-sample comparisons of time-averaged responses using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach, which takes into account different correlation structures and missing data patterns. In this paper, we extend the sample size formula to scenarios where K (≥3) treatments are compared simultaneously to detect time-averaged differences in treatment effect. A closed-form sample size formula based on the noncentral χ(2) test statistic is derived. We conduct simulation studies to assess the performance of the proposed sample size formula under various correlation structures from a damped exponential family, random and monotone missing patterns, and different observation probabilities. Simulation studies show that empirical powers and type I errors are close to their nominal levels. The proposed sample size formula is illustrated using a real clinical trial example.","inCitations":["7e5e4bcf209423829129e1ee2f09ee483481e995"],"title":"Sample size calculation for comparing time-averaged responses in k-group repeated-measurement studies","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2012.08.013"}
