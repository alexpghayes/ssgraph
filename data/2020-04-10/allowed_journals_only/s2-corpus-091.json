However, it is generally confined to the binary treatment assignment. In an extension to the settings of a multi-level treatment, Imbens proposed a generalized propensity score which is the conditional probability of receiving a particular level of the treatment given pre-treatment variables. The average TE can then be estimated by conditioning solely on the generalized PS under the assumption of weak unconfounded-ness. In the present work, we adopted this approach and conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of several methods using the generalized PS, including subclassification, matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and covariate adjustment. Compared with other methods, IPTW had the preferred overall performance. We then applied these methods to a retrospective cohort study of 228,876 pregnant women. The impact of the exposure to different types of the antidepressant medications (no exposure, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) only, non-SSRI only, and both) during pregnancy on several important infant outcomes (birth weight, gestation age, preterm labor, and respiratory distress) were assessed.","inCitations":["cb245f0df24d1f4a1fcb05009d0ee34a66f5d1b8"],"title":"Performance evaluation of propensity score methods for estimating average treatment effects with multi-level treatments.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2018.1523375"}

Although methods are available for making inference about Kendall's τ, none has been extended to modeling multiple Kendall's τs arising in longitudinal data analysis. Compounding this problem is the pervasive issue of missing data in such study designs. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to provide inference about Kendall's τ within a longitudinal study setting under both complete and missing data. The proposed approach is illustrated with simulated data and applied to an HIV prevention study.","inCitations":["4fbeec06d2b7849bfcdd158d92753648e11969d5"],"title":"On Inference for Kendall's τ within a Longitudinal Data Setting.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2012.712954"}

The sequential strong rules of Tibshirani, Bien, Hastie, Friedman, Taylor, Simon, and Tibshirani (2012) are also used in the algorithm and it is shown that these offer a considerable speed up over the standard coordinate descent algorithm with warm starts. Once implemented, the algorithm is used in simulation studies to compare the variable selection and prediction performance of the conditional logistic regression model against that of its unconditional (standard) counterpart. We find that the conditional model performs admirably on datasets drawn from a suitable conditional distribution, outperforming its unconditional counterpart at variable selection. The conditional model is also fit to a small real world dataset, demonstrating how we obtain regularization paths for the parameters of the model and how we apply cross validation for this method where natural unconditional prediction rules are hard to come by.","inCitations":["8963209b68bc27ebe9f0be41e5ecf7659b46aa42","7df86ad505d2de29e1b769acb00fe984254722c6","43330eb4948aed3c3d3f5b36ac80a5d82b6e1785","775a9730f374cc8f252da343a565da11dcc35ee0","bb2418c655b9c01e6abc493991a92dccc75436be","82349055ac661cb6ef5893a83194e436d2cf584d","454527b699660b7112350b321cfa5b19ed0c49ae","f31c70c8f31e12745a99d713928581db285831b1","473940526e0800d86c5b5555d0107073310c5ff2","b91dfbdda0bec4e0b2d528e35ed5267af334e6b2","8911e6510721e4cad60bc5e3d08365d4cb88f378","7563bdc756880683af0799902b765c34108265d5","ba8fc39c366030d62d0bd4767ce7bb28d79a65b0","44b45161498d9a1a2b2d3dcbc67eeeffe12b86e2","ca7e78d8001d83e235907c3b3db19ce3627e644b","ff26614708c369c00334b9a06c100ae72fd73b18","9f6282357b3951b74ca53e01db5340a401d3b38e","ec52707591b06f4bc906926a967a84eb4e2cb19b","43a252a0feec1c18aeda216ad3c1f23f9e98ba20","b9351c347fc7b0b67395e3f73ba47b4873fb977b","92d9586fe3a187b624f0d54f1dbd47307074c7ee"],"title":"Regularization Paths for Conditional Logistic Regression: The clogitL1 Package.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v058.i12"}

This paper presents mixed Markov models for ordinal data that take into account both sources of variation. In addition, covariates that may capture differences among panel members and time-specific changes are also incorporated in the model. The model is derived by specifying an observation-driven process at the individual level and allowing for parametric or semi-parametric representations of random parameter variation across the units of analysis. As a result, the approach is well suited for modelling ordinal panel data with a large number of time points. In an application a three-week diary study is analysed to test hypotheses about the relationships between emotions and personality factors over time.","inCitations":["be9783baa9dfe7589e6a3a35881e7dda4ca6d68c","9591873d82f2e54e38bb1330b19c97a398da33fc","a5198ba2eb32d9286adc658dfced7a272d28352b","e65a38f506f33a40e36c285c24b484a98a5f80ec"],"title":"Measuring change: mixed Markov models for ordinal panel data.","doi":"10.1348/000711099159008"}

We review recommendations on the choice of prior for Bayesian predictive power and explore its features as a function of the prior. The density of power values induced by a given prior is derived analytically and its shape characterized. We find that for a typical clinical trial scenario, this density has a u-shape very similar, but not equal, to a β-distribution.

On the basis of extensive empirical evidence of Type I error control and power performance, Welch's procedure is frequently recommended as the major alternative to the ANOVA F test under variance heterogeneity. To enhance its practical usefulness, this paper considers an important aspect of Welch's method in determining the sample size necessary to achieve a given power. Simulation studies are conducted to compare two approximate power functions of Welch's test for their accuracy in sample size calculations over a wide variety of model configurations with heteroscedastic structures. The numerical investigations show that Levy's (1978a) approach is clearly more accurate than the formula of Luh and Guo (2011) for the range of model specifications considered here. Accordingly, computer programs are provided to implement the technique recommended by Levy for power calculation and sample size determination within the context of the one-way heteroscedastic ANOVA model.","inCitations":["74a37c755c2cd4247d3e439be470d260e543d1e4","1474c1cd11b9e3c3e1302ae49ee6ff004385be80","20ea40269353f15a2bf3c417210df661fb4c6519","b50343c2723239bd46a3c512c112239899534d80","377d1d2c8db88c6bff59ef0077c7e5a3abd996b3","4d415fff8c2afef963edd88ea62e80c6922cece9","09e0181b07d4ed7ca385170cf379aa53ea0ee956","f0ce71aa8e62a1901177cb74503b24da5422f538","035851063b166c52baf78f73876fa023a7cff159","3d44852495cfea64855c6b43b992673e69561201","ad31dfaa9ae34b2134b7c503e4863ced5546945d","49a72bc295c0cc4157da8f94f288276cc26ff940","fe7c126d0f0b505cfd7c7cf626794fe75ce587e6","0bcaf9628bce211095f38e0a5b984736b29d3349","82e5b2ad7f571b1cfd3154115ee125b472b2b19f","35491ce71d398eae63d752b7cb497d5188025215","2304b8e6468706d5c9d2ac44fb0ffe70c18a692e","f33dfe6b16dc135844fafd02a2febd98c8402972","b9ae0aa9ec5c2bdc61cde74c8606ee561235f83f","05d59abe310d71b584203a9758280fa29de85e30","06d75d5a61e3d2302c015c2e0580e25c2b9d28b5","6f62ba9a901ca247bda68611172d6b137be73ac8","dbbc3baa4584dc7a99c0fa4a3d97ed1ab8e095a4"],"title":"Sample size determinations for Welch's test in one-way heteroscedastic ANOVA.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12006"}

Many multivariate regression techniques are designed for univariate response cases. For problems with multiple response variables available, one common approach is to apply the univariate response regression technique separately on each response variable. Although it is simple and popular, the univariate response approach ignores the joint information among response variables. In this paper, we propose three new methods for utilizing joint information among response variables. All methods are in a penalized likelihood framework with weighted L(1) regularization. The proposed methods provide sparse estimators of conditional inverse co-variance matrix of response vector given explanatory variables as well as sparse estimators of regression parameters. Our first approach is to estimate the regression coefficients with plug-in estimated inverse covariance matrices, and our second approach is to estimate the inverse covariance matrix with plug-in estimated regression parameters. Our third approach is to estimate both simultaneously. Asymptotic properties of these methods are explored. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed methods perform competitively in terms of prediction, variable selection, as well as inverse covariance matrix estimation.","inCitations":["a582202229003019b19067578eb63cb8b070fade","8a8fbd830a35421fb2c20df14cb0486650df4c55","db40507198da4daffa250387762e560cbff7325f","3917fb9c1fa786b4c1dc803668c9d399be30e8cf","35b84923a5f26eebe4a833158ea54fa25cbf85e1","cc5c26709a88e8e02a41942f4c6c5154c6095ba7","fbee4184153482bd1ca10eebde0e2e544ded2e5b","74ee98dfc8f6c725cb0dbcc83bb53beaedbb4ef4","daf23c9a461144509121430b9b2c162e9c04d5c5","aaf91bfd9eccfd0942ee8be9e5fa8d0627ea77ab","ddadfdc5bce82fcf5179038ddff6e2176d5ee84f","7b210e99bf34f41a6ec0960ac3b362fe0786d18c","7ac929f13976a257d7400a12e2bf7beebcbb8f7a","65ac8d5d0a8d17be0671f7375b9ad9a6052d6d8a","bc92aee1ef58cb108c0ab1da9d97c5b33ecaabd2","1c84c313fc4d7d37b591810c9ee95b20530db973","a25594ded5c73fc27bdf3dd1adccca353c9ad112","971afc8b75a7b52ab9e5b56814bc3bd55470bb3a","a4de78e0477efe057f44ef499f1439b697bccb2a","fc1e4e79739a3a930083a777268c03b06b5bda77","1a0013a21bbe1f88dce438357c5a266013fec514","c60a7e843e9195188579ab9616f8f5d5a28af859","c3e225b52fdf0dbcd55cf1801b8cc2c99ce82691","9738294f061b6680f0f8a0f44d7e25d182b3373c","d164a830ca0b765f59eeed46a9593d93f56babe2","00dac1e79762ca6900cd5e5b64ff40de3da6620f","517b000e20f3c646825cff23f922be19451dcede","1cbf9c54c826bd2af80dac26928c99ea017466ca","a13f15b97d1d35812c4347696fe764eb8631dd70","b15cdb5aed06bbaf5fbf245c5d62ec2733282985","8000be78ba378fb4233c9bd9b7e5cf4af352d5f3","2567fd50385a57540cf7a23a54af38bebbbb2fb6","dee0df7eeb591977d0d3cfed338a0d8e3d6e63f3","d686656d1ea1fbfe46ea0756978dbb524a4a37b9","81b899136e15843adafa49dd0aae512613c4d6b4","a9efac350ca4e267480b95157a71a13444c7fa06","3a60c4404b114a1de740dea728dee202849def02","20cc8b64867643ac9311028ec3bb7c4074c5eb28","333823edf673cfd4075238d8610cbf2cebb139ca","0954184fec94178ede74f616c3f318b7d38b4391","988f724ecb27ca278d708d0f313f9347da0c7a0d","b5a02f7207c05d6cd98b9c6db9619b7d16564513","c8ec539694a4502f6392ac30058fa8b8b9ab1994","053fe0da6d3cd31baa8b0c92204aa1cabb60d30b","26be8098ea674bf1351fcf81e2df106bdea50cd6"],"title":"Simultaneous multiple response regression and inverse covariance matrix estimation via penalized Gaussian maximum likelihood","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2012.03.013"}

Internal validation generally refers to validation procedures solely based on the study dataset. A popular approach to internal validation of identified genomic features has been the split-dataset validation. Contrast to this approach, internal validation in genome-wide association screening studies is precisely defined through the concepts of association profile and profile significance. A general procedure and two specific profile significance measures are developed and are compared with the split-dataset validation approach by a simulation study. The simulation results clearly demonstrate the strength and limitations of the profile significance approach to internal validation, especially its enormous gain in sensitivity (power) and stability over the split-dataset validation. The proposed methodology is illustrated by an example of genome-wide SNP associaiton analysis in genetic epidemiology.","inCitations":["469b8c63e79c7af074766131b24771d5a84630a6","ae076ec88a807373df145ddca8991dc82aeb2d99","2d89f3b2022cf3db41013d4d6050a32721626754","30164f63203a0805716c8fc70f65a24cbd32532e"],"title":"Internal validation inferences of significant genomic features in genome-wide screening","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.07.004"}

Over the 240 empirical values collected for each method investigated, in which we varied the total percentage of data trimmed, sample size, degree of variance heterogeneity, pairing of variances and group sizes, and population shape, one method resulted in exceptionally good control of Type I errors. However, under less extreme cases of non-normality and variance heterogeneity a number of methods exhibited reasonably good Type I error control. With regard to the power to detect non-null treatment effects, we found that the choice among the methods depended on the degree of non-normality and variance heterogeneity. Recommendations are offered.","inCitations":["c2322425dfa6a59d85ba254d5cb6cad35c3ca0f5","f9dc07026bc49b1b380c8f244b138628de181be1","0960367919869545d7d9d5d032b9642fc2ecf6b7","37536b34286909722bd5eed62bc25015f4927180","0c87ba0ebfc0dab4da53386460b9ac0d896475b0","2e9d66571d5377d46dc731899e9a68d92e80605f","be24cc38cf0346208d1015a780d7b3296183ab43","605985fd267f282d84c426b5b82bf22be1b3a734","8577ef76adbd3e52558ed3b7a8c264eaf96d9af9","e91c5a33a8af2bb9f630115715eb00cecc440de3","02a23e9e2d6f1dc6c7e42723cf6fdb629d8e74c9","e5cb6b5d6b46e888f707a1d2e965257ede73622e","ba6e351883dcb9ecbdbd0d7be04ca882ff26541d","ec8b251a6d403702a9b3bbb669b9e360c57c6969","96f7ac9168ecb4ab92c83afe1ddfce3b7ee1fdb5","285bdcaa68c49ac7f6cc6f224383c9a912110495","96860d85a8468b91a545db8019f139046cd9cd5f","5ed11064088b97d84cdb3efb4fe4eff0f2327766","5845fff6d7309750035414dc1eb8eb26d0f8c16d","961c83c690e7597a7c0fe069e3578184e063ded9"],"title":"Adaptive robust estimation and testing.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X63755"}

This model is appealing in its flexibility for modeling censored survival data. Current approaches for estimation of the regression parameters involve maximizing discontinuous objective functions, which are numerically infeasible to implement with multiple covariates. Based on the partial rank (PR) estimator (Khan and Tamer, 2004), we propose a smoothed PR estimator which maximizes a smooth approximation of the PR objective function. The estimator is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the PR estimator but is much easier to compute when there are multiple covariates. We further propose using the weighted bootstrap, which is more stable than the usual sandwich technique with smoothing parameters, for estimating the standard error. The estimator is evaluated via simulation studies and illustrated with the Veterans Administration lung cancer data set.","inCitations":["2dfdd0603cb7d6124827d80703dd6748d2c8344a","71fe86cfdf8ef5242a51164ecfb9536c4519e160","588a5fc3662d9101675f91ab994a8882dd2adb66","7c98cc8e73db51cb55e55001e3765455bf24830f","f010f6d55ec18f5236062c1fe21ebd7db961515b","43ef97ecc5068fb65862941500f3b3f020adb65b","18802fb10c19bcdcfa82eea83ee7308f75c38afe","52db4645a29f6852804e70e5f32a5a0d206a55b1","54d189b1f194e3853a06b4fa81ff7355ecb5d876","cd0eb6f58c03b8ae5b4fd67813f4e13e5b39925e","77479fb5f278920a2437bd2bef0fa4512d658e57","c6a0f20f44dfcfb136854d04d8fee94a7e562e8b","00e7a0b907f6fcc44faa3f2bc690e7f2a91799e7","84ee7ca1f740c7e14c8a7bb140eb14129a281bee","35b4b17519513faa87d8c03b8a671f9f1e2b6895","c2732965f883c99d45803377d0495787c6680ec3"],"title":"A semiparametric approach for the nonparametric transformation survival model with multiple covariates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl001"}

Much of the resulting literature on multiple comparisons has paid relatively little attention to the choice of test statistic. In this article, we focus on the issue of choice of test statistic based on a special pattern of differential expression. The approach here is based on recasting multiple-comparison procedures for assessing outlying expression values. A major complication is that the resulting p values are discrete; some theoretical properties of sequential testing procedures in this context are explored. We propose the use of q value estimation procedures in this setting.

This is a powerful technology which can play a major role in the study of biological processes, potentially leading to better understanding and treatment of disease. Dynamic PET data relate to complex spatiotemporal processes and its analysis poses significant challenges. In previous work, mixture models that expressed voxel-level PET time course data as a convex linear combination of a finite number of dominant time course characteristics (called sub-TACs) were introduced. This paper extends that mixture model formulation to allow for a weighted combination of scaled sub-TACs and also considers the imposition of local constraints in the number of sub-TACs that can be active at any one voxel. An adaptive 3D scaled segmentation algorithm is developed for model initialization. Increases in the weighted residual sums of squares is used to guide the choice of the number of segments and the number of sub-TACs in the final mixture model. The methodology is applied to five data sets from representative PET imaging studies. The methods are also applicable to other contexts in which dynamic image data are acquired. To illustrate this, data from an echo-planar magnetic resonance (MR) study of cerebral hemodynamics are considered. Our analysis shows little indication of departure from a locally constrained mixture model representation with at most two active components at any voxel. Thus, the primary sources of spatiotemporal variation in representative dynamic PET and MR imaging studies would appear to be accessible to a substantially simplified representation in terms of the generalized locally constrained mixture model introduced.","inCitations":["046d65d312cf3b33b74aab5db51b4046b4876562","bbc8cb34e3f374705c7b6d5b39a3a72c8d674324","5911ce9616fff91a1454b201e0c23103692b1858","2cdfb9fc36bb0515bb7c26080c288156d7062268","905bd7e2f757669247240ef7e2be1c2f5fa8f4dc","0a48e735dd220e730abef77bb6882a2be6e4bd11","f0d1d4759c3d9c5ac4d6be31dd7d9829e9d78399","9afad37b7f2a4ce9b70aaefd53ead8d895fd1534","68e9add32e62991fc4f52aea735419d504652a03","72a27a095face48bbb67aa76261a133cbe06c494","7cd727907bb535c0a68229604177251666b940c3","a23a2ff00b7a8fb8f50f229385ae808b6676ff8b","ef2ff2c8f9605a45700e5497fe7eaa7ef50d9033","a398766ad3865a048f32f58ef20bd3d113293e36","6e8693489455f81bc6c29891b8f3535eeca69f25","bc496ad04aeda75b92175ff3f00c2112a5eb087d","6cef245526afad38f9651105dd86785f28f2f268","e13dbe73cdee55a3e387373624b33128f9c9b600","306af7c58171be5266aedbe82684c5887f12bbc2"],"title":"Locally constrained mixture representation of dynamic imaging data from PET and MR studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj010"}
