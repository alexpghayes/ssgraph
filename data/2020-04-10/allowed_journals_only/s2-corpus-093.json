This restriction is shown to improve the mixing of the Markov chain Monte Carlo search to find an optimal model with little effect on the haplotype frequencies implied by the estimates. A further restriction requiring intervals to cover specified points is also considered and shown to be appropriate for modeling associations between alleles at genetic loci. As well as usefully describing the patterns of associations, these estimates can also be used to model population haplotype frequencies in statistical gene mapping methods such as linkage analysis and association studies.","inCitations":["3cd969067f5bfca701a84ab86145bc73069d739e","e864839aecbffe425d5b1a6e9a0212278470a439","73d8af9d229ae435a38458007a7387163e441c85","1e5f42189953002d2c0b759699f909710dfea8f7","7504a571281fa1b308a938469ea7b781bba205e4","aaeeb9ce3886eb7918b6c4ee47dab0f1585c244a","5587ffcceaa9488cccb7f4fd11b7e01c7fee3928","b043337bc6bddfa85cca3a8000326312ef614425","f1634af601779d936450d1147cff3335b3ce4ad0","e9ca219b383776d094b755eacdb8a10d42f5aa8f","2280b45cdf0e2acbca187bb69beb3bb47265cfdd","11157a1b086b1bb540826abdf75e2024c69a4de1","0dc685c816f13426a860c0696dc251400c42f6dd"],"title":"Estimation of graphical models whose conditional independence graphs are interval graphs and its application to modelling linkage disequilibrium","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.003"}

A conceptualization of the general problem of non-random sampling is proposed leading to a model of which both restriction of range and Berkson's Fallacy (Berkson, 1946) are special cases. Cast in the framework of unequal sampling probabilities operating separately on the variables of interest, two major forms of the model are investigated: an additive and an interactive (multiplicative) form. The influence of unequal selection probabilities on population values of the bivariate normal correlation (ρ) is described and findings from other research on restriction of range are shown to be special cases of these results.

If used as a crude screening device: significant at the 5% level, yes or no: do they broadly serve their purpose? Theidealwaytoanswerthequestionwouldbetotakeacollectionofconclusionsreported,somepositive and some negative, each with an associated p-value, and to see for each whether independent confirmation is reported within, say, a 5- or 10-year period. Have any such studies been done? The difficulties are clear. Note, though, that Webb and Houlston (2009), in a review of recent genetic association studies connected with breast cancer, remarked on the relative paucity pre-genome-wide association study of such confirmation. Significance tests have of course a long background of history and misunderstanding and can be used in a number of different ways. The oldest discussion of the study of a number of p-values concerns the quite different issue of combining them into a single value. The first discussion more in the spirit of the present paper is probably that of Schweder and Spjotvoll (1982), who studied carefully the left tail of the empirical distribution of p. There are additional complications in Jager and Leek’s context, arising, in particular, from the often heavily rounded values of the significance level reported. It is very unlikely that a different conclusion would have been reached by transforming p before analysis but some insight for graphical analysis might have been achieved by analyzing instead of p either � −1 (1 − p) or, probably better still, −log p ,t he latter possibly allowing comparison with the Renyi decomposition for order statistics of the exponential distribution. A much more central question concerns whether the qualitative conclusion drawn from the shape of the distributionof p,givenp <0.05,isjustified.IhavenocriticismofthediscussioninJagerandLeek’spaper but there may be alternative explanations of some of what is observed. One is that a certain proportion of the low p-values reported are based on a miscalculation of p, most plausibly not on a numerical error but, as is relatively easily done, by underestimating the internal uncertainties involved in some individual studies.","inCitations":["a6beda91090825037ba7b11646c6040c4d5c61cb","582f85f0248c1496ae067cdb6cf2b6f9f134d929","2cddbbdf1554b967f7c5a5d3cdbb9d62bf389f33","d6aeb5e464617dfc566c68e51d299318ba1a76de"],"title":"Discussion: Comment on a paper by Jager and Leek.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt033"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":1997,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In this paper we propose a two one-sided tests procedure for assessment of individual bioequivalence based on the concept of individual equivalence ratios proposed by Anderson and Hauck. The proposed procedure is derived under the normality assumption for the logarithmic transformation of pharmacokinetic responses obtained from a standard two-sequence, two-period crossover design. We show that the hypotheses for individual bioequivalence are equivalent to the hypotheses for testing whether the upper (or lower) pth quantile of the distribution of the differences between the test and reference formulations from the same subject is not greater (or not smaller) than some prespecified equivalence limits. Under this setting, we examine the relationship between average and individual bioequivalence. There exists the uniformly most powerful invariant test for each of the two one-sided hypotheses. In addition, the proposed two one-sided tests procedure is a test of size alpha (i.e., < or = alpha). We demonstrate that the determination of critical values, the enumeration of power, and the estimation of sample sizes requires noncentral t-distributions but does not necessarily require the estimation of unknown population mean and variance for noncentrality parameters. We discuss possible extensions to other crossover and replicated crossover designs. A numerical example illustrates the proposed procedure.","inCitations":["4fe1f95836d36cc4dec0b5777a9efa862073f80d","8043d6eba7b6812400a8704f9a500e274e38e1dc","996e9d87000948d46d3afc340681706da0211865","d01bb697b7faca53a372b07bf5c1ecb1389287bb","49d8715215aecfbb6e1d28e46b70e4723a543956","3e807b4e02a610c1ed0930fbc101131a05e7a14d"],"title":"A two one-sided tests procedure for assessment of individual bioequivalence.","doi":"10.1080/10543409708835169"}

For example, the goal might be to estimate the conditional mean of an outcome given a list of input variables. In this prediction context, bootstrap aggregating (bagging) has been introduced as a method to reduce the variance of a given estimator at little cost to bias. Bagging involves applying an estimator to multiple bootstrap samples, and averaging the result across bootstrap samples. In order to address the curse of dimensionality, a common practice has been to apply bagging to estimators which themselves use cross-validation, thereby using cross-validation within a bootstrap sample to select fine-tuning parameters trading off bias and variance of the bootstrap sample-specific candidate estimators. In this article we point out that in order to achieve the correct bias variance trade-off for the parameter of interest, one should apply the cross-validation selector externally to candidate bagged estimators indexed by these fine-tuning parameters. We use three simulations to compare the new cross-validated bagging method with bagging of cross-validated estimators and bagging of non-cross-validated estimators.","inCitations":["74a833a02c0da1a8727fa218019e72bc9b8219fa","a99b217a899115ecaa68bc66f87bd4c9136d88aa","9f2a9b4dd2c864f4ddf667443849498be22455a2","9e9326cb070024474079b707e848973ab1ec065c","41d4629fe150d6dda124b47fd209429cccef1ab3","a86014e2207073f132013e9817d57feffd9180ed","da06e36fa7b99ae3aa1e257ccd13e8d7f8e1d9c5"],"title":"Cross-Validated Bagged Learning.","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2007.07.004"}

We propose a semiparametric variance components model to describe phenotype observed at a time point as the sum of a nonparametric population mean function, a nonparametric random quantitative trait locus (QTL) effect, a shared environmental effect, a residual random polygenic effect and measurement error. One feature of the model is that we do not assume a parametric functional form of the age-dependent QTL effect, and we use penalized spline-based method to fit the model. We obtain nonparametric estimation of the QTL heritability defined as the ratio of the QTL variance to the total phenotypic variance.

Doing so ensures that the feature space has finite cardinality and enables us to exploit counting process theory and the uniform consistency of the Kaplan-Meier survival function.","inCitations":["f541631a89efece390bf07d3312e4d3cc19bc78a","cb33d7cfc7f82bcea1fec6d78fbc3e551f2042c4","a12e5a76dfa599de852f0424da9feac5bf6ba41f","13785104c99e9fa2ae239f33cdddee077da2fb5e","d17642a40f699c5c047516097f1bde6abca4b38f","668a44c62d8a327e4ce581592ebc09793d0e85ed","412cc208f66497066a51e519ad7db13397f03244","9cce45c950bd48328feb7767144a8d4a70fbd5a4","5e6d9c1acf11d8fe5e68c1a345aee8e96d880a7c","bc287c85b0068960c08ed09ea27265dad0f6c069","15e82c361f6a2467d91c7a9083e9721bc6b8086e","127cbcacda4bfa849c979d968b6c1af71ea1af7e","052c9d56254667497b69939eb776d713f2660f02","bddf65576d9305435fac4a1da2cb1ed017718abf","809fd0818308367e62cbe40e0f18e4f7516da98f","5c03a99c52eb96b685ffd7c9a2705082ff0ada15","0c22114e86f065592b3e9ca9c25e017bd379f23a","fa17bfb8fe987e8b7180f03ce680078bf6825652","4954170f3601a74a7b39fd930ee58b61f0b89361","502b55829af14831825e80d4e590e797f3cce8ff","b47d22d7ee02371b79ed269e18c5b4d0cb37a364","0749ffeca364519e25d9101c40dd68cf82ee8211","5e6c61f0fecaeb5acb1f837e18dde60a036fe4cf","2d65037cca21eb766e65affd2ddc84b8e383c217","b19bdba21183e5bd4671ecc43a90fc84b41e53ab","4a65b18b5628220cb1ffe57cc02a1da92524700b","c6142825f2b8b8dc6e05934dcf86fd971c83f355","19c02ff0c741fa528032b4eb357bb0d936692912","9c1664270dfbf70498d2c3f45aebeb5f057fb898","f40710ae9676b8e8897a515ba29e98244c69ac3a","0aac700144719c9bfd1625467df3783645d20d3d","e012c17b073adecfd4c37582a9233e7d1c3b770d","852c895d235ae7de6177e41339ff296ec974e0df","9131b527b0e8269b3b1554aecd356bab060c9b86","229c852396ba76ed491eb767b4b14242f2e75313","47968044d5f064889e33a9bf71108b14f8e072de","f09df6128ecdf2ca5df110a912980bd5aecc6059","b1d33d8be5ec3d8a4c39938ed5c45f9dd976c841","554d294dda05f2fa3b115ae6d71487d8a89f2ee7","da6af72069d401e1aa20152586667ca3cab4a537","01d366a93981f9bb9cf4ad144a00ee2af6bdea50","418c01434c035fc335088625dec7ab2597f2d6c4","1feef43a8852c1ead545cc4cf580f4b35b9881ec","3e9a1daf09d089dd365142291ac8e4d68d4afb6b","30b7ca8f023cc39300923d8c6f421156f5cd24d6","b1b77e86d5a297892add1ace6faf95bb31ace3db","cd76d348092d819bd5fe4379420182709f2f86a6","ba6019c69c9baadf3631750e0961b993833faee7","e67c18886a354695d11695893baa13fc0f44a5c3","b7ffa06b5a47b7a71c36557afe806993efe59d86","9123a0e89fc2873a3cabc0d9834cc2907591217c","eebc5f0855b9b8c5675377b4040243a3b0ae0b4b","a261366a0f38852f66b1b173265e46bbf3f65e81","d6be78fbaf9bdd97af6ccc521c9d37099c9fe2a9","6606bd4ee697ec80c9a58d867f093db4c37a2177","8fd951a78da50d76b8df2036c622f6d28bb882de","08fc2d7e3aefb7280fd516fbae0e7e28c876b304","155e2bd217a3b26ca3fa649f85fa90e33396abaf","c781bbcb9142f0e7caf85e027f68d4c7f3130294","f2e3693285c4e45e4db857b84364d3e795658a11","3a5af407c82f247f529ed86d91f255b5f78460c8","1cf1f51aee4035c12e8b8c41a738f371772eb418","d259606fe50d219e4f08a57f231b70a619bb3bc8","ebca277de485972c4684da5c9df808b26a8903c4","26f2b6a1748b7366899cd0b0f41cb83337f598bd","610fc14b900dedbdd790c065fcf1f3644e1e67fd","5d41b77f4430f40121dfa75765e651ff24a3e45c","98a7d80459e8fc6e22b789fb22be4de123b4a5ad","8366967cc4cd0c32348690c80d298d84020eed07","0a5e84eeb85c5b3799d567db3ae869dbfa4cb13b"],"title":"Consistency of Random Survival Forests.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2010.02.020"}

However, examinees may obtain test information from more than one examinee in practice. This larger scope of information sharing needs to be taken into account in refining exposure control procedures. To control item exposure and test overlap among a group of examinees larger than two, the relationship between the two indices needs to be identified first. The purpose of this paper is to analytically derive the relationships between item exposure rate and each of the two forms of test overlap, item sharing and item pooling, for fixed-length computerized adaptive tests. Item sharing is defined as the number of common items shared by all examinees in a group, while item pooling is the number of overlapping items that an examinee has with a group of examinees. The accuracy of the derived relationships was verified using numerical examples. The relationships derived will lay the foundation for future development of procedures to simultaneously control item exposure and item sharing or item pooling among a group of examinees larger than two.","inCitations":["f4343ad97521a5513487796c3860fe8413378ba8","bec8116b8cbac6fe6958234af3ae864b2328647d"],"title":"Investigating the relationship between item exposure and test overlap: item sharing and item pooling.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X430906"}

Observers could alternatively be instructed to use a 'guess' key on those trials, a key that would produce a random guess and would also record the resultant correct or wrong response as emanating from a computer-generated guess. A simulation study shows that 'denoising' 2AFC data with information regarding which responses are a result of guesses yields estimates of detection threshold and spread of the psychometric function that are far more precise than those obtained in the absence of this information, and parallel the precision of estimates obtained with yes-no tasks running for the same number of trials. Simulations also show that partial compliance with the instructions to use the 'guess' key reduces the quality of the estimates, which nevertheless continue to be more precise than those obtained from conventional 2AFC data if the observers are still moderately compliant. An empirical study testing the validity of simulation results showed that denoised 2AFC estimates of spread were clearly superior to conventional 2AFC estimates and similar to yes-no estimates, but variations in threshold across observers and across sessions hid the benefits of denoising for threshold estimation. The empirical study also proved the feasibility of using a 'guess' key in addition to the conventional response keys defined in 2AFC tasks.","inCitations":["adb5c13fb827d0b98598d833073e9610c8c84cae","240bdef0e4d8ca10dcc8b20aedbf249d953eb7cf","2579b9136bf19616553e0e984abc95aa43363f4c","35cf246cd6d8fac386a0887bcde0bc7f36bc7bf3","c9ccabbdcb2ad3b912a58a35d0cad90929d2f501","92439fb02f317398eb2d1021a12cc23b407914ba","b5e9ded5738767739ac69a0e9c9c4aba22bff6e7","39939a0598ab5dd09ac37925917c22b7501318db","a926e67e0802d6be702dcd4253aedd21220d0b46","2a5837c5ae8d94052295de5df86825cbdef46691","45ab6987d430e341e4ac73263bd163b46a22ac6a","531535f853a6ddc05cb532d050d9171e2d20301c"],"title":"Denoising forced-choice detection data.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X424057"}

However, other genomic data involved in the mechanism from SNPs to disease, e.g., gene expressions, are usually neglected in these association studies. In this paper, we propose to exploit gene expression information to more powerfully test the association between SNPs and diseases by jointly modeling the relations among SNPs, gene expressions and diseases. We propose a variance component test for the total effect of SNPs and a gene expression on disease risk. We cast the test within the causal mediation analysis framework with the gene expression as a potential mediator. For eQTL SNPs, the use of gene expression information can enhance power to test for the total effect of a SNP-set, which are the combined direct and indirect effects of the SNPs mediated through the gene expression, on disease risk. We show that the test statistic under the null hypothesis follows a mixture of χ2 distributions, which can be evaluated analytically or empirically using the resampling-based perturbation method. We construct tests for each of three disease models that is determined by SNPs only, SNPs and gene expression, or includes also their interactions. As the true disease model is unknown in practice, we further propose an omnibus test to accommodate different underlying disease models. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods using simulation studies, and show that our proposed test performs well and the omnibus test can almost reach the optimal power where the disease model is known and correctly specified. We apply our method to re-analyze the overall effect of the SNP-set and expression of the ORMDL3 gene on the risk of asthma.","inCitations":["fa4df80358928cf1a7e3b2d994c31ca05e041e5f","6967a282be15fa35bde56d7c29b0113c01a78196","5c06f87f30dba84ddfc304b3e693b5e1eac0867c","f0d8e81c4b00b7ae2652f5adc2b05dd32c5f2045","4bbc6e3269abf36ea2450a8e302ebbc54d3dd97a","383bac624502a16c5bd824301bd73c99b68b6d29","74cfc11643c04f222be5b18e2c4b3a32497eff47","fd18f45c5b918e49632913110a952ccbc8090238","01de93fa7f2d4efc89975f1f638b3b5952409654","474c386ec69c9fc556a3fc1100cf81dcc6a3f119","925f6645439eff61bc18df57eb95c83c564b0b71","7a922c1241fd82ab5e769171d76b6a3b6bd440da","3c0ed2bf58437aa2dc7977d49f3b305215848422","d1520af9d62516c4ef8ea505fdac1ed19ad5b98d","c768189fd963ea574c6b939e880028466ef373c6","b14e09613d00a0133197f9df787387458cc67f48","4318623f9d96c8c374403829d8c7e1533a2edf59","b3283b39d0f930211570ee6964cc35d50c68dc36","76563b987eef394d4a47d4beff86399d342e278c","1926ee1fe7c14fa37c8bcb0ba741616547d6611b","a3c22dbdb6e824652dcbf79ae3f10bd1c2cee9c3","7458f2a8fd6fe015057aa72d55c03b8e7d6657ea","adb81ca589d2baa8953b9e111fcb7d1c2f28b85f","6787f814e5a1a6d9711e96cfc45a9c51eec41461","b8604c1c00ec3457f66a188faa1232fed33f1e22","72a655aadb41c6d1170793926d4bd223674f0ed1","000777e06f4ba43dca6ff2cec750b30d1927b164","d54247f4728e35301be116aa60dd7535c3119db4","d7f0a1e43d769e12224962b7cebfd44128cf1536","f64e3b9d59d3bbff05238c56cb2a9bc70a8e215d","fea5ec1d875b3c05122ce8f2569372c3646ec1de","472386d328e14f18b45d26186c705b65801b1345","731b165426fd35dcbabf70a7eb9f2d2111534f2d","dff826eea7001eb99dad7e8c62ae8a06ba57c72d","0bb8233d7b04ac831ae44170b486a18447b19bfc","47a1b1a16a140a75f5398b347753a5cec64b5b0b","19bc8e91df42aa796bacbca11c06c2933ceb64d1","f3fa5950ef3e81b216c03d00a11e7c60edf0c751","1ecd4588a28f9386e3cfb1f10cb9f381a602cc8c","325800548a5eecb0c0d9b0310490532b8bc9d2ab","85353eb31cbbc5b2f077e22e3cdf9cd67e50e57f","9565f318f505583ffe3db5488183265487aeac7c","7710b482b5956665598c0b8ca4c2cb37555287aa","b9ec2dcc80fe13f8e0acc5991397325651c4e198","6471422c25e7ef704c4488fffe558fdeb809fdd7","c0c75dd4acc0ecb1daaa9d2a5800bf9e14fdfe81","00cca1128467c9059c1efe5a37ce1898c47dc2eb","053bda3307a36adec7d6050b5ccb97fe0ddabd17","5e194897365e3c23640d3d74d2d96f66e6f76c8c","9d84b15cd731bffb3e6706ebcd1152dda6566c50","4c8351e2b80e46fa694e095fda5cc3fadf68457f"],"title":"Joint Analysis of Snp and Gene Expression Data in Genetic Association Studies of Complex Diseases.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS690"}

However, on-treatment CRP, given baseline CRP and treatment, is not normally distributed and outliers exist even when transformations are applied. Although classical non-parametric tests address some of these issues, they do not enable straightforward inclusion of covariate information. The aims of this study were to produce a model that improved efficiency and accuracy of analysis of CRP data. Estimation of treatment effects and identification of outliers were addressed using controlled trials of rosuvastatin. The robust statistical technique of MM-estimation was used to fit models to data in the presence of outliers and was compared with least-squares estimation. To develop the model, appropriate transformations of the response and baseline variables were selected. The model was used to investigate how on-treatment CRP related to baseline CRP and estimated treatment effects with rosuvastatin. On comparing least-squares and MM-estimation, MM-estimation was superior to least-squares estimation in that parameter estimates were more efficient and outliers were clearly identified. Relative reductions in CRP were higher at higher baseline CRP levels. There was also evidence of a dose-response relationship between CRP reductions from baseline and rosuvastatin. Several large outliers were identified, although there did not appear to be any relationships between the incidence of outliers and treatments. In conclusion, using robust estimation to model CRP data is superior to least-squares estimation and non-parametric tests in terms of efficiency, outlier identification and the ability to include covariate information.","inCitations":["cd24ada5cc2dd6bf1bb668c8e30c06ba13c67543"],"title":"Models for the analysis of C-reactive protein in statin trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.335"}

Incorporation of such time‐dependent covariates in time‐to‐event models is of great interest, but raises some challenges. Of specific concern are measurement error, and the non‐synchronous updating of covariates across individuals, due for example to missing data. It is well known that in the presence of either of these issues the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach traditionally used leads to bias. Joint models of longitudinal and time‐to‐event outcomes, developed recently, address these complexities by specifying a model for the joint distribution of all processes and are commonly fitted by maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches. However, the adequate specification of the full joint distribution can be a challenging modeling task, especially with multiple longitudinal markers. In fact, most available software packages are unable to handle more than one marker and offer a restricted choice of survival models. We propose a two‐stage approach, Multiple Imputation for Joint Modeling (MIJM), to incorporate multiple time‐dependent continuous covariates in the semi‐parametric Cox and additive hazard models. Assuming a primary focus on the time‐to‐event model, the MIJM approach handles the joint distribution of the markers using multiple imputation by chained equations, a computationally convenient procedure that is widely available in mainstream statistical software. We developed an R package “survtd” that allows MIJM and other approaches in this manuscript to be applied easily, with just one call to its main function. A simulation study showed that MIJM performs well across a wide range of scenarios in terms of bias and coverage probability, particularly compared with LOCF, simpler two‐stage approaches, and a Bayesian joint model. The Framingham Heart Study is used to illustrate the approach.","inCitations":["0ff64a4877fe9d6d49457de16ba22fd52e038272","3b726deed5298460321d9537c2f6ab0079e444be","0dd2526842e73980e268fc8fbc9f7b9f92184e54"],"title":"Survival analysis with time‐dependent covariates subject to missing data or measurement error: Multiple Imputation for Joint Modeling (MIJM)","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx046"}

The proposed method enables class prediction by an ensemble of logistic regression models for a high-dimensional data set, which is impossible by a single logistic regression model due to the restriction that the sample size needs to be larger than the number of predictors. The proposed classification method is applied to gene expression data on pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients to predict each patient's risk for treatment failure or relapse at the time of diagnosis. Hence, specific prognostic biomarkers can be used to predict outcomes in pediatric AML and formulate individual risk-adjusted treatment. Our study shows that the proposed method is comparable to other widely used models in generalized accuracy and is significantly improved in balance between sensitivity and specificity. The proposed ensemble algorithm enables the standard classification model to be used for classification of high-dimensional data.","inCitations":["8bf9116e4174a60e1b4cedc9c404d5c3beb5e01e","fc0a69da0c23fe5925fa64fb95953d2246737cc3","68786b7d0f178d584ad8c22a49095fac7136f565","3e1362da62b5581ae71c1fcd5838e415358841f1","2a5e583b4fb2dfb66f0a92a49f7d762e20a53f0d","12aceae436c6acd0e80e6050e026917bf8f2f85b","3643acc92ccc56e73e1aed3dcfb0b7aea93c8131","a81d9f0a680a7094187a0fb2c131aa8db6bc9d91"],"title":"Classification of high-dimensional data with ensemble of logistic regression models.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903280639"}

However, it has recently been shown that these types of multiple testing procedures are inefficient since such p-values do not depend upon all of the available data. This paper provides tools for constructing compound p-value statistics, which are those that depend upon all of the available data, but still satisfy the conditions of independence and uniformity under the null hypotheses. Several examples are provided, including a class of compound p-value statistics for testing location shifts. It is demonstrated, both analytically and through simulations, that multiple testing procedures tend to reject more false null hypotheses when applied to these compound p-values rather than the usual p-values, and at the same time still guarantee the desired type I error rate control. The compound p-values are used to analyze a real microarray data set and allow for more rejected null hypotheses.","inCitations":["5f979b16d652f594af251c830cb0436aa5814a22","544edefb7d8153fe46cd22601bffde542e4c0842","160599920ebaeb82bb1fdf8db87c875ab3945a2e","bf2ebf07d44d765d515451cb02d5a8355bcaa07c","be3681e06bb3b0635b9a3775935dd15c0151c823","4ac4d84f3a6ae4af83a5b425abc47c7ef332b9ac"],"title":"Compound p-value statistics for multiple testing procedures","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2014.01.007"}

The moments were derived under the assumption that the model parameters were known in advance and it was conjectured that the approximation would also be appropriate when the parameters were to be estimated. Using maximum likelihood estimation of the two-parameter logistic item response theory model, we show that the effect of parameter estimation on the distribution of Y is too large to be ignored. Consequently, we derive the asymptotic moments of Y for maximum likelihood estimation. We show using a simulation study that when the null distribution of Y is approximated using moments that take into account the effect of estimation, Y becomes a very useful statistic to assess the overall goodness of fit of models fitted to sparse 2(P) tables.","inCitations":["873a250599a1b8f006515341dc84f2aa39d90084","793a3a908d4890821824ceb82ea09d02d08a2543","6a9e93ceda21f69929fb77f78b3b49348cff9a45","59a99b1b01210d96478e5e17307dd5360cb9a22d","d1d019566aeb8e29f73aee5c00d89c137e755e7e","357feff2752d0a3170ffd8b3aee8bc8a275b0900","6e8a8bbe1bbd1d17b2d8e11d1a944feceb41c0a1","8e0179981bc85c0b773fc125500290f8fdda0150","7f8f4dc5d972e8ec6f12866328509b4d33f263cc","fe65b39253467f66a4d5bfe561b2a9225b0b1713","033ab68c429587e70b7887be8aa0a5832ddc7b92","efe10b430906e27f176cc05126f35d940ef15cbb","55ae51b14070a46a89df9e8f08096d87c09650d4","9f64dff98077e3af5bb0ba9bc8ee76842d28608b","7f3968c4b8d6c92e441abe24219562fb16829f3e","6d4d2d5346e5291621da088109848a0c1b7335aa","cfd14e99a9c1e91574d2ed99848e781dcccd58b5","e0b45222989f581d0fe6e9d8e772ba2fd146aa64","40470a1ce5d434b92d1d41ee32b9c77907efcc72","80f7bddac733101ba7d62eda37b6eea3ac8994ea","7a3d0906a22b2032dfbbc3a79a8695c160add596","f52028436c67c361fb86d38ca0d9a17a96bd9502","1c39cb5e65d58dbcc89ed792201f23f05b768d5a","9b476bec519573e8cb3dfd2bb836e38ec02295ec","d7523c07e99daa42a06088413bcd86fdb02aa783","10b373160fb77015792e42c844cc1a550068ec6a","3167fdc76bc49d44d34e8171b4fc71ca69174530","dace526d7e5ae8ccdc285c3cc65a2d3e0e5cbc0e","9bb13213bff5bc2aa780d3835ad4e09421a45320","cfc33dd32745c3658e8e97a7b349e5cc2d0ade56","c25a2505b191bf6a1877c10ec6eb3ae358e81cc3","37dffb8b4a1b67462c6114b123e475f978658e10","e7df1594de5fe464e25e11f7ec6846e30ff502a2","b020627f12b62ff3b6af67cd9a6b2f04e5372528","63465ffe1c9f28fe0cfe686a3bd66496d2ab7693","a5e0fd9592e7219424cd9ad3485d832589a2c04f","d962abdd9e4b1f8441b01346f7281043b47eb60c","14cdd0b23e01db308f1173122e94199e776f3d94","dc97c06d5188f2e5e6ae6dfc7a2298405ee1c322","038120fca65e2c9fd85c08b1ba3b12ef15095031","61670ada3fab6bfc1b45bac61af2a606026f5c25","667a7bd9a11871e03cf757f3e6d0a6c2f75a1e49","8359ea1ac24bbd3a68881b50b81ded4c99e8fb95","63723cf18696ff28c2216158f1c63ab723d0a1b3","cd24e9843998fa6eccc107ad4eea0cacdb0f885d","716a5e3cc9807a68bffd39550c86888492f6476e","05c7bc3a06822a7f53f1176f2efd91eb3d308237","e0cded2039d208ed31338680a8fba48457692ac5"],"title":"Limited-information goodness-of-fit testing of item response theory models for sparse 2 tables.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X66419"}
