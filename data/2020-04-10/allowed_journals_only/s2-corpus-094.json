High-throughput sequencing data are increasingly being used to detect and quantify CNVs; however, the distributional properties of the data are not fully understood. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed using inhomogeneous emission distributions based on negative binomial regression to account for the sequencing biases. The model is tested on the whole genome sequencing data and simulated data sets. An algorithm for CNV detection is implemented in the R package CNVfinder. The model based on negative binomial regression is shown to provide a good fit to the data and provides competitive performance compared with methods based on normalization of read counts.","inCitations":["1119329ca36f3c93e4a39bb081533443f2d6f504","7ccd08535471be451c7005b81def6a7a7f78ef90","1552bba05d18bd6adf0fe42512368f316c0e221e","fb587658c7d690a1dc3884879423b3b92ba94d3e","4fd7bd31bc7ca2ac53f4ebbd95ec8f95cb63e1c3"],"title":"Quantifying copy number variations using a hidden Markov model with inhomogeneous emission distributions.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt003"}

High-throughput techniques have enabled whole-genome analysis of histone modifications in recent years. However, most studies assume one combination of histone modification invariantly translates to one transcriptional output regardless of local chromatin environment. In this study we hypothesize that, the genome is organized into local domains that manifest similar enrichment pattern of histone modification, which leads to orchestrated regulation of expression of genes with relevant biological functions. We propose a multivariate Bayesian Change Point (BCP) model to segment the Drosophila melanogaster genome into consecutive blocks on the basis of combinatorial patterns of histone marks. By modeling the sparse distribution of histone marks with a zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, our partitions capture local BLOCKs that manifest relatively homogeneous enrichment pattern of histone marks. We further characterized BLOCKs by their transcription levels, distribution of genes, degree of co-regulation and GO enrichment. Our results demonstrate that these BLOCKs, although inferred merely from histone modifications, reveal strong relevance with physical domains, which suggests their important roles in chromatin organization and coordinated gene regulation.","inCitations":["505c0513a46a44816cf839faa0fe8ee57145b829","92a4b56bf25f7ad995ed514672cc1af13ec96609","74f03046dc0d58b4eaf6625702657a0e61f7cc53","95788198c4f740b565ceb7ed425c5fa35f7ee2cc"],"title":"Change Point Analysis of Histone Modifications Reveals Epigenetic Blocks Linking to Physical Domains.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS905"}

Variational approximations are often limited in practicality in the absence of conjugate posterior distributions. Recent work has focused on the application of variational methods to models with only partial conjugacy, such as in semiparametric regression with heteroskedastic errors. Here, both the mean and log variance functions are modeled as smooth functions of covariates. For this problem, we derive a mean field variational approximation with an embedded Laplace approximation to account for the non-conjugate structure. Empirical results with simulated and real data show that our approximate method has significant computational advantages over traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo; in this case, a delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis algorithm. The variational approximation is much faster and eliminates the need for tuning parameter selection, achieves good fits for both the mean and log variance functions, and reasonably reflects the posterior uncertainty. We apply the methods to log-intensity data from a small angle X-ray scattering experiment, in which properly accounting for the smooth heteroskedasticity leads to significant improvements in posterior inference for key physical characteristics of an organic molecule.","inCitations":["6f24d7a6e1c88828e18d16c6db20f5329f6a6827"],"title":"Laplace Variational Approximation for Semiparametric Regression in the Presence of Heteroskedastic Errors.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2014.983642"}

Studies with time-to-event outcomes have received much less attention. However, such studies can be similarly challenged with respect to the robustness and integrity of primary analysis conclusions when a substantial number of subjects withdraw from treatment prematurely prior to experiencing an event of interest. We discuss how the methods that are widely used for primary analyses of time-to-event outcomes could be extended in a clinically meaningful and interpretable way to stress-test the assumption of ignorable censoring. We focus on a 'tipping point' approach, the objective of which is to postulate sensitivity parameters with a clear clinical interpretation and to identify a setting of these parameters unfavorable enough towards the experimental treatment to nullify a conclusion that was favorable to that treatment. Robustness of primary analysis results can then be assessed based on clinical plausibility of the scenario represented by the tipping point. We study several approaches for conducting such analyses based on multiple imputation using parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric imputation models and evaluate their operating characteristics via simulation. We argue that these methods are valuable tools for sensitivity analyses of time-to-event data and conclude that the method based on piecewise exponential imputation model of survival has some advantages over other methods studied here.

To efficiently correct for bias, uniformly minimum variance conditionally unbiased estimators (UMVCUEs) have been proposed for a wide variety of trial settings, but where the population parameter estimates are assumed to be independent. We relax this assumption and derive the UMVCUE in the multivariate normal setting with an arbitrary known covariance structure. One area of application is the estimation of odds ratios (ORs) when combining a genome-wide scan with a replication study. Our framework explicitly accounts for correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms, as might occur due to linkage disequilibrium. We illustrate our approach on the measurement of the association between 11 genetic variants and the risk of Crohn's disease, as reported in Parkes and others (2007.

First, the complexity (or size) of the inequality constrained parameter spaces can be ignored. This is the case when using the posterior probability that the inequality constraints of a hypothesis hold, Bayes factors based on non-informative improper priors, and partial Bayes factors based on posterior priors. Second, the Bayes factor may not be invariant for linear one-to-one transformations of the data. This can be observed when using balanced priors which are centred on the boundary of the constrained parameter space with a diagonal covariance structure. Third, the information paradox can be observed. When testing inequality constrained hypotheses, the information paradox occurs when the Bayes factor of an inequality constrained hypothesis against its complement converges to a constant as the evidence for the first hypothesis accumulates while keeping the sample size fixed. This paradox occurs when using Zellner's g prior as a result of too much prior shrinkage. Therefore, two new methods are proposed that avoid these issues. First, partial Bayes factors are proposed based on transformed minimal training samples. These training samples result in posterior priors that are centred on the boundary of the constrained parameter space with the same covariance structure as in the sample. Second, a g prior approach is proposed by letting g go to infinity. This is possible because the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox is not an issue when testing inequality constrained hypotheses. A simulation study indicated that the Bayes factor based on this g prior approach converges fastest to the true inequality constrained hypothesis.","inCitations":["713d6105be68fa79a3a7a765131646022ca4b4cd","9d36ec1404704a2f9e435ac2193753ba00e87790","0ea2174c269f4bad44aad5ef39d30cc35553a0b2","104bf6e878d98914a45b9f7fcfec5a868389399a","35d13bb4fc8248a3329e71a2a65ab935e1d29d29","3eebe95f96bf7261294bbe6765dbbbd34fb97b2c","52c77130aeac5b77d63147ed2dff31d193753c67","bff8bd41378115b408ff9aeba800fd1d1d4268d8","558a4c92735e578707cd9e24bd73a075418fb8a9","6dbcc4c64010430df98ba02fa1b55c8e1264ed64","3dbce377c2ef034fb521b2126ded59499b490a39","a91a8672cfb540491dc1d2584181c22d64648538","5f1c211f1ecd3b3e27947275b96e9d2ab1f94a6b","d296085b30cbc41dd6845d4a609c573c00ec6d3c","4b70f293a6a73ded7551ef8d88e24da5354df9c1","b7d0ec36ca746574aa97bf8efbde033d4a7b6407","faa8bf7ca1ab12892e58278b08a9eacfa80edd82"],"title":"Bayes factors for testing inequality constrained hypotheses: Issues with prior specification.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12013"}

A common practice in studying gene-environment (GE) interactions is to analyze one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at a time. It is of significant interest to analyze SNPs in a biologically defined set simultaneously, e.g. gene or pathway. In this paper, we first show that if the main effects of multiple SNPs in a set are associated with a disease/trait, the classical single SNP-GE interaction analysis can be biased. We derive the asymptotic bias and study the conditions under which the classical single SNP-GE interaction analysis is unbiased. We further show that, the simple minimum p-value-based SNP-set GE analysis, can be biased and have an inflated Type 1 error rate. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a computationally efficient and powerful gene-environment set association test (GESAT) in generalized linear models. Our method tests for SNP-set by environment interactions using a variance component test, and estimates the main SNP effects under the null hypothesis using ridge regression. We evaluate the performance of GESAT using simulation studies, and apply GESAT to data from the Harvard lung cancer genetic study to investigate GE interactions between the SNPs in the 15q24-25.1 region and smoking on lung cancer risk.","inCitations":["f8c69061e8f32208bada72d5bbf550f336092837","0356168e352c4eca4a4494c78cee259bad093d44","a081cef56dfdaa09101bf52f6a1de5a87ff5a659","6ac4097d07f25ae5900f2baf9e6b09f069a337c3","a5f582ec88b393d101a44edd5544686c7ccdf856","764841a3ab1125fc1e0f34efcfa74927f98bec37","95ee32ba59ac4d666876752fe8bd4081bf787e10","24f58cae538ebe649cb4caf4cd3515bf5fe4dd98","4e9bbbf590b23eb9a996edda64d8be7f0e9931f0","6fd56536193807de03f6fab4d2b4ee9f367ec7d3","047b63fe9a8dc61601c43467b5ccb05cf68e5bd0","ea639e745661c0c7b860014a31f84770e69c3ac3","3b5552a3909a902c552654edb87c94969a62d9f7","022b8f9007d379fb8badb3ed6c9beaf83209f05e","718849ededc8219fc90619cbc1eb0cbf34b19f29","8bdd62cbb55a2f46bc380919f0ad6901bec6aa61","83e98797873f34d123f89538cf292c3eb8900a9a","474c386ec69c9fc556a3fc1100cf81dcc6a3f119","6b0d798522de9b6323b73e30bdbcb7f2b1e8bae0","5c06f87f30dba84ddfc304b3e693b5e1eac0867c","d1744ad39602ae2e6d27010365985d27bf973334","2c2f0f5a63677bff3e868f09e5445b47c753f2ea","028fa9c7d742cad1b9066caeece903236c2ff82d","27df90afd4a3181ce6809d1bb13cb24fa8cd0da9","7971c0e0a5a8aa9501e4efb7da0be59d1d66b623","4f8b6e6c2734de6cc59d6842f8352d0a2cc351b0","db35c2d0efcabd87f91d49ce059c9ad504ed9973","abed66efc235d0370fe9bd6795cad74191cb948c","dbf4e122b153900a650b4c9c9380b79768f4fe63","3fbcf5d1a085f6bb2445b70cf3263698603ed2d9","e0e37ce0b55916989dc19a7f70f478e533d7d58f","b919998b0b884ef772fb3c0795e945177f4b3fb4","7ab1d0caf03dafac582eaaba9f9eac5b765b0a82","a722a06e5a5aa76545b408cbffbe5d8501a02e2e","852630188b10b5ff4eb69a2c0808f9207817d93a","9285f48444e7be53c057183a0832505c35b925b3","5b07e5ab2f0f0557c1664d6a7825cceba3f15b7a","fbf967c3075633f1eab600c92da7a6b66b1c3f0e","be46d08f83e818910e785099f40543686b2ec4c6","58de77441dba399c0f5d97e41215121217f9d5f7","9e2d2c472ce09fcfb0dc599fea8a54ae130c4c25","2ab077c253975c56adfb976d17a96c72702c47f6","9f5767e9554829401b3b9ddc643e40c473d3d241","b2dd815fca625b4948a090febcc21c3afc2915c5","1732136af61bad9bd8f2d447a1bfbe537a2463bc","032150d3d81accff51d725d71258cfda4de635fe"],"title":"Test for interactions between a genetic marker set and environment in generalized linear models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt006"}

It has attracted considerable attention since then, in applications as well as methodology. It is not uncommon that some clinical trials require a stratified analysis. In this article, we propose a stratified win ratio statistic in a similar way as the Mantel-Haenszel stratified odds ratio, derive a general form of its variance estimator with a plug-in of existing or potentially new variance/covariance estimators of the number of wins for the two treatment groups, and assess its statistical performance using simulation studies. Our simulations show that our proposed Mantel-Haenszel-type stratified win ratio performs similarly to the Mantel-Haenszel stratified odds ratio for the simplified situation when the win ratio reduces to the odds ratio, and our proposed stratified win ratio is preferred compared to the inverse-variance weighted win ratio and unweighted win ratio particularly when the data are sparse. We also formulate a homogeneity test following Cochran's approach that assesses whether the stratum-specific win ratios are homogeneous across strata, as this method is used frequently in meta-analyses and a better test for the win ratio homogeneity is not available yet.","inCitations":["1542a793513b5c4253708a78df26ce2d63d7353d","4b8404811dafb2194618fe991607ca86aa5a2939"],"title":"The stratified win ratio.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1397007"}

We evaluated four tests to compare the parameters of two series of curves: a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test comparing individual estimates; a likelihood ratio test after population analysis (NONMEM), and two Wald tests using population parameters estimated by two-stage methods. The four approaches were evaluated by simulations. The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test and the population approach had adequate type-I error, and the latter provided the highest power under the alternatives simulated. The two-stage method including the uncertainty on individual estimates was disappointing.","inCitations":["9da7d0068b85d48b240409f0cf0e328134879bce","c4e1d25ae240686689482ad4b2a655cc78f06e1d","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","198e827b63111a8468937e3774828dd4102a6469","428c887affe1c126d842e3f07ae2b5d501803f8a","ed245ab3ae93594f57abdaa146c1beb68c1b32e1","538c6059185bcad96a71fa6b0ceb3f80aba4e444","0539be30d867aa7fbc8e0efa66b97a3088e66252","bcda5644ba27b93c8da523fa74bdba1d3b6ef200","d87b6a657ea101dd380eb61ea45beeade9e4e5fc","a4ec1c0a05b297b758a6feb88a74087ef4460173","79b2b12187e94c29c5d63db6e3b512c4bdb6d68c"],"title":"Evaluation of tests based on individual versus population modeling to compare dissolution curves.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100107652"}

This novel measure is relevant for shared frailty models. We show that this measure is particularly convenient, owing to its connection with the relative frailty variance and its interpretability in suggesting appropriate frailty models. We introduce a method of estimation and standard errors for this measure. We discuss its properties and compare it to an existing measure of association applicable to current status data. Small sample performance of the measure in realistic scenarios is investigated using simulations. The methods are illustrated with bivariate serological survey data on a pair of infections, where the time-varying association is likely to represent heterogeneities in activity levels and/or susceptibility to infection.","inCitations":["c03c1bfa2a20bf04caca8b6f5e174dc70fff4e22","86d766148a6957ccaab8fd23a52df83b2b493940","f0dc2492ca0bf65e33b855198d6af6d1171eb63f","0801713b34f4774e146ceb843f1c7647b5032d89","13d401781ce81585999e924c3f4df68692e4f6d8","9f208daf04075d62676196b2f5abe259916c77d4","7cc408c06c41ee4902afd612b8c9c0970ff34ff9","68cccf0dbc206cb94aea366d0440e6ef55517fc8","60d2d89c89067773eb50f0903310cdcae58799bf","4e44438677bb9e4e1bbb3b3ce429c389792ed561","4e25e29b3f7c59f46b1b76264bd70cb42ffd0548","9f9874605277f2c60bc250ada38e541ad2daee03"],"title":"A new measure of time-varying association for shared frailty models with bivariate current status data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs010"}

The test statistics in our method are nonparametric weighted areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves. By using the new method, the decision of stopping the diagnostic trial early is unlikely to be reversed should the trials continue to the planned end. The conservatism reflected in this approach to have more conservative stopping boundaries during the course of the trial is especially appealing for diagnostic trials since the end point is not death. In addition, the maximum sample size of our method is not greater than a fixed sample test with similar power functions. Simulation studies are performed to evaluate the properties of the proposed sequential procedure. We illustrate the method using data from a thoracic aorta imaging study.","inCitations":["f51b5cf45958620f3f24068e9e80415a5504295a","e46dd038e1d27ab6432fc4e3a7f88d2f4ba1a5ec"],"title":"A sequential conditional probability ratio test procedure for comparing diagnostic tests.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2010.515678"}

While matching is intended to eliminate confounding, the main potential benefit of matching in case-control studies is a gain in efficiency. Methods for analyzing matched case-control studies have focused on utilizing conditional logistic regression models that provide conditional and not causal estimates of the odds ratio. This article investigates the use of case-control weighted targeted maximum likelihood estimation to obtain marginal causal effects in matched case-control study designs. We compare the use of case-control weighted targeted maximum likelihood estimation in matched and unmatched designs in an effort to explore which design yields the most information about the marginal causal effect. The procedures require knowledge of certain prevalence probabilities and were previously described by van der Laan (2008). In many practical situations where a causal effect is the parameter of interest, researchers may be better served using an unmatched design.","inCitations":["34312d435dded2a5f9d3079625a131c8c1d01baf","3b65b151935f7778d835a473d30598bfcaba8508","f453ddc2131a5e5265701d564a09a7d0f7a28a0e","a25fea3d07ac0037ca714a91373a0549ba0550d8","56b0a726d17e0eb8ebdd8911fc001571f15fedd5","3131604b0854842e23a8209534fcbf496d34dcb1","b669a6fff30ea7be5909e90f33a3767687150486","c21200a24d762101180f6ea0882a454ee2524497","49cbb31c6733975da82a27f685d9c99832556b6c","3f38cddfc874de9709a487d9362a82f404f559aa","351dc5c7d6199410376b8550aa27486e009b1baf","34288746badec1cd5721b4a8cd64b3599aa026dc","0499c6b59e8de9ba17d0ca2f282a8352545e2c6e","25b201f01ca778327d6672613aac18a0923219d9","b149aa1b6f947e263751e8f760532ac161a11364","46cc8b81fa8757c00f1064cec283f96cebb10692","8e3f8e684d0fa04a8311cf9ab917badb1cd6f0fc","e158ea00669155bf8614a70604f04fbb6753f447","2dbf49dd1ce2c742f4416f072f282df5b79ff64b","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c","7077353ec1430aa2d22a67724c471ac8d5afeeba","e467f142d79b4983e7d8f73a4c8c6efd0d8411e1","d1afc1bac9c451642735a9d50f4f1503db7b19f8","83b71704c1d90cbe694ba8a7f2a478934c74cde3","d4150404eaefa5b1f6721023e54e46cc69a1b796","13b8f0f0e65cc94a3b1852f3eec2cd30b632de1e","feeef2072f66474dd8d78cd828d0e40d38bd6e36","63777db388d93ef3001b7cf0e17290e73fca11cb","998056c5c6bd4c5d34b669b60fbdc84906e41984","240ff8117fbcdfb731ecbc9ea48e1d5ad03cd084","5f64c9eb14ed629dc832d0b67d899a64b8fa342d","20dc2a592df682b3935da1fbfcf9c6ff6405cab3","ad0eb70e3db9a66e710cbaf8a5fbcbd7a9790e89","1620383cd745edbe25f2e2c88dd827cd61ec0a9c","4ce48e5f84b3f57185d55ece1626ce8a931c807b","454527b699660b7112350b321cfa5b19ed0c49ae","23addc7334b3ee4424012a9728c914e92b418207","d878657a550729ed6cdd5c14c6f6738c015c8c78","c2821b00bc66f603ce04eabb8bfef5ccd22ecec7","956a8c998bfede37149b0754e8af4399ddacfc13","3c70fb47b590aac9b6a0de0bd621d9d535e1453a","88a743201c945cb672c94edc64f7e9a44889db31","ccbd9779ede3b9369787e207be34e60a0cd3dd9c","48f3fa77a1564444cabc18f6326ee9bd50feeacc","2d49eadd1725c1d743c028bce0c70ff4ebc9bbb8","65056b43ea4413935148ae06ff8d8736dfdbb49d","529cd7aa414da91d92fa005779b27e48f1772c8e","d63ef00dc6ccc5414484722fd1eaf697d424455a","6a6c89c7f51433681dfa6edb73779acbaf5a02d6","e3f91dde41bc4035afbf7c151028c14f087fcf0e","56d03184b80ee01dbdbca33d2e5d0db10273c1d2","4dc85b318034103ce7cc33b02d7c9233a65cc995","2a1e401a7f74da727ef4c9fbdc6e1dddfd110a28","689e6a2411091dd08ffa45c4b281244a50c12475","eda26d85139ecd39c0f8f79911bddb62f72922b9","dc93e93b6ae66a11fd928485c8d2e12a5dfac6bc","459950f9cf585ef8deacbb70f1b3caec26bf82cd","ac75c994b0eb2b733f8d2b4e3d122a7020ab9791","a8390e7b1a4a94bf48cd4673492ad43cdc805ca3","91e6eec19cd484e54e7e9ab625e0edab2e638212","5c317ca9913989d52fde8976ec2718848f1cc157","55a239cfa25c6eb109a3bcb1bd8e0cd952c7d098","18205fb6d7d49e0f96b78debb396315001c33a2f","1f3c83e84d2111795508c7cab4ab6103689ef73b","2c404ed635778af589194dd947e00290456681a5","c669652ca8dcca72b61c523a4d044f78e128a756","d7b372beb9814316d19487ccb1a4e827b747b39e","d6a996792ab6536df191b22cb61c5f84ddac89a2","9151d84629277bab26148bdb6379626b44e1cd0a","79978ac4f28263b0615cbc488a7e656e3be90750","ae39445824046836504ddea0f6eda632bdb69d67","2596380c956a1227533e29fa77352f0536afc669","8716eda855fcccabc984129b3760731d43409a90","16d1e3aa7c8c627ad5dbc82591cba093c3e4c762","0e8167593163879e58affbd3311213a5f272611d","4c0a7b1a1ff70a2ccd8029670ab3eb5dcbe87de8","b69b655a76282996ae517d723e883116ecf2000a","b0b2c40e5689c5e0f6cf234d2ad48c6151da2efc","121c0ae3aec027630bcf36fafdf6f91fb93c4b48","eb91ee84dee846d1f5f18771a31a85e71a1b4c7d","52b814fe96fd388e6f0b6efb90724035ec7d2905","fc41ac21596f8d2da1214f9c0fca9f4942639340","5fb32304f57b38be14140e6e5f87497d35d96a2c","8c396553f0b80c7dc92cf371c451988a99d42133","5ceecb36fc4e87e77e2d320192677e225e0e7938","b8f9c997c2429ee69a01c4d796e5efe04a34c19b","574ab91ded9229886c1484cb59f6ce2784ce6de7","da06943dc51d916322c554426e1cdc45db5567ca","7a99018139351f5c27407c04a375066bf1494258","8b5d5b2b9b63692423f928933ffc525a8c18b20d","53cf61f530efc9451d2f90566677b0a8034116e5","f8cf8f35d47f078fb2cd9ee179bcd68eae08ddc6","ec9b4452288f0e34c98e60563d1d22cc187982d2","9b778a3b1abfb03f731ed466e93f5843bb7ab171","c59eee8854a8a402a79c8acb5fa94b0e70075ca4","876bcb738602e4ef0d087645cb5cd715b7c10540","dda4f021cdf7264ae68743de6d55ee0bda1c5811","e50d38a05f3065633ae5c733fe6b30e209c673d2","2165eab8a25414be16c1b37033aa4613190760bf","c32b6881cf7811dec7082d773e766e1a5ac89695","d665885794fe660564d54414cfaa3c0ba8855ea3","77047d93c1b02a98df6e7b1ded41408e6806072f","eddc2deb1dc88b61137df2877ec6970d669a8997","5f561f92ceffeff37b1782a22a19ee86ba597ce9"],"title":"Why Match?

Marginalized random effects models are a class of models that permit direct estimation of marginal mean parameters and characterize serial correlation for longitudinal categorical data via random effects (Heagerty, 1999). Marginally specified logistic-normal models for longitudinal binary data. Biometrics 55, 688-698; Lee and Daniels, 2008. Marginalized models for longitudinal ordinal data with application to quality of life studies. Statistics in Medicine 27, 4359-4380). In this paper, we propose a Kronecker product (KP) covariance structure to capture the correlation between processes at a given time and the correlation within a process over time (serial correlation) for bivariate longitudinal ordinal data. For the latter, we consider a more general class of models than standard (first-order) autoregressive correlation models, by re-parameterizing the correlation matrix using partial autocorrelations (Daniels and Pourahmadi, 2009). Modeling covariance matrices via partial autocorrelations. Journal of Multivariate Analysis 100, 2352-2363). We assess the reasonableness of the KP structure with a score test. A maximum marginal likelihood estimation method is proposed utilizing a quasi-Newton algorithm with quasi-Monte Carlo integration of the random effects. We examine the effects of demographic factors on metabolic syndrome and C-reactive protein using the proposed models.","inCitations":["0fd77313d547517b75686569d62e90f8dfcc8483","b4313d90d8b568f7813ec1e21b3224d131a2a33d","0fdfe410bd6dec14af9fda7bc31401e246277e8c","6759dd3ce5caed95b58f3148c1cd63ca8b5c0386","207640856d298423810c17fa1a77551c59da8828","1bef9ff36e9e33742b8751c8e244efdf32f28c1b"],"title":"Flexible marginalized models for bivariate longitudinal ordinal data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs058"}

Two definitions of EC50/IC50s are considered: relative and absolute. The relative EC50/IC50 is the parameter c in the 4-parameter logistic model and is the concentration corresponding to a response midway between the estimates of the lower and upper plateaus. The absolute EC50/IC50 is the response corresponding to the 50% control (the mean of the 0% and 100% assay controls). The guidelines first describe how to decide whether to use the relative EC50/IC50 or the absolute EC50/IC50. Assays for which there is no stable 100% control must use the relative EC50/IC50. Assays having a stable 100% control but for which there may be more than 5% error in the estimate of the 50% control mean should use the relative EC50/IC50. Assays that can be demonstrated to produce an accurate and stable 100% control and less than 5% error in the estimate of the 50% control mean may gain efficiency as well as accuracy by using the absolute EC50/IC50. Next, the guidelines provide rules for deciding when the EC50/IC50 estimates are reportable. The relative EC50/IC50 should only be used if there are at least two assay concentrations beyond the lower and upper bend points. The absolute EC50/IC50 should only be used if there are at least two assay concentrations whose predicted response is less than 50% and two whose predicted response is greater than 50%.

Although statistical models for ordinally-observed response variables are well known, relatively little attention has been given to the problem of ordinally-observed regressors. In this paper I show that if surrogates to ordinally-observed covariates are used as regressors in a generalized linear model then the resulting measurement error in the covariates can compromise the consistency of point estimators and standard errors for the effects of fully-observed regressors. To properly account for this measurement error when making inferences concerning the fully-observed regressors, I propose a general modelling framework for generalized linear models with ordinally-observed covariates. I discuss issues of model specification, identification, and estimation, and illustrate these with examples.","inCitations":["7656e50073e33cc9ed7adddf58ba995c70ffdd66","37c75a4346d68b203e3ebc3b47767ab009358ff8","11506f9c79cbd3d5258ac54247fa23d43c02bcf6"],"title":"Generalized linear models with ordinally-observed covariates.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X65762"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2008,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"The goodness-of-fit test based on Pearson's chi-squared statistic is sometimes considered to be an omnibus test that gives little guidance to the source of poor fit when the null hypothesis is rejected. It has also been recognized that the omnibus test can often be outperformed by focused or directional tests of lower order. In this paper, a test is considered for a model on a data table formed by the cross-classification of q dichotomous variables, and a score statistic on overlapping cells that correspond to the first- through qth-order marginal frequencies is presented. Then orthogonal components of the Pearson-Fisher statistic are defined on marginal frequencies. The orthogonal components may be used to form test statistics, and a log-linear version of an item response model is used to investigate the order and dilution of a test based on these components, as well as the projection of components onto the space of lower-order marginals. The advantage of the components in terms of power and detection of the source of poor fit is demonstrated. Overcoming the adverse effects of sparseness provides another motive for using components based on marginal frequencies because an asymptotic chi-squared distribution will be more reliable for a statistic formed on overlapping cells if expected frequencies in the joint distribution are small.","inCitations":["d7523c07e99daa42a06088413bcd86fdb02aa783","14cdd0b23e01db308f1173122e94199e776f3d94","cfd14e99a9c1e91574d2ed99848e781dcccd58b5","6e8a8bbe1bbd1d17b2d8e11d1a944feceb41c0a1","b6dd42caeb3552a3eb39357a0f3c7484e8414960","cde3c46a98b9d64f98c655dd87c8a2b8bc480496","cc1100df18cfd1f809507a0d71440b9897519e90","7f3968c4b8d6c92e441abe24219562fb16829f3e","10b373160fb77015792e42c844cc1a550068ec6a","b2c72c951b484b43e3b69f4fdb5b659a424cf3d0","8359ea1ac24bbd3a68881b50b81ded4c99e8fb95"],"title":"Goodness-of-fit testing using components based on marginal frequencies of multinomial data.","doi":"10.1348/000711007X204215"}
