A non-pooled Welch-type statistic (WJ) and the Huynh Improved General Approximation (IGA) test generally have been found to be effective in controlling rates of Type I error in unbalanced non-spherical repeated measures designs even though data are non-normal in form and covariance matrices are heterogeneous. However, under some conditions of departure from multisample sphericity and multivariate normality their rates of Type I error have been found to be elevated. Westfall and Young's results suggest that Type I error control could be improved by combining bootstrap methods with methods based on trimmed means. Accordingly, in our investigation we examined four methods for testing for main and interaction effects in a between- by within-subjects repeated measures design: (a) the IGA and WJ tests with least squares estimators based on theoretically determined critical values; (b) the IGA and WJ tests with least squares estimators based on empirically determined critical values; (c) the IGA and WJ tests with robust estimators based on theoretically determined critical values; and (d) the IGA and WJ tests with robust estimators based on empirically determined critical values. We found that the IGA tests were always robust to assumption violations whether based on least squares or robust estimators or whether critical values were obtained through theoretical or empirical methods. The WJ procedure, however, occasionally resulted in liberal rates of error when based on least squares estimators but always proved robust when applied with robust estimators. Neither approach particularly benefited from adopting bootstrapped critical values. Recommendations are provided to researchers regarding when each approach is best.","inCitations":["44ef49bb95c9a6e53224a71f53620170f6c09d57","c18b09bddd08158ae3eae9f845a30ad4a93b6953","b277feb3eaa1c1d13f7fab70693570e91ea95cca","f9dc07026bc49b1b380c8f244b138628de181be1","0f5b7d37b969675170d385e711c95984b9e6da08","acdf8a75793f8d387fe564224c28fc7f8c06625e","605985fd267f282d84c426b5b82bf22be1b3a734","7a64c6f66d741fb89007a7ca2a9f615e2eafa5e2","fd7bd6242655ebc73303aa25a01faab164a975d8","21c13d7a403b1a5926bff5dfeb25d35d39337e76","550b62996adccb8d9dcfbf9578190a3e1cf9ae7a","7b40285a1111e623ae111f25fc77b586f3d76d16","ddc6d4600b3ebbb25b02f0be68ed73a896cd7492","f135f4ec208fc0f7d00da87611c3b1f043c32897","eb22bc1f7c4f736b2d8fddec80312b1de9ac36f8","3af6ed848d4ce5eec98d93ea901c88c2bf237845","78a6ed23d23bd13273beb59f6bcb621f6ec0dd81","4297e34b99c7a65917a139bec56e6325d6e3585d","3a0ccb3a35ae8fe6ea4e4da1ef0e4ceb3c29a456","fce9eca8e684a28711fb94e97f5b39332cb5784d","e22a7b2ab7b56201f9686534146353ace23c68c1","1904e9cfd50d31736a7a9fd41e71811c4dcec041","a6ae5ea1b72a61b9d6a3143917deef50f67854c6","0270a328175ffa4590f0180c801267947a2c260e","fec611fcf7716535e2bf672a8bdcacd47a5abeae","d4665b13a0e8188fb9c11390b858b197df8254cd","87a28f1ce59ee32d46f30e4f7b4d3f78849c4b0a","986513ecc90ba254a2f36fe4517595c00900bcd2","f0a771c8b42d989ba13809b1f1eda7486ab42aab","fb05f2f7371e075c926713728b51f0410f220725"],"title":"Testing treatment effects in repeated measures designs: trimmed means and bootstrapping.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159286"}

The key step in any TMLE implementation is constructing a sequence of least-favorable parametric models for the parameter of interest. This has been done for a variety of parameters arising in causal inference problems, by augmenting standard regression models with a “clever-covariate.” That approach requires deriving such a covariate for each new type of problem; for some problems such a covariate does not exist. To address these issues, we give a general TMLE implementation based on exponential families. This approach does not require deriving a clever-covariate, and it can be used to implement TMLE for estimating any smooth parameter in the nonparametric model. A computational advantage is that each iteration of TMLE involves estimation of a parameter in an exponential family, which is a convex optimization problem for which software implementing reliable and computationally efficient methods exists. We illustrate the method in three estimation problems, involving the mean of an outcome missing at random, the parameter of a median regression model, and the causal effect of a continuous exposure, respectively. We conduct a simulation study comparing different choices for the parametric submodel. We find that the choice of submodel can have an important impact on the behavior of the estimator in finite samples.","inCitations":["2172fd75b7e6e8db47d8f709ceda45c60029363a","d237d0b857fc17692f3e970460e1103415126ddf","4b3e0f6976acd8b16ac0f448585a176095bd08fa"],"title":"Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation using Exponential Families","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2014-0039"}

Here, we focus on the mean residual life (MRL) function, which provides the expected remaining lifetime given that a subject has survived (i.e. is event-free) up to a particular time. This function is of direct interest in reliability, medical, and actuarial fields. In addition to its practical interpretation, the MRL function characterizes the survival distribution. We develop general Bayesian nonparametric inference for MRL functions built from a Dirichlet process mixture model for the associated survival distribution. The resulting model for the MRL function admits a representation as a mixture of the kernel MRL functions with time-dependent mixture weights. This model structure allows for a wide range of shapes for the MRL function. Particular emphasis is placed on the selection of the mixture kernel, taken to be a gamma distribution, to obtain desirable properties for the MRL function arising from the mixture model. The inference method is illustrated with a data set of two experimental groups and a data set involving right censoring. The supplementary material available at Biostatistics online provides further results on empirical performance of the model, using simulated data examples.","inCitations":["5370186d95553b1ddb02b583766f0c6846c94444","ab8866e4579d98b0f9738131efd2e01b379e85dc","8be899be1bbd04c121853dadeb0fdda8ceb0be57","6c60c2c082526afc0f76db5b73a14b1478e7ff3b","f01319d2e568f4e6cfd4c79646d36c9f42b656ba"],"title":"Nonparametric Bayesian inference for mean residual life functions in survival analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx075"}

We propose to take into account these dependencies inthe HMM model. When dealing with a large number of series, maximum likelihood inference (performed classically using the EM algorithm) becomes intractable.

Based on these results, we establish that the covariance matrix for the multinomial distribution is positive semidefinite and that the reduced matrix is positive definite. In addition, we show that the determinant of the reduced matrix is invariant to the particular row and column that are removed.

It tries to detect patterns in the data that occur significantly more or significantly less often than expected by chance. Patterns which occur more often than expected by chance are called CFA types, while those which occur less often than expected by chance are called CFA antitypes. The patterns detected are used to generate knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the data. We investigate the ability of CFA to detect adequate types and antitypes in a number of simulation studies. The basic idea of these studies is to predefine sets of types and antitypes and a mechanism which uses them to create a simulated data set. This simulated data set is then analysed with CFA and the detected types and antitypes are compared to the predefined ones. The predefined types and antitypes together with the method to generate the data are called a data generation model. The results of the simulation studies show that CFA can be used in quite different research contexts to detect structural dependencies in observed data. In addition, we can learn from these simulation studies how much data is necessary to enable CFA to reconstruct the predefined types and antitypes with sufficient accuracy. For one of the data generation models investigated, implicitly underlying knowledge space theory, it was shown that zero-order CFA can be used to reconstruct the predefined types (which can be interpreted in this context as knowledge states) with sufficient accuracy.

Furthermore, the assumption of independence of observations within cluster does not hold, of course, because the subjects share the same cluster. Moreover, when the clustered outcomes are binary, a mixed effect logistic regression model is applicable. This article compares the performance of a maximum likelihood estimation of the mixed effects logistic regression model with equal and unequal cluster sizes. This was evaluated in terms of type I error rate, power, bias, and standard error through computer simulations that varied treatment effect, number of clusters, and intracluster correlation coefficients. The results show that the performance of the mixed effects logistic regression model is very similar, regardless of inequality in cluster size. This is illustrated using data from the Prevention Of Suicide in Primary care Elderly: Collaborative Trial (PROSPECT) study.","inCitations":["fd3dc51f9e94ce60304ce7ca8548d17a352f8da5","331a3b935c8257cd06ceb1f6d19ffae524766f07","0d30dcdbbb02257c505d6145c495c024f620702c","4b39b2e3280b595d6578d50983085673e88bc6a3","bd2aa53846bd7e86d804c8a981198cc01d18a069","e75b1825d6a306d31454c255eff430fc01a5e137","a0dc523ee9a976cdd3f5e78c1f2021563d08e706","f41408725ac37de9e83c32ed3c0057db331b8f75","ce5adfb02811b51aabb431b602f7fffc2d2986e7","eae890dc03fd396be6d064f0ac337e327a38b760","4beff8a1bc1c2c423daa98817679a07020e6ffbc","cbab0cc7fd631d125bee2ca71f758fe53833b0f6","6f8a175094ebceea458f600aad8ba8c812234135","04c85194fa00579a03baca7ab593ebc509f9fd7c","2c8aa0dae0951d6c359cdbe96673b42ef0dc27bf","734e85937e785e1905e14148d443a3f2e673ddce","6e3f6bc17a3b37064c387b91d02ccac430437ff5"],"title":"Performance of a mixed effects logistic regression model for binary outcomes with unequal cluster size.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200056554"}

While a subset of interaction terms can be obtained by existing variable selection methods to indicate relevant covariates for making treatment decision, there often lacks statistical interpretation of the results. This paper proposes an asymptotically unbiased estimator based on Lasso solution for the interaction coefficients. We derive the limiting distribution of the estimator when baseline function of the regression model is unknown and possibly misspecified. Confidence intervals and p-values are derived to infer the effects of the patients' covariates in making treatment decision. We confirm the accuracy of the proposed method and its robustness against misspecified function in simulation and apply the method to STAR*D study for major depression disorder.","inCitations":["f830716e01267158f333c69d68f25c392a3629ac","8c030ad2344a9e934c4d905f9148990753939434","c13165a56a1cbe477f378cea0b856d7eff42cb63","1001ca294f6a9124aa548b532bc3bc550964635a","fd836e39c289f8a0823711317e861d6b10018670"],"title":"High-Dimensional Inference for Personalized Treatment Decision.","doi":"10.1214/18-EJS1439"}

We propose a principal stratification method designed to examine causal effects of a regulation on health that are and are not associated with causal effects of the regulation on air quality. A novel feature of our approach is the accommodation of a continuously scaled multivariate intermediate response vector representing multiple pollutants. Furthermore, we use a spatial hierarchical model for potential pollution concentrations and ultimately use estimates from this model to assess validity of assumptions regarding interference.

Nearly all of this work is done in the univariate case and employs an improper specification. Our contribution here is to move to multivariate conditional autoregressive models and to provide rich, flexible classes which yield proper distributions. Our approach is to introduce spatial autoregression parameters. We first clarify what classes can be developed from the family of Mardia (1988) and contrast with recent work of Kim et al. (2000). We then present a novel parametric linear transformation which provides an extension with attractive interpretation. We propose to employ these models as specifications for second-stage spatial effects in hierarchical models. Two applications are discussed; one for the two-dimensional case modelling spatial patterns of child growth, the other for a four-dimensional situation modelling spatial variation in HLA-B allele frequencies. In each case, full Bayesian inference is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.","inCitations":["ce60b6243d14d98d58a021820e4ca3e6a5c12ff4","3b591cb340679c3b20becc7c1bcb179220655d16","bd7db0f729f87e345f0bd246f7932331a8812e5f","bd6e132b7dd74ea1ad9f6e61a73cda2a1c4e00e3","2a7c07cebb47c057dd2b8057c7a84cc7634eaefd","f19ca60ff2b5616cc7a08adcf32d11dc8d5108f6","dc4c20477032e7b8a15c924d68a742fadfa3c13b","d508ae4a6c9aa686b156b9e9930896d814354e8b","d7c3c12dbde839febd8d3183b775d44267f0575b","15e80e558cf9276e088385ae9e15bc70ccd37d4e","15df46c6dc9cdb61ba0e43b7f79872231aa256db","25698da613aa282148b8484d5c2f32712dd88278","f7a6f7285b4ec032ca4cf32355faaec03d080ae3","21e16b9d0fdf3b85c876d0163b903d46f293d109","b3ad157022e14e226797f5f81901930583cf9a55","258522eab5c837f26a8829c4821a8f2bc7df1bb8","b10bf9a79fd3cb5c3eb6d2ecc462b538a0d5ae5e","bacd30c3ef45a5427b9ee1c940dee1fc07dacd0d","d5212e49fdb0ede179eb54cf7da9e9de1a7df3e4","512cf3f112aed25db9fa4f68b3927f822f841c23","05432fefcafbedfc82f8946ba476b69fe07a0f52","cb94db82383b3c308da146f604426de50e43e741","a7c13574744e396dbfedcf5b15d843a10db37157","c6625ebdc68ed9cfea85e2a667922c4b0d9c5eda","ff7497555156fac769585f4cefea5176ad3a81cd","d950f5f91a330d36b8cf5d7463c3bf584fd334ed","8a6065ec87614332afc0040ca0cebef3fff80e70","17cdf616ec225888ea289594a82c3f7035ee4aa5","54479a222920eccaf98c220de66b75fd026c96c4","4a77ec1af7a50ffcca38b740e566d516f0f68e39","cff3ec4ef1c57957963ee4baa9b2438f3a3384fa","84cea03ecd4fdc34a7244d94e52ecffc2bbc3a21","d445a14586c2f040ce0adcd65b1692e36bf6c374","188280ca2d31a112e7f97302524bd131df8d06b0","eca8c3c3d9e4964e49163c929b01f98e53cb65de","3819b56cf7d808d31071f28fdbe81a3cc2d130f6","11e60a852b2cd1385c63c8143ced2113d67f5ab8","f5db3905d6000a6b4326be9fbd9382e2c8ab55cb","31b9aa29ea7eafc160cd4bc51334f563a1859969","a1f3b537722a6ab06f5a27cf025439a75166a3d9","2dd6d3a7525954aa609a648e6837075e8822b6c8","37bd3f207189dd4bb5b819fda55b1e91c0afd00a","c4dedaa53af48043c064c6cc5d5aeff18106fd55","062470df20b93b9f67f1bf8b7ccf40dcf7e8de55","e543d33a198cf1ad5a08ccc8482bede224713d5c","2303179f0c5f954679e2ddd9b8eefec877d6cd50","ea9afe2923ea9276afad80fb4372af2d94d43a2b","4c83d68f257e0177fad7621870aca750edb2ec44","efaf93ec697e4620593be73eefcb49fb45017ceb","3fa14344d3fae560c496017e88fb2d9014107d5a","76b09fbd1f4a543f3d752403c269e7152426459f","bc2b0cc880354ade3122cf56389212df5866b5b4","dd99026dbd038b2c73c62bb38f453dbd261f7ed9","d49be18d4b3be6ae91af183002eaf07fc06f2324","764ad2e83d5e244bf34b79d22eeb7530e060d933","8d95638ae126f4f41fe284fdfdf05cdb4ac1fa31","e859c480017c95328189f2608fcb1c8517ab0523","b68531ac6218d67ee9f9d9548d19c2c0772017bf","d5c9fa75914cfa8f62243260dac7de5d1b4a41ae","6caed9bd59175fd56bde8f87a8cd3105e50109dc","7bcc83b920ad6f49b4a75c2dc10aa737242c4282","78b5190f62e61f08121214b74525f55b04926caa","65145a15a4881f5d3193c72ff175df96e5bab42c","e5990c8d7c276a34938839a23e9d80b482ca2e19","791fb65425abb0144608f5cdbca634f8810fc512","4bd25ad239af9031441715613327738cf8aa04ab","c89de9a45194f6f457d3bd22cd55b2de62861f1b","c622a8e03d8785c4759ad95080a27d81218dc828","b289d3f19591f5c33ca7ed10f4125dbdca5c241e","fc838259c30f526fd4f81c173c48f1ded4b87a8a","970583fee038090646d0b386204ba29a643e0c3b","ce9f14c29c58e4aa70023162b3a616fd9287e386","e9d6e769868b0bb4072125d663a798797db03c09","d6d0609d905125d7095853c62afb825298c22aeb","26777142a3aa768e2d52d85651f0d24e081dfffb","269400b429005ab47372b30f71e16bd57854023e","58de7a14eba521f9d22e397ddfe884454845a24d","b1674a045f6ec89fe8941f652d44a7786e4b4baf","829ba4071b2bf4a22c9f229e2807057a8d100e04","2177b353dea5308b0f655c2927118f53b5f8644e","cd0b36f119142f97098f57a4df9dac528cedc233","e7340df4c511b1d78efa938c46a8a11df36cc28f","7cb6e4a117c50ffe77b421445f09cab9fbba8c56","ec95d4221177adb12ffa4b669f0f1f310da153a2","210c6aaab4191e7d850f160029d354e0eab79cb1","e84190eac259d471cf334b00e387973479f04db9","fe1f118a8b0eaf9ab28b5915573fc93045f9047d","0317e4b8dbcdb6d755f9683a128553ccf32a73c0","10c81ae8ebc287bd5193989d8e0331823bd23542","59345101b99ec543d1eb2f745298b5122c165268","950d76c5df10070490c284f801d3c3524eb12d5e","9aace31de6c491b27fece58c7423bdaa7a287242","f81e165da56468a3ad0e6a2d85776d11509e598e","6411b9e12a9b87a3c4a8056627780fcdc7c3e382","5ad17b6a050da8ce023989cb0cb4a3767037a607","ce167a5056ff49618f819b852622c75315606661","a9669ece023367c048e11ec600052e79d958c96f","94e2216fe74fb468293a94430910423989a9c183","a4f4c064ea3021dafeb339be9d1c56eac0e30cfa","87608c087a40801027e254875a821b5532595e13","00bbbd51146cea57ef780a891579d0623d1679f1","bfe5305adae6aea58edc9e7159aa89a8bddfa966","897d62b99167dfa73125baf70334fd8bb268ffd8","64f40cb605f2fd38bf5002bdad589248c81cfc73","ae6932c8600794d2e2ededb620b9742aef9aef07","e0dd71adee12d9b4a71b9bf3566479025a79f9dc","e2af08fea79dd8d9e6ea4c02a36dbca440216bab","e1dd0bb9323230d21465a276448954b414d7e500","541abd0d0b6c6343c2432a5656081400725b8ebf","f49ae93bf8b3ad762753dd5b400328e2d1b82662","aeba5733bdad630ad8ca37455f179dc2130b7117","e6f5e5dc00e0dca0edc6d01325335a46293c98e5","9c852101ae3a9b61252ab92b7970c17812ed888a","88063d2cb19824f72b00a7e2da2d6b315afcae5d","a58d1bba6cc95cda97e61e9d08e67c971cffd61f","2fa7d86cb76ecef816daa9dc51

The presentation emphasizes measurement error modeling and related data analysis methods, since addressing measurement issues appears to be central to these topics and to progress in nutritional epidemiology more generally. The manner in which body mass index is modeled in disease association analysis is particularly challenging, since it could serve as a mediator or as a confounder of the association, and at the same time contributes valuably to energy and protein consumption assessment. A hazard ratio parameter estimation procedure that acknowledges body mass index as a possible mediating variable is described and applied. Some aspects of the future nutritional epidemiology research agenda are briefly discussed, including an ongoing human feeding study to develop biomarkers for additional dietary components.","inCitations":["f1158c52172a841fc42b5d1c7e8a477be9e882aa","17b4a2b523f2b32b008c02cb9b844bbb9bc0946f","dd904e294f8ce99aebb967deca9d0a416cd9f6b3","f886bfbd7ece26d3b4f5be9bdb5bc953b5f11244","ab700ea07861173e504594dc56cae226c0f0b282","cf4a304ddeccfc1626b2a5d04666141752e75cc0","4e7a2dc1aae19d74d7045624037844f8c5544e69","cfa44e09aca9862d0842c844984a0d81ee300f32","29b2f2d97b6806d524b7555a9181487e156e76c0","c3bc8664e6cba5e8bd9ad65998e974e31a5f198f","b005868d34f9fa2499ce14c3d8402449eb3bbd03","e68cbd0791fa459c0867da1aeb9f8005ce49e162","1bb855b79a8f2b3a19990c24c50025a506667c6d","df1b0039ea1239b10554c6016b72a3c4d4ba32af","c7bb2ad1146df2d7d1e50ed8d9bea9462c4bd3a1","24190a800699270fe4d723f61b6930c63bbf243a","6d2d18645cd5f3846f56c4a8ccf972f01c1e2d9b","dcc8f4f4d84ea47c2d9ab35f482e63b556b3739d","cc2a91b9d2ce364b6b656beabced92ed7c4e1e97","26df925c9b42ef958070be7a59e6abf089cb68d1","f8954fc6f91bb10d8b43cb4064eae02cc1ae6338"],"title":"Measurement error modeling and nutritional epidemiology association analyses.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.10116"}

We propose a semiparametric Bayesian approach to multivariate longitudinal data using a mixture of Polya trees prior distribution. Usually, the distribution of random effects in a longitudinal data model is assumed to be Gaussian. However, the normality assumption may be suspect, particularly if the estimated longitudinal trajectory parameters exhibit multimodality and skewness. In this paper we propose a mixture of Polya trees prior density to address the limitations of the parametric random effects distribution. We illustrate the methodology by analyzing data from a recent HIV-AIDS study.","inCitations":["5dc7ad24ff72ed441b428233ced585a50c31d666","92262b2568ceb99a39434f0f0f41965162c2f27a","f28da3c6cf211c28b8dfaf24b88d76996a279976","11165e08bf9399a5063e5f3ff1cf509db6914a48","6b90eb8180eb44405e6fbcdef77070c048e9186b","b6103f91771c4729237d680913f91c5e59bda662","a2fb08fd9106d0e672811a76c484c1aa79fe623b","b56eedcb578f2a19e8507edbf428e8c5f3c8128d","096d3c1ef7ec711da19cad43f409626d3e16b89f","f2b26726f2bce247f795daa80c97cdedd4b8d6dd","f22681e3096a5c424393132564723d5a1db36038","c7065d79a41b2b47f3275e3231d1804d75bcd7c1","32b55af097d8b501536ebcfc775117a55bf44293"],"title":"A Semiparametric Bayesian Approach to Multivariate Longitudinal Data.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-842X.2010.00581.x"}

These functional measurements carry different types of information about the scientific process, and a joint analysis that integrates information across them may provide new insights into the underlying mechanism for the phenomenon under study. Motivated by fluorescence spectroscopy data in a cervical pre-cancer study, a multivariate functional response regression model is proposed, which treats multivariate functional observations as responses and a common set of covariates as predictors. This novel modeling framework simultaneously accounts for correlations between functional variables and potential multi-level structures in data that are induced by experimental design. The model is fitted by performing a two-stage linear transformation-a basis expansion to each functional variable followed by principal component analysis for the concatenated basis coefficients. This transformation effectively reduces the intra-and inter-function correlations and facilitates fast and convenient calculation. A fully Bayesian approach is adopted to sample the model parameters in the transformed space, and posterior inference is performed after inverse-transforming the regression coefficients back to the original data domain. The proposed approach produces functional tests that flag local regions on the functional effects, while controlling the overall experiment-wise error rate or false discovery rate. It also enables functional discriminant analysis through posterior predictive calculation. Analysis of the fluorescence spectroscopy data reveals local regions with differential expressions across the pre-cancer and normal samples. These regions may serve as biomarkers for prognosis and disease assessment.","inCitations":["c2cac711189b0f096f3a98160739bba0deae8008","089f7ba8d16d8ad597a21453afdf923cc93fac8b","182b02062e13e1affac867c561ba6c5123229291","bcd4717bf26d4cd4c8deade7e79ab9d27ee79705","8d0efde210f318ebc8b5716adb0512308970ba53","8e47a70d21d8b3cd59a50a6fb8d25483ba5bbe5a"],"title":"Multivariate functional response regression, with application to fluorescence spectroscopy in a cervical pre-cancer study","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2017.02.004"}
