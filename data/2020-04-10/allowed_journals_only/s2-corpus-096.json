The systemic psychological perspective suggests, however, that many long-term phenomena are mutually interconnected, forming a dynamic system. Hence, only multivariate methods can handle such human dynamics appropriately. Unlike the majority of time series methodologies, the cointegration approach allows interdependencies of integrated (i.e., extremely unstable) processes to be modelled. This advantage results from the fact that cointegrated series are connected by stationary long-run equilibrium relationships. Vector error-correction models are frequently used representations of cointegrated systems. They capture both this equilibrium and compensation mechanisms in the case of short-term deviations due to developmental changes. Thus, the past disequilibrium serves as explanatory variable in the dynamic behaviour of current variables. Employing empirical data from cognitive psychology, psychosomatics, and marital interaction research, this paper describes how to apply cointegration methods to dynamic process systems and how to interpret the parameters under investigation from a psychological perspective.","inCitations":["38ad9d75840b73acc82ad886a076dfcd2e0192ae","bb6fdb2f8381b021508b5f7386989ee938f25d0e","957aed202866c73c533b00d3d0ea4ccab64f92ee","309fdb39b1c1932329820a04bf780f0e45b39ba8","3b672541579d412c08efbf9d60f47113538afafe"],"title":"Cointegration methodology for psychological researchers: An introduction to the analysis of dynamic process systems.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02033.x"}

When a latent linear regression is of interest, the contribution to power by the maximal reliability coefficient, which is associated with used latent variable indicators, is examined and this relationship is further explicated in the case of congeneric measures. It is also shown that item parcelling may reduce power of tests of latent regression parameters. Recommendations on weights for parcelling to avoid power loss are provided, which are found to be those of optimal linear composites with maximal reliability.","inCitations":["74a77fc7f507253fbcfc30b7959cca6cf5a072e6","54fb7f5c29883c97a8121bb7c31d2f934d855519"],"title":"Maximal reliability and power in covariance structure models.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X68183"}

Existing methods for analyzing such data in a factorial design are reviewed and new methods are developed with a special emphasis on pre- and post-treatment responses. The distribution of a square table is decomposed into successively independent pairs of discordant vectors, and assuming a logistic model, a statistics is computed to measure the shift in the marginal distributions. The approach is similar to McCullagh's approach (1). Two other criteria are proposed, one based on a Lehmann alternative used for comparing two distribution functions and the other based on a proportional odds model. These criteria are applied to the marginal distributions of a square table. For each case, a statistic measuring lack of marginal homogeneity and its variance are computed for each independent square table of a factorial design. Given such statistics, one can estimate a set of linear contrasts and compute its dispersion matrix for making inference. A numerical example is given.","inCitations":["aa32afdc51e33e6cbd8094c64f87d92501258492"],"title":"Analysis of paired ordered categorical data in a factorial design.","doi":"10.1080/10543409608835119"}

With the widely accepted use of the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis dataset as the primary analysis dataset for the analysis of controlled clinical trial data, the presence of missing data could lead to complicated data analysis strategies and subsequently to controversy in the interpretation of trial results. In this article, we review the mechanisms of missing data and some common approaches to analyzing missing data with an emphasis on study dropouts. We discuss the importance of understanding the reasons for study dropouts with ways to assess the mechanisms of missingness. Finally, we discuss the results of a comparative Monte Carlo investigation of the performance characteristics of commonly utilized statistical methods for the analysis of clinical trial data with dropouts. The methods investigated include the mixed effects model for repeated measurements (MMRM), weighted and unweighted generalized estimating equations (GEE) method for the available case data, multiple-imputation-based GEE (MI-GEE), complete case (CC) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and last observation carried forward (LOCF) ANCOVA. Simulation experiments for the repeated measures model with missing at random (MAR) dropout, under varying dropout rates and intrasubject correlation, show that the LOCF, ANCOVA, and weighted GEE methods perform poorly in terms of percent relative bias for estimating a difference in means effect, while the MI-GEE and weighted GEE methods both have less power for rejecting a zero difference in means hypothesis.","inCitations":["ed55222b268ac56eaeeb19cfef83cb89cc5aac57","d771416e5d71928467324e124bbdae07d38ee144","25612269e16e9e8e524e0035d2fcd4c3b936c2a2","4bb9542c2f3028c2906a7c93be8a7e32f0220fb2","9f6674b23082de815fe96c864796e388aab33f03","6acedad2fa1f6e8d0f24d2cda65e448a55d4dcd6","ab6f054c0106ec21e74c3beda75f44ec675e93b1","61da8d0973a163f4f55527be952d1c0b581a8c13","fd2e14a5bf951cc2537bd007743239ce52e713cb","68389ff89bd32b642a34c4de0aacddadfccd6978","c09652be663693b713f2f9a0487e6811a1ad73b0","464af9b069311316e2e10af2be7b3fb410f8d9a3","b457d0d78c5e088f8e5eafc9f2de6c07f7c06c38","351b403292d46f726ff7866b0c18986a497698de","f10f5bc72b92133935b4b4f35f27a5465ebce7c3","ea61201d137011b62c90f2c369d3efef87e53371","2486a18ed286c11ff1def056eb09b050604b41ee","2728863f74611955b904e6212c133608afbf6efa","e0ecc24c7a3105a60ede1b8b1c61fe8443d23776","d06a696deb4050cf22480ffeb42bb9d2a4daf902","a842b7b235f97dab21fd929ebf2edcf70f402d5f","0719645d6e32030171630ca2135c70b76c6dad64","dfa630533fa249a0cfcffae02302a7749c52f2ad","13af64544678013e0d897d90be430776e5ef2e91","3401402fd7090794fba6bb4ef12e2b7e18a0e4ae","2a15b1630bafaab2cec23e85815a2ec8810e4fb0","2d61221e75aaa1478e2530dc096ece823b5a3507","80d0c3569c60cb5fb2b1669653509d97419a5d44","43cbc9cf25aa3ecd0868f96ffaf12d411f3e04ee","5dda4fb69d809bd7a45f85f0f12392b0c5bab8c2","757187dd898c251600ff5aef3d577267886ada3e","b2025554a2d323be36a8e405d079c53a26516eb7","45bfdd84cd5042758fee7c9d5ec5f95d04d2fac0","3837a0b4cc64aa2ef3d3286bf6566cb7ceb2d91c","36c3fde07797833ed5a3b98a6ddf9b399772d817","3ad17e5dd362d1c11b9ae53e9dda782f0ab3040c","79a620d44ea31e816655bd872f23a3a822f27f81","86ef50ee7d36fe6be53c52f5bbedd678543232a8","c60ca4151cd29d0777d49babb66a1b9b6019b625","665436b96dd4d2e43b7608a06bb13d5657e74c1f","560c5b4902b54b7c568ab9308a2017a218954a63","53ddd3d5389982c89135cfea475b5a618d2bf77e","5c6a60c1c0a8b4431cfa84449350a6af7d9d8be9","4adcf54f827861e487dde13a1dfde6c41604d933","30c03755c7a39ac647b0b504e8854467c59dd8a0","fef6c5c0ad543f9fd98b44c9fe9ac51c531f54f7","40cbbdede5674bb797cdbb2329b8adb462039c36","57202c7a18ae262cadcc69b86b5a4a130a11d544","d99f35864dbbd1c1733b7276c11abbf945a09f6e","80b68bbc9dea6ed8c54993bb0d96dd3dd71c320e","7586e1e4ad5bf1dceba25f09fa1c27114599185c","3c92ab5df6aa788bb4867e8ad75bad9378a25e71","1c3bddbc76185739ce12f9f5b5a3afb4b9615b6d","2a45bd17602f62267a1ade3882a915f81aece246","7e086704750bf90f7e1560d0f976d8b6687f475f","b0bb3f7e8811a3be359ade8a4bcf07c1207a08f2","eb9a50f7b5b5149dcef9f3031d7b97ad98e122f9","5bbb37fd36a22123b3cb74d33f780e4ecb35855a","07d733f1940d2f3b91b2d1c1ac7606e3027af0cd","4a8560ed579065c41ab180e05d83d3ea9540b58f","6ec06f3597d8c5167d03f39bd3eded06179691e3","9416bc2738fe5e5f10bb9c9c81e06c2b582c1e4d","bdf8f62261828bfd7973ef4f6ce3155717d1e5bf","b8a70aee24400d6b319b09f8973629f7493a8889","f144a23e6b6e8298e41acf3bcb4b68ca598522af"],"title":"An overview of practical approaches for handling missing data in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903242795"}

Estimates of recollection declined over a 14-day period, but estimates of familiarity remained constant, suggesting that the processes are independent. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to report their confidence in their recognition decisions. Subjective reports of confidence were analysed via receiver operating characteristics and also indicated different rates of decline for recollection and familiarity. Superficially, the data appear to support a dual-process account of recognition, but close inspection shows the data to be consistent with a simple signal detection model. The conclusion is that although the phenomenal experience of remembering changes over time this is most likely to be predicated on a single process.","inCitations":["f2e714d1146d1a4900b47031b93612a811833cce","a77222133977c9c71fca6d50f041404e9348c550","52e96f800bbececdcc8001db21420dbf2bb6ab01","a2f1b85c88886f5c6f1ecf1de414c721dc749510","dda31f3e4e3a9a5888b321d602106c5e85526a08","a9dbd6bf66b4ddb9a6b943f0ee5248788fa8d106","41ada734c8d6114a7981d13e0be5f3e1d185fcb7","a076d415b14906182e79bb67f73c364471c7077f","c945cec8426d2235782159371997cb842d471287"],"title":"Do changes in the subjective experience of recognition over time suggest independent processes?","doi":"10.1348/000711009X416416"}

We use simulation to choose a signal detection threshold, and illustrate some effective graphics for displaying the flagged signals.","inCitations":["5624295eebbaa7741a84a68a5056b2e7121f3829","b56a68ce78ff23fbb597ad1e6ce1f0113943d4b9","0ea08f6150e89912a3154959eefe7fb21070633f","926ecb6f9051269b94f448ae3ffb3c74288c1e40","d103e26ce4b43a049f0e75ded81659960e135d23","cc56eee031c0c393373f511535238ccd9612c331","49f9d03a94318f7a567824207e62b1e9948913eb","8e6e6db71b329456d3c6fce18e25ea7138d72950","9d8cde236ed45c0529d544285d442535018ce245","f4a6355207b283778aa2b1f7c8f23191115e8a4c","47a1c08cbb8b572e67221410ab64484e88c0a565","fd12334b38f0d38f9b101a6a2cd04e05d17a0733","deca321378e3f8f11c9eebfe2c4c1a4f67f40231","93ddd15c61384d3c6b2d01f5565075cda8e4d774","f796a81098ec78b67b87ddc6ceeefc3cc47311d1","175a5bc8e720214f0028dc39bb9373c477920003"],"title":"Bayesian hierarchical modeling for detecting safety signals in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.520181"}

They also noted that standard Cox software may be used to fit the model provided that the potential censoring times are known for individuals observed to experience a competing event (‘censoring complete data’) and that otherwise an inverse probability of censoring weighting method can be used. Beyersmann and Schumacher (2008) extended the methods of Fine and Gray (1999) to allow for random time-dependent covariates. Shortly after the paper by Beyersmann and Schumacher, Ruan and Gray (2008) suggested a multiple imputation approach for fitting a subdistribution hazards model. The aim of the imputation is to recover the potential censoring times for individuals with an observed competing event. Then standard Cox software may again be used for the analysis, which allows for including time-dependent covariates. We note that the MI approach also allows the fitting of stratified models and frailty models using standard software. We have written an R-package kmi that both implements the multiple imputation procedure and contains a random sample of the censoring complete data used by Beyersmann and Schumacher. The package can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network at http://cran.r-project.org. Table 1 reports the analyses either using multiple imputation, with 10 multiple imputations, or using the original censoring complete information for both the random subsample and the whole data set.","inCitations":["3676f9f633fc0a447e9eb595184019f458b80594","92b1e14058be4bd9c0abc94e25b1dca3b62ca671","22ecdb417b724468b1da07a5d6ce16ad2c8718e5","d6eab57e548b6a74a3bbbfbac630a013fcf723a6","5437df683446cf1bca57c8ef431018d06bf88e58","99ff52c9b9673f1be2e9f48bc54285035ee93b55","68b164c05fe6dac5ed595725078106f2ef8f0df7"],"title":"Software for fitting nonstandard proportional subdistribution hazards models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq018"}

Multiple gene profiling studies have been conducted for such a purpose. Genomic markers identified from the analysis of single datasets often do not have satisfactory reproducibility. Among the multiple possible reasons, the most important one is the small sample sizes of individual studies. A cost-effective solution is to pool data from multiple comparable studies and conduct integrative analysis. In this study, we collect four breast cancer prognosis studies with gene expression measurements. We describe the relationship between prognosis and gene expressions using the accelerated failure time (AFT) models. We adopt a 2-norm group bridge penalization approach for marker identification. This integrative analysis approach can effectively identify markers with consistent effects across multiple datasets and naturally accommodate the heterogeneity among studies. Statistical and simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory performance of this approach. Breast cancer prognosis markers identified using this approach have sound biological implications and satisfactory prediction performance.","inCitations":["1e3dbf91b522b57ee3006197bc420d7bfdb875fa","77207a631784742f1bdd714e3445a0a2046564e8"],"title":"Identification of breast cancer prognosis markers via integrative analysis","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2012.02.017"}

RNA-sequencing data take the form of counts, so models based on the Gaussian distribution are unsuitable. Moreover, normalization is challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads. To overcome these difficulties, we use a log-linear model with a new approach to normalization. We derive a novel procedure to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class, or multiple-class outcomes, and the computation is fast even for large data sets. We study the accuracy of our approaches for significance calculation and FDR estimation, and we demonstrate that our method has potential advantages over existing methods that are based on a Poisson or negative binomial model. In summary, this work provides a pipeline for the significance analysis of sequencing data.","inCitations":["70abae53a08a21c0a90e92e9fdc71ee7a7767dbb","4c13d4ee1616c0ed8e16019ae06d9285df7df21f","e5449d37500e9333dfeb6a7d808b9d3ced86fb66","499c819c6a2f00dfac10ec86e152ea51598029b7","487785b81fc2db64557be2957422e77680a0b9e9","75b8bf3156f8470555190d92662347f7506c3b29","f8c14b9226dbddb507bfd61afa8fa7dc65406116","d8aa9650d7eb4a6fe41fcdfd3539869a9e9bf9a6","431f692c4b4fe01ca463551f9569713375714f2f","7d6283f5dfb145a80fc993be7a329968db4bf629","66d80625401d3fa1e366edcc057191aa7ef741a5","fb7e113bcb27e313b329aaaba5edff27a19cd043","0f01ed6cf280623cd602216738b3249604ecb57d","c2c54518bb4ddb32627ecb5195a327351e815657","eb8967dfe9b5f44b209d1204b03c83445444da68","b5e63fe580f7862d6e58b57968012673287f716c","b36019f58b43d7a46156f069d6c83d07bcab947a","4b7de50dd7395a25fb00ede19efffe6126b52318","3591df9684f7566b26f0beaf83e0e474eef3d320","4f3ce51b24acecaf67ef8bbeb1725aba1d5c5eee","76930b41035775e900b44dfe756a4584151e9afe","a092f61cf5a2b55fdbb0e3322e56f33c4783a5b4","731178dd9a5bf7e436294a6c78a59244cb32b58d","a8a76440805fd5d73ed40e75741404b43a592b3c","c8590a17fb3badfaf6691683b677796914ca61dd","fefe2d5a8563942a9a3fc3c0703b49b979715856","003b1f6600d15c1c8baa7b0f5fdc418a110a1559","8487e7ca38107a43bf973a6c5e57793ad142640f","7d6ba2db0bc9fbcc23579b03761db25e787a41a5","0a874e06256b70f967fd4d96675e61264c387fd5","d8ece35215ebd5fb576f77b39cb1def30577f98d","2dcc572a055f64b1831322e1d60fa291e509aeba","6e5688da5ec782c3ccd69c2b3ee5698aee24b74e","a155f423f91448963e0dd543fe1d6e273f50e965","01ebfbf4932c809f079cbfccb2d784133c710b02","3c0f17df0c494761690d58e15afac2360beaffc6","2883ba6844321ff1f321f24c661311b9344a91b0","2f266a4bbc4cad8a06188f7ebac7a8c38a02bf32","43e543e528e5cc53a2ec3ee432a41a99fbec4e27","ce8cfbf90d734b1b1b0fc903b7727b0303a81f5e","dcd11ad4a2e97e655c5046ed3981139c0666871e","bffc9536b9a6a9ee847c3b75413a71daef7e3228","0321277baa8f925d687c6cc1826c6ba132fa6b14","b2b51bf5a54d7ecbc2b859cfd91f79c937084422","1fd3dce14583e7ab55b5c5d3b92a1a518f072695","951f115a1bd807d987adb7ddd86e5c2cc088bd84","f985eeee9695773ac649dc01b47d5d06f7accc8b","161eabcbda99ae007133b2312c10881afecd247b","2674c464baa74d071e657a78480a22424e99bab7","bd6bb5a35f1582c19f2e45f1d895b32660206a17","68aa60a39a7b8ed0a9760d45965974d667c9869a","a66411bee32cb00548b542b80d0815f157f2aaf9","43594d54f1a28490c37609ce0d0277702748f3cb","1aac54cadafc1f4069f511414dc7cb6a13f90ea4","fc1b0d326cbdfb49510a28dc4c3cf1a5bf19f343","00308fd3a89f3258700969d05e2a3a93bc978e05","248c1508387133393281681f41a02e6f1873b430","b7fe9d2975b933dceae87d970bd37cb233f144cc","92c72d6acd9513d5fa20bed95774ac9d8dab3605","c09f0c4111f018d028a75c7565340f25af86b840","45820922e03a16d02d604624a1d9816b06bf256d","c18bc9f53efa810dc59efc9965d0a2cf71f6a812","5a800e93631e7c3cad42cc3e1b0c590b16c52f33","9cbe1b0ea6c949dff0eabddb2a21eda35a159a76","9535bfd238503546ef66c766609f032bd68d7e8f","7e5f0fb72d6c53d0d91cfb6dd3c4a78ca3a4f6ff","a614b910bc430161433978cd6a9af7e3398909d9","01cf37f00c7c44803477716cbb9c27c099ed1866","a57e020e902a14ab5bb3a95cfcfdffc5db5e9e0c","d1d6a675197da4a3dad107f0a68b9f783d097743","e3216b3bcb674779fefd44b0f95bbdf3d31cdc22","5f77ad401d5400d03e1e1d7cddff4c2e153d14b0","d4da4f6d2138f09b41a8fce7470e13c157dfcce2","6d7e93c41fda1fa79702923be6cfcdddd8b4554b","34860ccfae1329f5d4ac9630d4bed0f3e444d063","2e2f73edb1aaafb1b41188185a21b81107b6fb05","11296fcd432b8808db025f10bafc24af53e1cc14","9a4fb7666588d6f9768faa57de4659b112bdf7ec","ad8c26c0e56f6f955070fb1a54e5227c8192c394","b517ec9fa6d099a5e0ad73a657f93e139e477dca","37573fdabf35cb001064447289b02bc42b7aebf2","0e915517070e5515003da2b677ec6d6e0304a1a1","d0aa7b9bedad4b82e4373cf7afdc2eea05fcbd49","66cec4e51b54c9fb93a2aca0917992e06f6c126b","e3676dbc5742777a72afe322d3a12cd88678c7b9","161b6a4c644413ade4cf2cc66daa18aaf38f9332","ef8df0ba9455d05c85a3fd2910a863f381645dad","5f66a617b6e7dd5b8a82a371768b12202ad482fa","e76dcf429cb511166e04a137a8f703cc8b13ead8","32f9e32abd229a15749fc5b692f148e8135fdf6b","ba87e09099e73070efc5f8b93572153b32bd2e82"],"title":"Normalization, testing, and false discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr031"}

Potential factors for defining subgroups include gender, age, disease severity, and geographic region. A major statistical issue for the interpretation of treatment comparisons for subgroups is whether the role of a subgroup is inferential, supportive, or exploratory through respectively corresponding to a primary, key secondary, or hypothesis-generating assessment. This article discusses statistical planning to control type 1 error for the multiple comparisons that correspond to the scope of prespecified inferential subgroups, and it provides some suggestions for addressing the type 2 error that can pertain to prespecified supportive subgroups. Treatment comparisons for exploratory subgroups without a priori specification should always have a very cautious interpretation that accounts for how random variation can influence their pattern of results, although the suggested methods for supportive subgroups can be helpful in this light.","inCitations":["61bddeb32661a3a197c3babdc12ac962d50e5396","dd8c25f9a7aa53f18a06d5b34c4fa1191624e706","2822cd4f41962615b1ae6e1a8480a3c4afe1b33f","16194c938c76d5b3bd2a1715fa6e8f64b13e4e54","f651c7361f47a713316db592c7d9097919d07822","788c9dac9755474466623cb722a8aa16b603df73","48974ca900360335d316c629505804fb691e9b23"],"title":"An overview of statistical planning to address subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.856021"}

We applied this knowledge-based similarity metric to a clique-finding algorithm for detecting sets of related genes with biological classifications. We also combined it with an expression-based distance metric to produce a co-cluster analysis, which accentuates genes with both similar expression profiles and similar biological characteristics and identifies gene clusters that are more stable and biologically meaningful. These algorithms are demonstrated in the analysis of MPRO cell differentiation time series experiments.","inCitations":["5bdfcff22272e4bf9fc8209a353332820dbd5c30","9b10e887cf64460405f6c26c0c4bc0ae251e6594","1ce6f10e6627a3aa6891109d6044cb1a9d429261","6c0d0ebfcfc6f9beb7a5f368e1fbbf7450590172","bfea2fb4b653fb012d0cd94fb362343d7667c0e1","2f13f6d3a272a091ca5e7b8b28583477129ee6b6","ddfffd7043a0d5c3dd4115e8be50513130926671","4277672518b3da7ca34a4e8ce1603ed1c3629a6e","c16ee3bb0e19afe69a70a8bff818a7167f503b00","2ad0345fb4452d69c0e7a8b8ed9546d0dbb84e55","6cfd71779d62bbe39dfdd715be044013e5ad86f9","c1617e0a5a76302ab31adcafb41dd359f6ff54d7","12e2d29ac06f27529e5765f5d69b07aaa81eb769","079a2f537335dc5c575dc0d7fd399d4b59b682a0","e75ee0e1a67d85d504547b2fd6f15c3e94b34316","6506379578b1a3c1a322651ec765b71053ba931f","1071c7480756cfdaaf3f7fd9b6abf224e7d03810","4aa6fe25b5af97bf59374e897f08f7f9effbebee","831f0040cc6dde48abd0387187b53bf5b2e8f69d","d8bd989ae135a148e3d45166dded8a59975b641e","0564ffa39c9ec0b8f2addafa7c3b2a0ae20a9dd5","dde91c83bb0248323d6e2b414e7fd7b3dfe986b0","01a84590ad4726aad57eec123f7ef720ec95c44e","26f5c3a627227054c96ae792d747702d4be95d61","fd09e0e9d9e6878622f83b94f42c86e26ed6444e","b8db00be1f1ee885c475bb8b379b2db7d951ba79","29d0cd68638f9cf3fef17f98f0b1fb871d852d2c","a1a752436585f9f73807b7bffa2f198502fab625","11c5929835196771c21116a70ccc2a81b0454047","9610c6856c8ea330f1cb15cac19bdf556b391053","249ad6ff349030111aa5b82adf81319797e3152c","a8efcb7676b9985011f4081e77adfe7de0e6d751","4ef2283574936d3923f064be2093e3c3f0a1f626","2db791bf11004e7b3557cb101aafd043532d1938","3c22a970c00e44dda4023878e996d75a7507247c","85649f5f0ff4bc1253aa7fee1ee474b1ced55c26","7af0b88112fd59cf4796c332fd98ce7f88486e3c","6cb4376eef6f9547bd2b2caca685b5a4078a0784","914de42a27f9d48fe7bf2e481e9babd93f56fb72","71e64dcec08e4c672acfa6645d2888430a5736be","f432d10a5b4aac746291e07dcc04d132533a0eee","88cf613b8eccf597eef922c2f70c2d34399306e0","908d5dc2119de4311ebe2b3fcfd570e40c14ac5e","a63d7ef3e9c8eefe374bfc3822e71d08e8594c1f","a6fa4f8e8b62e8c43b29aea6cdf8a92a329e7f90","784cbb81ee7123361a5689bf40c0646a7d462d82","a39aeb761ebb755fd4d0a42378322e134f043f4c","f9e3abe614400895c4be88ed5b7ce0d2b10527ae","0b450553665677121d19b2f933358bceb0dc1cbb","db9ff2561b873b4c1acb8af3f0d596fd45bb1e44","3380721ce580d535b52b659d8cabeac23ee61a5b","7c44b5062b5c56c38355bb4cf74ba218c4003378","b73a75a05fd3e7ebc99389c9710ef705741116e8","408422cc68f3aedab2233f75153423a1bd4c63b9","b3181a9007f9c70bc0a9a130a872ab23caf981b5","e1ea9b8edf12d4c3c75278cf1343df57e837cb2c","6c264bf97aa6478793b91b17bccdda9c5df76a21","bc7dd72b63b05c204f58e28045d5696e97a664b2","7b51f6d56289c6a1c9026c62639efc8674fb7844","f1d2cef588a31ea70f8e60fad278b3152b3cfbe9","b882ef598555ddc81fe599ca8dd9def4179cd901","f508b0eb7c84eb499e7fcd75440f80da8f4e1b38","64567ed9d2a9349cc52633fca22e474b37bae5fd","153c2db44cf0c45010a6e229236f106472e700a3","0529dc8bf6fe473cbe9a6cb04738e9b55dcf69d4","079b4a023b07df979f20d543df60004dcca0630c","89e39ce9d4cb8ccf721fa3088841af498849cdbb","49e84a0e09d9150372eeb2dea04066394465f8be","e797f84c24868d47170050ff69959aa7e5ed0b32","1c98be19a80a5eb22bb42e9b4b02aa07ed014b2d","844bbbb60464cf01d787de041ffa2b2065a88188","e648319d7cf87280cfea9029e8bd2ec6b19210be","1521501920ac905015b3f323dc846da29e62c622","da14218b28bc8d52e722550d3d1302ddb8ec2855","21280a63b436ccdd7559b572be08c8d366e6e41f","f234b5a71548dbf44fb9656b5305b9a75b8a1e87","0b91ec7c2e0b4020fa5980c7f80189befa11af2f","f8e85d85900813e8fd4f2287ef767c1c5432e767","0ec1a89b34a21446857bd7ae59376f3c60a502a6","27fcfa0c4426db28996872a44576111b4e77cf2e","1fb8b1963593ba5733414c7292ae7e688b563b88","71c638bceab962630588e7c8338a71d870a1f418","6b366cc4d66e802711e84e8a0441d5357f6e33c0","0de76d37f54311c71ff6766cdcc2720c01e8e005","b45555244073cdd463a8cc10e4e4660bdf8919cd","a8c737da8b9406dc53fd498ec39f9f866b9a4901","e9104349b32d73ef812efbab046029161a503546","5e7b9147e5137d810008e98680b2f4c439e28a70"],"title":"A knowledge-based clustering algorithm driven by Gene Ontology.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200025659"}

The support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully applied to microarray cancer diagnosis problems. However, one weakness of the SVM is that given a tumor sample, it only predicts a cancer class label but does not provide any estimate of the underlying probability. We propose penalized logistic regression (PLR) as an alternative to the SVM for the microarray cancer diagnosis problem. We show that when using the same set of genes, PLR and the SVM perform similarly in cancer classification, but PLR has the advantage of additionally providing an estimate of the underlying probability. Often a primary goal in microarray cancer diagnosis is to identify the genes responsible for the classification, rather than class prediction. We consider two gene selection methods in this paper, univariate ranking (UR) and recursive feature elimination (RFE). Empirical results indicate that PLR combined with RFE tends to select fewer genes than other methods and also performs well in both cross-validation and test samples. A fast algorithm for solving PLR is also

These models are used to analyze data presenting multiple hierarchical levels of grouping (cluster data, clinical trials with several observation periods, ...). The variability of the individual parameters of the regression function is thus decomposed as a between-subject variability and higher levels of variability (e.g. within-subject variability). We propose maximum likelihood estimates of parameters of those MNLMEMs with 2 levels of random effects, using an extension of the stochastic approximation version of expectation-maximization (SAEM)-Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithm. The extended SAEM algorithm is split into an explicit direct expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and a stochastic EM part. Compared to the original algorithm, additional sufficient statistics have to be approximated by relying on the conditional distribution of the second level of random effects. This estimation method is evaluated on pharmacokinetic crossover simulated trials, mimicking theophylline concentration data. Results obtained on those data sets with either the SAEM algorithm or the first-order conditional estimates (FOCE) algorithm (implemented in the nlme function of R software) are compared: biases and root mean square errors of almost all the SAEM estimates are smaller than the FOCE ones. Finally, we apply the extended SAEM algorithm to analyze the pharmacokinetic interaction of tenofovir on atazanavir, a novel protease inhibitor, from the Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le Sida 107-Puzzle 2 study. A significant decrease of the area under the curve of atazanavir is found in patients receiving both treatments.","inCitations":["a5b43402afb604ec65f11af1df73fb3acb09127b","fa67b175f17b00d9717dfc8d84e726be1d3db26e","4e0a7330f6512516fb9295873af2305251a1a7a5","73da34247e9b57e6729943aba861e7c022d9c9c6","eb5af8052290af472bb31d44b5ed7d1a8514b087","09c4e38c788ff37e1d42df31f5506e510f2d7cdd","aed6ea734723a9d0f5c17306eeaf89499d249988","ed245ab3ae93594f57abdaa146c1beb68c1b32e1","d87b6a657ea101dd380eb61ea45beeade9e4e5fc","a643c4b2f95250be87dc8c7cf2bf1bfaaebaa36b","fa7de3807820fe316bdfcba9f3b2ebd20f8f03d5","099888e003da4101ed9be659ca749fade31a098c","24b916e4d7aeb2b5c2bc9598f49faca9d4f807cf","3b90320aa1c9ead8b78455eddb081e24f575f25c","6c05edc988afb0df336882a50df56e7532a705f8","68765be5fdd94b850d2d34d21c6d96785522e3f1","198e827b63111a8468937e3774828dd4102a6469","12574fd8453e78d09256a3117d13f439fc1ef2db"],"title":"Extension of the SAEM algorithm for nonlinear mixed models with 2 levels of random effects.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn020"}
