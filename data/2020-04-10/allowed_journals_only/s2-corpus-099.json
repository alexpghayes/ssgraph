Assuming validation data are available, we propose a Bayesian approach to correct cost-effectiveness studies for unmeasured confounding.

A wide range of approaches in dealing with this issue exist, such as excluding data without a variance measure, using a function of sample size as a weight and imputing the missing standard errors/deviations. A non-linear mixed effects modelling approach was taken to describe the time-course of standard deviations across 14 studies. The model was then used to make predictions of the missing standard deviations, thus, enabling a precision weighted model-based meta-analysis of a mean pain endpoint over time. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches were implemented with example code to illustrate how this imputation can be carried out and to compare the output from each method. The resultant imputations were nearly identical for the two approaches. This modelling approach acknowledges the fact that standard deviations are not necessarily constant over time and can differ between treatments and across studies in a predictable way.","inCitations":["32968625c8d5d31ce77633198391a63b44b9e724","bde0456b8f1653b9e4b555b7f4b3aa811c25725a","de2425c56c9d4f36d3f0f9e1e1f1976dc8f2bb84","0bed2a3291e7187198937f565ddb6fa25cb990d2","a46bccd13235d2875b7b5659ce1e31c9421307de"],"title":"Imputation of missing variance data using non-linear mixed effects modelling to enable an inverse variance weighted meta-analysis of summary-level longitudinal data: a case study.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1515"}

Our method allows the potential effects of longitudinal trajectories on the health risks to vary and accumulate over time. We further utilize the proposed methods to narrow the critical time windows of increased health risks. We find that high residual variation of FSH is a strong predictor of hot flash risk, and that the high cumulative changes of the FSH mean trajectories in the 52.5-55 year age range also provides evidence of increased risk above and beyond that of short-term FSH residual variation by itself.","inCitations":["8db154f1f024904d8eeaa4d618b6b1dd5d31a99d","cbf24f4e57aefa9cceedff4ea4f51fb9edd16140","44e6e4c4d503cff1af1abb558b4be3f02043d5ca","07dcde86f8c10a2a19d2d50fca2c93033811b50c","5f19b48eb4e039be7473e6ac11dde968b12cdf78"],"title":"Modeling Short- and Long-Term Characteristics of Follicle Stimulating Hormone as Predictors of Severe Hot Flashes in Penn Ovarian Aging Study.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12102"}

We argue that the normal approximation is not always able to adequately capture the underlying uncertainty of the original discrete data. Furthermore, when we examine the influence of the prior distributions considered, in the presence of rare events, the results from this approximation can be very poor. In order to assess the robustness of the quantities of interest in meta-analysis with respect to the choice of priors, this paper proposes an alternative Bayesian model for binomial random variables with several zero responses. Particular attention is paid to the coherence between the prior distributions of the study model parameters and the meta-parameter. Thus, our method introduces a simple way to examine the sensitivity of these quantities to the structure dependence selected for study. For illustrative purposes, an example with real data is analysed, using the proposed Bayesian meta-analysis model for binomial sparse data.

We use the type A weighted Z-test to exemplify the variance spending approach in the first part of this manuscript. This approach has been applied to sample size re-estimation. In the second part of the manuscript, we introduce the type B weighted Z-tests and apply them to the design of bridging studies. The weights in the type A weighted Z-tests are pre-determined, independent of the prior observed data, and controls alpha at the desired level. To the contrary, the weights in the type B weighted Z-tests may depend on the prior observed data; and the type I error rate for the bridging study is usually inflated to a level higher than that of a full-scale study. The choice of the weights provides a simple statistical framework for communication between the regulatory agency and the sponsor. The negotiation process may involve practical constrains and some characteristics of prior studies.","inCitations":["f9aa37f7b6c052dbb872ed36d9b5e4c2c1a35f5b","a146dad1cf294f3445f4f400bd251e22512a42e5","e7089a226f31fcecae8edc7193bd9cf2341bbf19","c404d0b04d3fe310103e153c20b7eb763dd872b5","4456faf0c19e3bfe40bccbb86528d04b81bf3ee2","6d5a070e803b4231197c64c0c2096e2ef9438e1f","f2d50a09e063f9de6ca2b1e1c45fb17e5ce3d8a4","ad625b4480f0f602cb049b42bcc205ce8988c17b","6e965d1082207efc94a8d6a0b36e21669119f976","270f30e853cd43fabc0ffab560f4dc6a9f7345e2","e241c9719f9e052d29eef8b3e90ae11b62f6a5c5"],"title":"The use of weighted Z-tests in medical research.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200062284"}

We used two and three-parameter pharmacokinetic models with fixed and mixed effects and two Bayesian optimal design criteria, namely ED and API, using different error weighting schemes. We found that by increasing the magnitude of the uncertainty, in most cases, additional design points appear, compared to the corresponding local design, and this happens gradually, forming bifurcation patterns. These bifurcation patterns were interpreted as high sensitivity of the design from the magnitude of the uncertainty.","inCitations":["a8ed01c4cc6cfd4cc1cf17fc6849b26f8f33dd13","588e46ee04aa364f803b05eaaaeaa92bdde2c76a","c63eb6069f0d8209c45ed11124612615cecb29bd","6a6a1e4ec0ff33118ec0875902b1263427e29701","9a8211d314f0f6d77c83e9134178846622898a88","759493112ba4aa2491e4fec9ac2cebacc3ce9c43","54833a3dd441812c72ee92177f147781f2c75adf","a362cf62eda75b3764eba6324740ebd7588b82cc"],"title":"Bayesian optimal designs for pharmacokinetic models: sensitivity to uncertainty.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701514007"}

Although more advanced clustering algorithms are available, the simplicity and visual appeal of hierarchical clustering has made it ubiquitous in gene expression data analysis. Hence, even minor improvements in this framework would have significant impact. There is currently no simple and systematic way of assessing and displaying the significance of various clusters in a resulting dendrogram without making certain distributional assumptions or ignoring gene-specific variances. In this work, we introduce a permutation test based on comparing the within-cluster structure of the observed data with those of sample datasets obtained by permuting the cluster membership. We carry out this test at each node of the dendrogram using a statistic derived from the singular value decomposition of variance matrices. The p-values thus obtained provide insight into the significance of each cluster division. Given these values, one can also modify the dendrogram by combining non-significant branches. By adjusting the cut-off level of significance for branches, one can produce dendrograms with a desired level of detail for ease of interpretation. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to illustrative data sets.","inCitations":["7beddde427d8334d84bb4e64c453bd90a70a39aa","7f7de176954eddc4af65372e5308fa4fd7f1d535","690f8fef88f2ddad0c8c03c9016135bd9892e3fb","8fd7c63a9e5947df5ce913e7382ad812679c586b","cd9907aa8a3b918e01a550c65929290649171e1b","157099580ec51cdfea49e2a102acef2cc1347362","786205c6d10d7e3a869a7b40dc2d05edf379f40d","67bd11f6f37cb0499ee78784efe27c7a60788889","fda15289e96552b8f4cb883d5b80b94a00ccaeed","4d90fc31a968c2d617c3029d77d0f47a29ee14c5","2032e0d6dfe7992d4208e8af0196aa44a06aa4c4","20fd108d50293e9ca99da0c8f372fd93249920b8","d233874fb4eb5dca00f0102639d8eff3994b3464"],"title":"A permutation test for determining significance of clusters with applications to spatial and gene expression data","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2009.05.031"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2014,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"As an important aspect of the clinical evaluation of an investigational therapy, safety data are routinely collected in clinical trials. To date, the analysis of safety data has largely been limited to descriptive summaries of incidence rates or contingency tables aiming to compare simple rates between treatment arms. Many have argued that this traditional approach failed to take into account important information including severity, onset time, and multiple occurrences of a safety event. In addition, premature treatment discontinuation due to excessive toxicity causes informative censoring and may lead to potential bias in the interpretation of safety events. In this article, we propose a framework to summarize safety data with mean frequency function and compare safety events of interest between treatments with a generalized log-rank test, taking into account the aforementioned characteristics ignored in traditional analysis approaches. In addition, a multivariate generalized log-rank test to compare the overall safety profile of different treatments is proposed. In the proposed method, safety events are considered to follow a recurrent event process with a terminal event for each patient. The terminal event is modeled by a process of two types of competing risks: safety events of interest and other terminal events. Statistical properties of the proposed method are investigated via simulations. An application is presented with data from a phase II oncology trial.","inCitations":["dcf4d3c109485ec51a58135396e05579956605f0","1d64d00afb5b942c1d5ee098681a5d786eec9246","62352c30d7eb327041313b485b2230e96c83d5c2"],"title":"Analysis of safety data in clinical trials using a recurrent event approach.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1611"}

These features are (1) the shape of the dose-response curve, (2) the median effective dose and (3) the minimum effective dose level. A main difficulty of this task is that an optimal design for a single objective may not perform well for other objectives. There are optimal designs for dual objectives in the literature but we were unable to find optimal designs for 3 or more objectives to date with a concrete application. A reason for this is that the approach for finding a dual-objective optimal design does not work well for a 3 or more multiple-objective design problem. We propose a method for finding multiple-objective optimal designs that estimate the three features with user-specified higher efficiencies for the more important objectives. We use the flexible 4-parameter logistic model to illustrate the methodology but our approach is applicable to find multiple-objective optimal designs for other types of objectives and models. We also investigate robustness properties of multiple-objective optimal designs to mis-specification in the nominal parameter values and to a variation in the optimality criterion. We also provide computer code for generating tailor made multiple-objective optimal designs.","inCitations":["130966208c8227c4ac634a888b77246ea6b1707a","952108d3b9575f70a3fbf07368c90b28e7778a46"],"title":"Multiple-Objective Optimal Designs for Studying the Dose Response Function and Interesting Dose Levels","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0044"}

Here, we propose a multivariate phylogenetic latent liability model for assessing the correlation between multiple types of data, while simultaneously controlling for their unknown shared evolutionary history informed through molecular sequences. The latent formulation enables us to consider in a single model combinations of continuous traits, discrete binary traits, and discrete traits with multiple ordered and unordered states. Previous approaches have entertained a single data type generally along a fixed history, precluding estimation of correlation between traits and ignoring uncertainty in the history. We implement our model in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework, and discuss inference techniques for hypothesis testing. Finally, we showcase the method through applications to columbine flower morphology, antibiotic resistance in Salmonella, and epitope evolution in influenza.","inCitations":["c068bc053afea5cf7426b93bc366bef019ce0f1e","987091cde009fcb3e1710b29e8978bc1849124d7","582174f4431fa0efe265d96a56de475434f844b1","7504feb652abb4161ca04893c85c7ec99c76e907","af023c56307be7010bd91bce261b563352daa500","6ed072276764b8f3bb1299c61b8416310ddfbe60","4b170095aac77e0fb36ae7ac6db3cd98d599ba4a","ed51c7aefe0df2ac15a2747c3a3ee9815a66b12c","29551da2757b25681d9343c5013b5b2740acd86a","3be42f376283b0c122f901c341056c1f6f8e8c71","bf20e94960a14b0577876a3ca0774cdbc2293cc1","bb9d0f6001fabd293b8d61140d947d0b493e4fcc","af201bf99b22ebec09bbb234cd2cf780fe8c9c4b","bea150bd762d0c31d7e16063446970213ff36f0f","8a2f70e9981838bd27a04ed9cecae4951e6ba4f9","b7a232961ad7f6b81bb741cf6e1160442866c6aa","a9bc1e85ad1501380d20306c15e60c3040bc0607","0df1d3ea33b6c586547abb161a6ac30d2bb8f235"],"title":"Assessing Phenotypic Correlation through the Multivariate Phylogenetic Latent Liability Model.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS821"}

Specifically, the increase in a given regression model's R2 when one predictor is added was compared to the increase in the same model's R2 when another predictor is added. This comparison can be used to determine predictor importance and is the basis for procedures such as Dominance Analysis. Results indicate that the asymptotic procedure provides the expected coverage rates for sample sizes of 200 or more, but in many cases much higher sample sizes are required to achieve adequate power. Guidelines and computations are provided for the determination of adequate sample sizes for hypothesis testing.","inCitations":["e0ef7b80802482f6b0e8b4d54d2d560091949f86","1951faca0d1e5ae26b210ac1379d2a18d8131ef5","f2318d2e1c979af90ea14da9a17abe3b8ce620eb","3974c1fdaecc86a8d3492a952481e8c691129e56"],"title":"Comparing the squared multiple correlation coefficients of non-nested models: an examination of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X171970"}

To use these models entails dealing with hyperparameters in the deeper levels of a hierarchy. There are three typical methods for dealing with these hyperparameters: specify them, estimate them, or use a 'flat' prior. Each of these strategies has its own associated problems. In this paper, using an empirical Bayes approach, we show how the hyperparameters can be estimated in a way that is both computationally feasible and statistically valid.","inCitations":["9aa13c8b805196ae287fcac4eb55a8a8dbcf74f4","731ff88b887707c2819b0739fe587ff0b392c73f","aee0334a8285f90125019705c8928b597340c78d","be21658c4353da37faf51474a076b911a846ba19","dc94a258d396a2796acc2d351c0a19da8f820dcc","44279d26aae85d423ca9e7aa980096b289456093","f69996599ada5694e31b98822bc7cc0a1afbcf4a","df51c185ee1419a97375d2961e4a265693a6a0f5","514ebf8b25312cb5cac42a5f20f4a488397c4119","3cbd011a81263247fea8abf58a121fd81281b5b1","1e91d87bd5401ac3286fc173553ab6ccb8059d63","86a00d041f81bf51f1ceef785a15b483885ae437","a932b216e9ec269379ad4ec8a37323f3653c9c33","c1a2669bad397516c59eb193e1e898f655b9fa78","9fd55393a7d09eadb1f769642132436005a46b9b","5d0f9a2765131dfb1bfbfc58199294da338117ee","6c28c45a08091e1633290f9eaea92e1ee7401112","df5740857933dde1dbf271da934f9f65f368e8cd","ee7b67c451cf211711c8533f64e89c6261a328a8","13b9d0721d99a39f67c8e11527371d4c1db26e95","7c0405e3d80ff04824335275a50c5921feba10ba","c06f617f35ef583bb1cf7d719f4e981cece38a8a","6fce6a11e6d4a398ce11d8bd8c15d63f7487e2b9","bbbe1629a6a29c7fea8755b2f8bf148156e00a44","fb368aa58e7402613f7e57b10685ba0e3da97ea2","c5d3a39c5202dedc4d5b76311fac037de7e6ce69","1a236cfc250e8a0cb1ab97c516f076abb5dbf1bb","d3ef680d7fc63a7b74b8d085b883a464105dd0c5","01ef8188746b8dad22a57f9b4fdfb4d6d4922808","3ec1090b21299d4e8118763196013658baaf1d16","407d92fd7fdb2d678ea1eb59b993db568f944e57","bfd7edae8ed2253762dec3e44faebcebdc7457a2","5370cab0e6e149e0e2713fa9a34fdd75a93b95b1","3f9a5ef1dfb9e7f7c0a7a3fc82faecb1e1a49ca0","81871363c5bd26908699377161f0e172d8ce875b","15a38e9de903754448318692177e593992178c2b","831ac263da0054ddd531dd0fff9e7c607b166158","14a08c71f93bec9f0c691d98406ee270d2c522a1","85dca15bbf1eb74dbd31425ce00471a88ebcb6c7","cb779764ac9900e9d7ef0786117c31b6ce5bc573","e5ca770fbdaaecb492e80c0cd1b627bfbb6865f9","785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363","b3b1e10e86c11034faf22605958249109eec0532","0b3781f30e8a5abe2e354c4391dc5b025efcbc98","7065ece1a778fa3daa404f6d2db452e6a1cd5fbb","da96d10cac7538e686cec09b30a319588965be64","2ec7663df5f1bbf30434cf387e36f71bd1109241","68534b4bf8056e8577b57866c7f140ffee71b4f5","0065b39c8a5f591b32d566acb06037cd2b16fe66","91eb7f203242eb32c25a3e67ac13c87f1be0f0fd","08abcfc2802be6cac781f6f1971ad66fb83528fa","43e8d0ffd79932a29fd4dadecc4b29598dba6833","ab18869cf9e4de55259c80d9d9e7551e11c4ccaa","780d0dcd4d89cfd0985566d9f557cd6c364ed35f","0a366138cbd993fd40d0d6793efa9347c8e322f4","b8cb4de72d96dcf5009000fec62a3ff283d137ce","3266e3851abdf1c3967207406014542eb911cf87","3b95c9930e79dccf5e31266f1b3e627da54afbf7","0d699d7fdd325824e6459a3be22dd898e0021d75","999066aae78ae66c906432497f89823790a55c72","ff8c3dd8905dddd3b6e63d5ae77a29a78f6627d5","533a8e6aa8112380a5964bb8c0dc97802de540cc","f5ea2e3b9aa3137cd31f16edd2795a97b0e8143c","d50e3efcc5657020eb928d4dc5f9597948926301","62c163981d8cbaefe58d4491d653687f2ac157fa","9be6193b539feaf2ef3000d6ee7abdcd57b6f468","1ddc8966e09260f59e97b92f502a257b5abec0b7","430b3f71e4f8555554bd72e0316594a29dfea6b1","cb1aeb8de0b59b4d56c2fa413c03af784edaaa76","c083314ef7b770099c984bd6e2da7eddf737597b","87c9f512ad0adb5f364f126a58f70a70f91ce7fd","f06e8f1d344d756459d93fcfacbbd9d9140ba443","ae168294e6013ebf2af13cc6c4a825096f827a6c","dac57b44e2f30753f7034920295c086b5919bb86","cebdb3f935ebdeb5a9e521248fe19698a64f09a1","2bc3aff4e340ebf732aab26fd4290e81b3ccf6bf","35937ae64e02ed77ada79d97eb460ac02d3d3d1a","f9d6cb2d705573d818c7debbc34564a59b6ad94c","c918a272de7e52edae7a22b9ba4c6579884acaa2","9d9aeef8f6566e49f1f7b1ed0733d80eec40e329","61574a4654d14b60cfce3ab9fb03b8c86894eac2","28c1b3d8d11e28ac9a4b7b952c86053bac6a00f0","95da27d0ca857bf549031c97ea6ce38e17c0df5b","c076be93c3f49d21b6ca814904f58a3a8633f4d1"],"title":"Empirical Bayes Gibbs sampling.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/2.4.485"}
