These subpopulations could be defined by a risk factor or biomarker measured at baseline. We focus on situations where the overall population is partitioned into two, predefined subpopulations. When the true average treatment effect for the overall population is positive, it logically follows that it must be positive for at least one subpopulation. Our goal is to construct multiple testing procedures that maximize power for simultaneously rejecting the overall population null hypothesis and at least one subpopulation null hypothesis. We show that uniformly most powerful tests exist for this problem, in the case where outcomes are normally distributed. We construct new multiple testing procedures that, to the best of our knowledge, are the first to have this property. These procedures have the advantage of not requiring any sacrifice for detecting a treatment effect in the overall population, compared to the uniformly most powerful test of the overall population null hypothesis.","inCitations":["dbd65703bccce3f90c6eeabd59dc9bab0f89f809"],"title":"Uniformly Most Powerful Tests for Simultaneously Detecting a Treatment Effect in the Overall Population and at Least One Subpopulation.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2014.07.001"}

After initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy, these two variables display time-dependent dynamic changes with particular patterns well described by mathematical functions. In this article, we present a unifying statistical model for simultaneously characterizing specific quantitative trait loci in hosts that govern two different dynamic processes of HIV-1 loads and CD4+ T cell counts. The proposed model integrates clinically meaningful mathematical equations into a general framework for functional mapping of dynamic traits based on single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped from candidate genes or the entire human genome. An EM-simplex hybrid algorithm was derived to estimate the frequencies of QTL alleles and marker-QTL linkage disequilibria with the EM closed form as well as dynamic genetic effects of QTL specified by curve parameters and the parameters modeling the covariance structure. The new model allows for the formulation of various hypothesis tests to explore how a QTL pleiotropically affects HIV-1 and CD4+ dynamics and what is the relative contribution of pleiotropic effects and close association to the correlations between these two processes. The usefulness of the proposed model is demonstrated by the statistical analysis of real data containing longitudinal HIV-1 and CD4+ dynamics, and its statistical properties are examined through simulation studies. Finally, the extensions of the model and their clinical implications are discussed.","inCitations":["216a1e5ad6d737e859fa5a2564d69189e527453d","8ae27d7567872d90b3555347677ae100c0be8931","b84ea9424a7383eaa36ed93aaecb58a72eb8a692"],"title":"Joint Functional Mapping of Quantitative Trait Loci for HIV-1 and CD4+ Dynamics","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1136"}

Count measurements can only take nonnegative integer values; this and correlation between repeated measurements from an individual make the design and analysis of repeated-count data special. Sample size/power calculation is an important part of clinical trial design to ensure adequate power for detecting significant effect, and it is often based on the procedure for analysis. This paper describes an approach for calculating sample size/power for population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic experiments involving repeated-count measurements modeled as a Poisson process based on mixed-effects modeling technique. The noncentral version of the Wald chi(2) test is used for testing parameter/treatment significance. The approach was applied to two examples and the results were compared to results obtained from simulations in NONMEM. The first example involves calculating the power of a design to detect parameter significance between two groups: placebo and treatment group. The second example involves characterization of the dose-efficacy relationship of oxybutynin using a mixed-effects modeling approach. Weekly urge urinary incontinence episodes (a discrete count variable) is the primary efficacy variable and is modeled as a Poisson variable. A prospective study based on two different formulations of oxybutynin was designed using published population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. The results of simulation studies showed good agreement between the proposed method and NONMEM simulations.","inCitations":["cd8110f9e8874017a489e0bdeb0ea8a4d1cc289b","72f081ccdd43dbaed3900b016267c2b983b1e354","57279cce499687a7102cd54ab2d1de93be49bb7f","b969ce8edb9a75b5d92353fc24be9da230f03af2","4d5bdc4f14f2f1d90870ef86cfd52a2d9c340f4a","c085dde0efecb27da30821c7e221483c3042be9c","c6e80f38972da025888805a70772eb8f85a05edf","1860e5ef1d25f683c9120171aec25653031fb7e2","620e810d04cb5c52264706d49eac4b5106bbb46b","5631fa37d3e83cacf197dc94de3aee92aa3ef6d9","cd5a3de7518f306a2e98cb9c6752d599a9a75bfc"],"title":"Sample size/power calculations for population pharmacodynamic experiments involving repeated-count measurements.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003619205"}

One of these tasks, known as bump hunting, is to locate domains of a multidimensional input space where the target function assumes local maxima without pre-specifying their total number. A number of related methods already exist, yet are challenged in the context of high dimensional data. We introduce a novel supervised and multivariate bump hunting strategy for exploring modes or classes of a target function of many continuous variables. This addresses the issues of correlation, interpretability, and high-dimensionality (p â‰« n case), while making minimal assumptions. The method is based upon a divide and conquer strategy, combining a tree-based method, a dimension reduction technique, and the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM). Important to this task, we show how to estimate the PRIM meta-parameters. Using accuracy evaluation procedures such as cross-validation and ROC analysis, we show empirically how the method outperforms a naive PRIM as well as competitive non-parametric supervised and unsupervised methods in the problem of class discovery. The method has practical application especially in the case of noisy high-throughput data. It is applied to a class discovery problem in a colon cancer micro-array dataset aimed at identifying tumor subtypes in the metastatic stage.

The method combines a Bayes classifier and semi-parametric mixed effects model with robust tuning parameter to make the method robust to outlying curves, and to improve the accuracy of the risk or uncertainty estimates, which is crucial in medical diagnostic applications. The approach applies to functional data with varying ranges and irregular sampling without making parametric assumptions on the within-curve covariance. Simulation studies evaluate the proposed method and competitors in terms of sensitivity to heavy tailed functional distributions and outlying curves. Classification performance is evaluated by both error rate and logloss, the latter of which imposes heavier penalties on highly confident errors than on less confident errors. Runtime experiments on the R implementation indicate that the proposed method scales well computationally.

The proportion of cases followed, PCF(p), is the proportion of individuals who will develop disease who are included in the proportion p of individuals in the population at highest risk. The proportion needed to follow-up, PNF(q), is the proportion of the general population at highest risk that one needs to follow in order that a proportion q of those destined to become cases will be followed (Pfeiffer, R.M. and Gail, M.H., 2011. Two criteria for evaluating risk prediction models. Biometrics 67, 1057-1065). Here, we extend these criteria in two ways. First, we introduce two new criteria by integrating PCF and PNF over a range of values of q or p to obtain iPCF, the integrated PCF, and iPNF, the integrated PNF. A key assumption in the previous work was that the risk model is well calibrated. This assumption also underlies novel estimates of iPCF and iPNF based on observed risks in a population alone. The second extension is to propose and study estimates of PCF, PNF, iPCF, and iPNF that are consistent even if the risk models are not well calibrated. These new estimates are obtained from case-control data when the outcome prevalence in the population is known, and from cohort data, with baseline covariates and observed health outcomes. We study the efficiency of the various estimates and propose and compare tests for comparing two risk models, both of which were evaluated in the same validation data.","inCitations":["826193f91beb61d10706647bc669e3d927876a79","b9d2d47249aa19fb64d266a0dfe3962831459075","13e7af3660770987e15ed921185e5001791e4618","3844dcfaa1f114c5cdead4485012c8e4b2f058af","d546701bf24d99b36d4af077573837ed984f487d"],"title":"Extensions of criteria for evaluating risk prediction models for public health applications.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs037"}

In 2004 James Robins proposed g-estimation using structural nested mean models for making inference about the optimal dynamic regime in a multi-interval trial. The method provides clear advantages over traditional parametric approaches. Robins' g-estimation method always yields consistent estimators, but these can be asymptotically biased under a given structural nested mean model for certain longitudinal distributions of the treatments and covariates, termed exceptional laws. In fact, under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, every distribution constitutes an exceptional law under structural nested mean models which allow for interaction of current treatment with past treatments or covariates. This paper provides an explanation of exceptional laws and describes a new approach to g-estimation which we call Zeroing Instead of Plugging In (ZIPI). ZIPI provides nearly identical estimators to recursive g-estimators at non-exceptional laws while providing substantial reduction in the bias at an exceptional law when decision rule parameters are not shared across intervals.","inCitations":["dff24b4b3c88178607eac910fd21526d80423dad","97248bd521c8aa85b3fba43730461437794cd9e3","80fe27ec493550dcda8764c628212abcde400145","82bfd3aa19fe3ce5a4f14103fb3f0ecb15d198d9","23f7e78fa75d7634179c698b53e07a4ee12d1ccd","77d075644bc0dfd12ddff1b666460df8903a2973","520270f3e42f484669e8d0a386dd014f29242d67","0e739d92688a413b0eeb693817543372bd4acc7e","8ae9b324c9243c09104b5b98f8f5f9ae6da9723f","f942609d91e6ab62fb7034d34624b9380113bbaa","16e015ef8ae174a24ccce2fea9fcd63809dd1673","f921075fed8d1deb9e9a97dae13f2eab9f368af3","02a68da7fc6f21ecd011b006bb74a3427cb42b19","77ccc742456a14bc70208f84aa3bae35fb67950e","59e7551f5b6ffde5cc9f8f2e29bd3c6fae1f4155","f9e18780774478fcfe398c8a07cc8c1296b72c06","ba7c853734edb1e9548a05ffa71c15c235037798","35ed15b154d76c950e3a52d1bcb7e8b8bd2d1577","9c953423ca1bd7cf198afa0d78bad9092912c607","620af58eaa251370cc07b6c954716da22e84a12e","baabca857fa30b2080ff9099deba8e4050b480fa","c1795c040c2d96e7e4654a21611492f442c42b86","21eeb49b30a3a31ac764e31a3edcca2806c496fe","6c359f5b04d348a4237a57ca5fa25d63cd0dcd44","d78aba5c3593aa740983e5d09a88a373b7400f93","847092dc01d5b5f65b596cd880e906dbeb60134c","574e8ceee80a6907f1918c7e647325f74f5530e3","eacc1ac1ab35d650e50973e34b447c652ca4c408"],"title":"Estimating Optimal Dynamic Regimes: Correcting Bias under the Null: [Optimal dynamic regimes: bias correction].","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9469.2009.00661.x"}

Recently, various authors have proposed joint modeling approaches for longitudinal and time-to-event data for a single longitudinal variable. These joint modeling approaches become intractable with even a few longitudinal variables. In this paper we propose a regression calibration approach for jointly modeling multiple longitudinal measurements and discrete time-to-event data. Ideally, a two-stage modeling approach could be applied in which the multiple longitudinal measurements are modeled in the first stage and the longitudinal model is related to the time-to-event data in the second stage. Biased parameter estimation due to informative dropout makes this direct two-stage modeling approach problematic. We propose a regression calibration approach which appropriately accounts for informative dropout. We approximate the conditional distribution of the multiple longitudinal measurements given the event time by modeling all pairwise combinations of the longitudinal measurements using a bivariate linear mixed model which conditions on the event time. Complete data are then simulated based on estimates from these pairwise conditional models, and regression calibration is used to estimate the relationship between longitudinal data and time-to-event data using the complete data. We show that this approach performs well in estimating the relationship between multivariate longitudinal measurements and the time-to-event data and in estimating the parameters of the multiple longitudinal process subject to informative dropout. We illustrate this methodology with simulations and with an analysis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) data.","inCitations":["91f4ff38b609079a4084773c299a8aceadc869a9","fa46c148eb480fa7f790e3850728caa7fca80e52","7ecbfc42e3a8a0cca23915940cd8de14eb40b039","eb23cf85e45e1d3dd6e0c8a7fb6d161e5dcf17c5","8a1cc99e48df21e53e4fd91a96f07c890aa064b5","bb6f1d4f0a6271e1b720a5dda542b04b24b61382","f55e0d5f56f9c50e3f1e3f5a577a8a4e8477c89a","49f615b062c94cd30668b20332fa5cc7bf4a31c8","4fbe5e95693df02edfded4fbecbfe7ee06610366","3f9f04d2bf6697e53a24112681e47538d55f8bbc","894d47968641fbb721f81998e3625b8f535c4216","1e11570c9256a1443dcec69e937fd75e63ca172d","c83d6a446c78b1ad3af28d7548437370d899286b"],"title":"An Approach for Jointly Modeling Multivariate Longitudinal Measurements and Discrete Time-to-event Data.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS339"}

Based on the foundational principles of the EMEA guideline, biosimilars are expected to be similar, not identical, to the innovator biologics they seek to copy. In this article, we develop a consistency approach for assessment of similarity between a biosimilar product and the innovator biologic. A method for sample size determination for conducting a clinical trial to assess the biosimilar product is also proposed.

Unlike linear models, the non-linearity of link functions used for binary data force a distinction between marginal and conditional interpretations. This distinction is blurred in probit models with a normally distributed random intercept because the resulting model implies a probit marginal link as well. That is, this model is closed in the sense that the distribution associated with the marginal and conditional link functions and the random effect distribution are all of the same family. It is shown that the closure property is also attained when the distributions associated with the conditional and marginal link functions and the random effect distribution are mixtures of normals. The resulting flexible family of models is demonstrated to be related to several others present in the literature and can be used to synthesize several seemingly disparate modeling approaches. In addition, this family of models offers considerable computational benefits. A diverse series of examples is explored that illustrates the wide applicability of this approach.","inCitations":["ec771790c54c780e71b86c19e8e71ec3f838d95f","8583a285e6c9ae0a9676a4270b59c4410ac5fda6","c1b808cd2c63ba9dc682827cf8d99e9ac9da4dac","f3d6c507f31889c87d8b41a43898d4c0f1206fe6","1fe61aa8c7c7dbf14a19807677609325f1520156","f1d6936742c476379054b955c6d8c76f1a08e120","65328abdb876ae7c8aecf953963a2127f81e8dfa","9d3a15eefcd559f86a01b7a14c428adbdcfb6aba","9b18ae37be26f4a967e52d028ea12087c5505a69","ed191facec0f7285b712418d63009b113e898a64","7d985f36551b17315aeea02163adc2dabf352a83","68d6a45db3a9ae835826ebc80b2ef647d8f4554e","10992b7a38b4104fdec3fb68b24f1c79efdce486","cd584483a180e50b01bf67dafc882d39d9d42cdc","ccbe3919abc3ac67adb62f025a8ef822c9f82e2b","cec775be96a4cedc1982a58ff1b3b07cf33aa214","9d99a2f808a99fba2f1092fa3fa2ef4f85eec0cc","be925c6b38bdd22cd163e8d7b1d52d8cc7ac683b","2402c125572e6da3e3501e88c1f3dca7a32c9252","11395d27d18326c9fd40f15c4c71f97b094e036b","6e8a8bbe1bbd1d17b2d8e11d1a944feceb41c0a1","f8208aac67bdeed13398233042c3710cc4050dcf","2eaab934d64d3e01b5375c4b92447621e8e58226"],"title":"Flexible random intercept models for binary outcomes using mixtures of normals","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2006.09.031"}

In situations where quantile slope coefficients share some common features, estimation efficiency and model interpretability can be improved by utilizing such commonality across quantiles. Furthermore, elimination of irrelevant predictors will also aid in estimation and interpretation. These motivations lead to the development of two penalization methods, which can identify the interquantile commonality and nonzero quantile coefficients simultaneously. The developed methods are based on a fused penalty that encourages sparsity of both quantile coefficients and interquantile slope differences. The oracle properties of the proposed penalization methods are established. Through numerical investigations, it is demonstrated that the proposed methods lead to simpler model structure and higher estimation efficiency than the traditional quantile regression estimation.","inCitations":["99a2a6c6353a217eb986523fed8933077b7e7e1e","29ca74c4149f84661bbba2d4282021bceae31379","75a25ab6bc4bbdd81e5e83e67132f5c315700e0d","ebb117577b8b2ce12229e346382fa5e17c617d40","51ecf586567338171f60c48b532242a62124858c","04707bf91eee11771e81573672e075d9acf04e96","6b6702c1cd050f8bfbac833726dc740119c47c69","852e77e3e0806b03a23a7f2b198b406435caec94","71d7233f4e490dcd1e221cf0d4b7584a6806b6b2","cb3428259f7ca8441a01f9444b33c7bb9a04352a","efb7ddf3ac55c51769a43614cd1c9ee4c82955ca","dff6f6955f8233fdde892127f8bec4779be5cf95"],"title":"Interquantile shrinkage and variable selection in quantile regression","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2013.08.006"}

Simulations and real data examples demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, PRtest's careful handling of the nonnull density can give a much better fit in the tails of the mixture distribution which, in turn, can lead to more realistic conclusions.","inCitations":["67fd9043b2625a01d7b3e954734f0b3ca6546365","c42c04bc285a65a8583d7491abbb0817b34bcf18","e4c5c6b9160c9f869845305845a10a2d3e0fb9fa","bab7d45203db902b0299a3e819d7107cb12a2a6e","b9155921ee305a6ce0fc8294487218170c929ec4","18efdd97521a315d4916549901a27ab90a766417","2273f46c2aee0e51b20c7de2132e4dd511adf328","7de19f9df35371e467b0f6c1bf7d054799864561","d82befab3a185b4934cf85247e1985917419a591","e0a6e9054f97a6ab8592052460b4b84297233e99","24dae9aea990b596b0f13b99dd7f4f8cd5b4ef44","3e52b68b6d34bc5d28144ad3ea8de5acfd5660b3","19b0c1c501abcf09e396602da00217964b407afc","6c416103fca46c051ac0b93dad6181acf1309e1d","bc0003eff7c1b6ccfd95d33758fc174b290122eb","1a5633f2b789478375750eef672cf1769353d410","baeea2d48a3ff9bd0702def492fe934ef6e4ab86","7c97461fc59e59892ed0aa4b5614cfe938bf6156","177f2ac22a44e3474b0649a29d3d2a2e841f7105","3dda24e8ac0324e1b50be35b3c28b42766819fb0","26065684fccf25a8b179dfd0e17da80a62660023"],"title":"A nonparametric empirical Bayes framework for large-scale multiple testing.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr039"}

The terms specify network statistics that are sufficient to represent the probability distribution over the space of networks of that size. Many classes of statistics can be used. In this article we describe the classes of statistics that are currently available in the ergm package. We also describe means for controlling the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that the package uses for estimation. These controls a ect either the proposal distribution on the sample space used by the underlying Metropolis-Hastings algorithm or the constraints on the sample space itself.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2010,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Biological products or medicines are therapeutic agents that are produced using a living system or organism. Access to these life-saving biological products is limited because of their expensive costs. Patents on the early biological products will soon expire in the next few years. This allows other biopharmaceutical/biotech companies to manufacture the generic versions of the biological products, which are referred to as follow-on biological products by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or as biosimilar medicinal products by the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) of the European Union (EU). Competition of cost-effective follow-on biological products with equivalent efficacy and safety can cut down the costs and hence increase patients' access to the much-needed biological pharmaceuticals. Unlike for the conventional pharmaceuticals of small molecules, the complexity and heterogeneity of the molecular structure, complicated manufacturing process, different analytical methods, and possibility of severe immunogenicity reactions make evaluation of equivalence (similarity) between the biosimilar products and their corresponding innovator product a great challenge for both the scientific community and regulatory agencies. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current regulatory requirements for approval of biosimilar products. A review of current criteria for evaluation of bioequivalence for the traditional chemical generic products is provided. A detailed description of the differences between the biosimilar and chemical generic products is given with respect to size and structure, immunogenicity, product quality attributed, and manufacturing processes. In addition, statistical considerations including design criteria, fundamental biosimilar assumptions, and statistical methods are proposed. The possibility of using genomic data in evaluation of biosimilar products is also explored.","inCitations":["4b3ce815af84a6d1866213190167bba85d7ceba7","5d3ef4bec0940b5bd960981758e860cc5d2d1571","0f18a93d68ce1ce67fe50f0c7d628a7c60b6dfe9","4f71472d7eb02af4133f7a1ddd7aa3b838f121dc","accaf379dba883356243a3a0596b0ffa97a702ab","8828b9cda643adc129c399fd96485d96e8bde38b","ca492dd883c9afb6abd401fbb6523c28b8c2852c","70ac9d005449cd82cc75c4631d6e7f4efdfa8bd8","954bec6a6ba88597dac2746f0dcfa7e3eb525651","8396ee74f1b063e3a6b12016128536e9dfc1bfee","a411ff746d65512eb72b95c7d8f55a8156c05403","9eb85fec71c1e053d1e87df2cc97612c584ab314","572bdc1f8754278a9dd16cbe559054d106392f70","e1fff1e6cfbe2d6c962d31bed903ada059542e93","ce3bb9911e347479c69922529124668cdb2a164d","c5fc43e388eefafcad61c9393ed5ba3b46cc6d18","f5e68d8666e9dd758bdebbedd548403e8eb2b245","e39d7769f3fe4dadc4cdc53023d696ded96dd0a8","72a0da7b962a9968c127665a192b3c75e370ce2d","6745cf652218043d711c695dedb2c487e2a68054","d8ed888e02ac0959cfa83e6c40816c93a0f20989","74c9bf0d33555eaf7f98c0e971d72fbe43148735"],"title":"Statistical assessment of biosimilar products.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903280266"}

In many trials, auxiliary covariate information may also be available, and it is of interest to exploit these auxiliary data to improve the efficiency of inferences. In this paper, we propose a 2-stage design with continuous outcome where the second-stage data is sampled with an \"outcome-auxiliary-dependent sampling\" (OADS) scheme. We propose an estimator which is the maximizer for an estimated likelihood function. We show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The simulation study indicates that greater study efficiency gains can be achieved under the proposed 2-stage OADS design by utilizing the auxiliary covariate information when compared with other alternative sampling schemes. We illustrate the proposed method by analyzing a data set from an environmental epidemiologic study.","inCitations":["3a59bb107fc705f1d06f7299fb1f6cb2fd67e486","a178527a8c8cddf998773ea610d1b7672e4fa164","52db4645a29f6852804e70e5f32a5a0d206a55b1","b17a5d38a542668bfafc644179163a0955f7cfd0","2a6f449a1a16e46098b066cf171b5e408e30436a"],"title":"Semiparametric inference for a 2-stage outcome-auxiliary-dependent sampling design with continuous outcome.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq080"}

Earlier proposed consistency index to assess the consistency of quality of raw materials and/or final product processed or manufactured from different locations or sites has only focused on a single (i.e., the most active) component assuming that the most active component can be quantitatively identified among multiple active components. In this paper, we extend such results to the case of two correlative components. Sampling plans (sample sizes) are obtained for various combinations of study parameters. An example concerning a TCM for treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis is presented to illustrate the use of the proposed method. Some concluding remarks are also provided.","inCitations":["b982ae7e061271e88fe7ab915d29b84380fb3066","b3009f9a53a842e304b530480b2e8cca73c5cd5d","a9087b4cf4a7fb32e0c1c0d041248954f104ccb2","517a13694b867774ec339f90abd963b20fb951c8","05f0f4f655aa01876750cd2ac7d5b0b8a1c705b3"],"title":"Assessing the consistency of traditional Chinese medicine with multiple correlative active components.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701513934"}

Hence the sample size calculation at the planning stage of a clinical trial may also be questionable. Adjustment of the sample size during the mid-course of a clinical trial has become a popular strategy lately. In this paper we propose a procedure for calculating additional sample size needed based on conditional power, and adjusting the final-stage critical value to protect the overall type-I error rate. Compared to other previous procedures, the proposed procedure uses the definition of the conditional type-I error directly without appealing to an extra special function for it. It has better flexibility in setting up interim decision rules and the final-stage test is a likelihood ratio test.","inCitations":["66866bc938c28352983b8815a56dad2030cd844e","d625b396a70a7b374a9f9dca0fc2e176e524180e","c3a042c18f827166ba2dc8afa816abc0a3fdd8d2","ea4ece11891a3bc700391505e94038ec3bd64109","bf3a2c20abdaef14dfe3f9e3fb20583ec1b665e9","738c82936ca822c06a5cb49fe469f9e481e8f582","02875958e89a1c2137ee1a81fe9b0f31ed50aafa","995e5275431d324ea1bd4c6769f891f0ccda592d","38e598295396b2c88790708af001447bebab1538","8342ead7a5da3fe540219c1e40bd83620e7aa6de","4ed966060f9338d95c563d209df123e26edc0108","3346a71826cc8e20220203be196d1b0bac358408","b85e149ab95bc873380b1493053fad62eccc2709","77c82f063b01461d5160f7ce0f423d903f7b5a84","f6bb1ad7120d3f427da95f31d771eb2036348f13","ab71df228c3adef2a6c70dc663893fa677677c35","e0d87f38974a0270e575e430b74ff5df371be46c","0a6202b345d49f5e5e77a820e8fec573a8390390","b93585b8f99257b1ef43ac1105d3eb3bac9f6915","7a12945acfd58105efb68c450c7f4bd734ba832a","3970ad3ccb5f9defcedf25d44669997f23bcab69","19b58bc13c1626b5c5dc376a2e16f4d4fead9ac9","7c6bf5bfa071e8a3f62ca32e75b0742dc22f3f67","a6e62b16707086a034f7512cf8cfb86ac684a0ab","93e0dd8f4ee095da4d5be6f0c6cbe9b982002fd8","caa35ab78423d4990126d6deea8d3673c9a5f10e","91d2b821cef88a54a60ca098fc2f326ce5a024d9","c7912d650b6fe98787ca6c52edc24d008f5b355a","51c240589f3ef162adab04295a5d64e48a51fc9a","c373adc952187b51d95e337e94d1b1e7533e7463","6588a55f0a1661804a9bfa1b900570f1329d0c2f","520f56d1c9260ce5b76dfda5259b593d9044c1e0","e97db076c4af6bd446d09bc991597dd1b32fe335","3004d1ff0258dfdc3caf72388732515767d5ffda","537004c297ad363e08fc0857e1bd810da7e2945a"],"title":"A sample size adjustment procedure for clinical trials based on conditional power.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.2.277"}
