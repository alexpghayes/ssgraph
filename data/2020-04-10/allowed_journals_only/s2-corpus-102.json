For nonparametric varying coefficients, we can borrow the idea of parametrically guided estimation to improve asymptotic bias. In this paper, we develop a guided estimation procedure for the nonparametric varying coefficient models. Asymptotic properties are established for the guided estimators and a method of bandwidth selection via bias-variance tradeoff is proposed. We compare the performance of the guided estimator with that of the unguided estimator via both simulation and real data examples.","inCitations":["7d4d391b22933f993136f2151a4dbaadf878e18a","ccf72633f8a37bbf6c4fbe187bdd0a442d367ec7"],"title":"Parametrically guided estimation in nonparametric varying coefficient models with quasi-likelihood.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2015.1026903"}

Such data occur if a recurrent event study involves several related types of recurrent events and the observation scheme or process may be subject-specific. For the problem, a class of semiparametric transformation models is presented, which provides a great flexibility for modelling the effects of covariates on the recurrent event processes. For estimation of regression parameters, an estimating equation-based inference procedure is developed and the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimates are established. Also the proposed approach is evaluated by simulation studies and applied to the data arising from a skin cancer chemoprevention trial.","inCitations":["3f4d9c416b8ab6847df8998da160674a00a48595","918b56ae86f2a93726e87d0b0e83d8933b218b9e","706af2283706de847d79f051d28cf3df6315a7e4","65b15feaecf897e91b1b28263bfee36529fe413d","8c7b6a54328a27f08aca5675dd8b6139690d3dc8","69e8f41272ec9f8db192a5cb153f5f5d10d15c0b","2629ed4b2344ebb3f0c9ac947dae3f6fc719cde1"],"title":"Semiparametric transformation models for multivariate panel count data with dependent observation process.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.10118"}

Specifically, this vague term can refer to conventional tests of significance, one of three univariate solutions with adjusted degrees of freedom, two different types of multivariate statistic, or approaches that combine univariate and multivariate tests. Accordingly, it is argued that, by only reporting probability values and referring to statistical analyses as repeated measures ANOVA, authors convey neither the type of analysis that was used nor the validity of the reported probability value, since each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses. The various approaches are presented with a discussion of their strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations are made regarding the 'best' choice of analysis. Additional topics discussed include analyses for missing data and tests of linear contrasts.","inCitations":["9c831b34afef6c4449bcd7613a8c3cd75c1d9ecb","74cd66f4b8240a6695224bb9d54e3df418cb9183","1ab64d548d8dfb6f39ddb165551e066aefad52e1","bb5ebd6fe485f1969be225e9934cd6eb738c11ca","90949c33d3efea031d64ab77a9bc0c0610c654cb","87a28f1ce59ee32d46f30e4f7b4d3f78849c4b0a","28f80b408f2f5c26a22b242e3760b6fe35ea0668","0abb17de8cb4112dfaf61606f81edcbae5810556","1713f3243525f8fe36bb9e2de97ba1b098849151","d2fecdbedb6b4e60db1e29c647ae77a712f8ba94","2b02b65ea42c95f8a0cfec5afddbf57813bbb762","99e9641edcac1d0f2c0a34bc680bc373591aab02","523ed33a78e071255bbb49c47a5af79216585f01","092f22c00913fafa5f313edd9d83a854c272c861","681475b24bba4c15dc3883d352312610132b7986","3ed4744305b545a29fa03ab9983a0c05b69afa63","3e6a0829b6491bc5b8b87da8667e12e30e38744f","119d1b8e22a24a3916ad911fc9481b294c8ca081","4ef9cf2650a55c206e813b32c28ecf5d269b9f3c","45843c0795faef2374480b8c6d2ca0e2fd52e9f9","c68da6750273724e46591a05a8b7bd880d455d17","fce9eca8e684a28711fb94e97f5b39332cb5784d","0bff0e979740ad280f68f1c63c4be28f90acdcf6","7b802f952383663d9871a3bcd3ef917e93aab7d2","0256175602b7d87d52bfc5dcd5e0a10d62b8a17d","d8ad5559cf5ebcc765c4673a3a3b3395196d4b92","c7aa51178cef88e0a1cf378f166881ce255e218c","70f65725db2f58bfd411df6e1c0bd9a2f0e8e9b1","defdd4e873a47e7d5157abc2cbecc4aa3c2cd0e0","e291a7aba8ba8d9da4f68edcbe72e6fbc4dd6b7f","0f5b7d37b969675170d385e711c95984b9e6da08","848a1b75accaee9c288a64b98555a8c0d63efe60","9bc3522c59a5bb82951f476f59b6f03b1eb9f8eb","4deb319acbbb3cd406f695b92a00bc566615a396","806e6f36fcd3357ebd6f4e3f0643cae0eb056cea","25f9d97713d89aef86b3ba211fb1de19bc78a9a4","b7b14d18e4f85bcec7b44be26c00848e61404497","6356c02ec7e15a8eea78b71c17554f8e5a377822","434543384fdd88e3d954ecf5bc8de238a1aa1c93","ec4b606ff7ffac72ed0db4bacbd6492c98a75b2c","722ed5192af45c082427508737a2eeb74b208968","06570a3552961000cb8937b0671dca5501c0fb04","7b188ffcfde0ae1bafe4d2a6b81dc08e951abce3","0f2ce7301898052dba94e68281285d321d0757b2","5c02bb854bc5e4982bc68cd848f0bf544fb5cfae","cb8b1a0782814ec704842687961648e98c1aa0c0","215eb7fbf962d70cce5ec7a329d213412cce5f08","0ac6111086464329161b5f7fde08270fa1357e9d","c3bcc4737c6f16f6bdfbf3032ccdd62bcd5364c5","022307c073bfaf82c40f3d247a4eacf481ec3d09","66d64209c0a987739438a03dde1deaa41233c87d","02b55859b26061b3b68cc3668181753724437c08","174d9f594d066e4b92ca1c67129091ed54d4add3","6dadb21cfbddc786efbce943634ca03bd88adc46","baeb304d16db5e512164739dc7b3487afd4c3355","deaf6230da40c3f7d49d16d359857dbd69576e5d","dbdaa3b3e48c052254e345df41864ad562a2d568","a527659875370c2c862490f32edbc35ec50faf52","c7544bfd69f634b9e1e2c83b3194e4c6535b4f57","bdd2817d98e97a10bf30e901aca5b9d3cec86a10","996d2d4879267774c6aadfe3a9d26ee952ed51ab","183711064004a0483479d206103f44756f553b06","efcd431908eb3224b558ad3a0a19efb0b07f9e0b","e8083fa8865ac9701f0efa17f4216c6f93ff4211","7b21b3942cc5243ebbe7780a6648238550e7f70a","2f8eb4e8147e7cff753c3540aa94ac5adc06d0f8","dcde85e54a512d546236f9e3c740a22a13cb377e","826432538c17ad17ab79725820ac7e0643a3de30","7a64c6f66d741fb89007a7ca2a9f615e2eafa5e2","5749bb387fb23e65558f9a10bfe2dc462f982120","c846ea7200cc44f82dc3c5417c8fc91556947e72","9b79fe18cc6cbfe60c5bc411308febaee468fc1a","48e8529d0ee4cb6be241bb7a271619acb4abb860","6f271b80cf61164178f3e7e5d3bd733757d870d1","4a19222276cbfa30a65cf8651c5958f6d2dbbc2c","20a5ad3cab1c264c2d1fc3345b8381fd2da98a9f","fa8dca5bc0b6866fd51204b8ca5cf1ad8161f60e","5bc7131a888e59c127f8b4bf8c082235e00de41d","82cfa5caee3cd9511961559df609f2f7acfc5b59","785bf33107765efd146706b992e055d37c4a6c0c","55c0b934b995b5954fc592a854cd58240e337ed5","2d61b19ebf4ae3bb7185303e09fd5402799a2c9d","3e64c5534d41daf35bd584337694ed88b74f696f","173fe4e0050d6bac4a850ebae703283d6e6c8620","51bf6d3d18b285240c4802e0d7fa25f19a3135aa","c87a5b80e4035188f7f400d30fd7aca3f769df49","37ad951fbc82a7932f00c0c29d961cef29e8a667","da2b3ec1d041403b05f05c6291070876df2c8ba3","4ce729fede0db3a4d835262a1840bc40f76f214e","db1298f3e32f2453f4002e1d36cb4249b125180e","3c1f509a3fc3fa4171583207d3d1b398bc35a465","624a399086c8f73bfb0aedea3c19936fad6e4904","7a0f9276de25e99547cf2c82800e09714baf681c","b42e43534430b7e66fc7b4fe9e1bcf47b45f84bd","80448450b1144878c9b191ccf099878ec01288bd","dce6b343b1f786fee1865ea4ce0d9fb769b5d9c9","05a00d23234a94fea724f1d668431a6034a073dc","f54bda0163698a190a5de9ef469c5019e9b14719","312569ad1474621c750b5bb6c8ab2721cd3729cc","a6ae5ea1b72a61b9d6a3143917deef50f67854c6","15cf03113f9a1f72486dd6a53e0c9c681c998a26","cad4c35afdc14bd04fc395be8e168c5e9a0039d7","f3b9e72a1c92449b384acfac994304004f049db1","a53bafa46e7c727746233387b52397dc4233c6e0","928ad0aa0a7456dd0d46dcca4e418c131a2fa148","aa82362983e3ac53039da0fc78e4d0148760811f","dc29757b2411bc116b16b7fe353b3c789e808be7","6b8e0ac82e057b0b4e25543ae7d46d7e022ee9ac","e4f2c92b5705c9fdb4098e7eded9bc1e6a9c43c8","f3f0e5f01b9762b27c8ae80213e2b9d3758b264e","ac716a799f33671f9b39911dd2ae5c64861571eb","d3349526c655aa8e8b11dc953882f5130f546ecc","b8ce5e3106693bf045a58d33e368cd672df563b9","1de3127689c96d2a62f4fc2c0f9c350de3f06148","c5b276647c641e76afac3be55dc8a2451fcd0ead","cbbea95a1ead9dddc01332069d6

Accelerometers can record quasi-continuous activity information for many days and for hundreds of individuals. For example, in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging physical activity was recorded every minute for [Formula: see text] adults for an average of [Formula: see text] days per adult. An important scientific problem is to separate and quantify the systematic and random circadian patterns of physical activity as functions of time of day, age, and gender. To capture the systematic circadian pattern, we introduce a practical bivariate smoother and two crucial innovations: (i) estimating the smoothing parameter using leave-one-subject-out cross validation to account for within-subject correlation and (ii) introducing fast computational techniques that overcome problems both with the size of the data and with the cross-validation approach to smoothing. The age-dependent random patterns are analyzed by a new functional principal component analysis that incorporates both covariate dependence and multilevel structure. For the analysis, we propose a practical and very fast trivariate spline smoother to estimate covariate-dependent covariances and their spectra. Results reveal several interesting, previously unknown, circadian patterns associated with human aging and gender.","inCitations":["1085cb9588bb01c951dd0f213baefce9a7cca023","bcf131f7351014d5462adf2de4e5308dc8d7dd4c","c2cac711189b0f096f3a98160739bba0deae8008","1d8244237161c5003bfb59af3f7bae038e7c9f7b","b72aec04e47e54c3bce8c1eb121f3a47b401c0cb","76f098f8751d6f5e99f2a39065bfc81f6d4e5f84","f6608dab97872d19a12dc22b5d5aca56af73ad15","2ff2a5035839e1019fdcef6596fb56ef63e9f328","5be9428ad38a8e05929627b325ee210f9ad752cd","03eadbab9d117412ba27ba08be3a03ef6c8cda89","b270b991691a5e16495102110b748537f5ce7516","502ab4c942911788b10ea6d8565d1677a35379ea","4f96ba6e8ccb974adad452e28382766fd1ae05e7","87532e3a5dec7a612254cf8da6284dc8428d5e59","3fe24d6d95b680e14579de89db87619faa16a536","f2852bf162aab9e651aaa81f4efbb9f7b6bc3485","67e0f3e643cc25784d6eee6291e3c2167f9b19b3","52117627cd5495438ae3ee17c1591145fe68454c","d328b904f265b97c94714157a9ec7a31e37cb5dc","db7af1f1a8dd19a1d22d80b5663d56c986a8bda2","c99de8e8797078d97122552957d3346341d52bdc","37da0ec1e489b41cf24ce11030da8cd6ad874125","c47f44e91c8e99a5d0583a2c6d839e38294574fa","95bc1bdeff3a441adeb43d89f0278e0999bfa439","80f898a0c75e2c11e89ea5c500231d2a9de616bd","44281980fec1ae274c43c489e840f2cc94696b3c"],"title":"Quantifying the lifetime circadian rhythm of physical activity: a covariate-dependent functional approach.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu045"}

For a parallel design, a two-period crossover design, two three-period crossover designs, and a Latin square design with three periods, we compared variances of estimators based on a mixed analysis of variance model. The proposed three-period crossover designs turned out to be only slightly less efficient than the Latin square design, which is not capable of satisfying the necessary safety conditions. The analysis of data from the crossover design poses several problems, including nonconstant variances for all observations and the possibility of carryover effects. To resolve these issues, we generalized the Box-Cox transformations to the mixed model at hand and, using simulation, investigated the sensitivity of the analysis to the presence of (first-order) carryover effects. This showed that results from the model without carryover are reliable for only very small carryover effects.","inCitations":["aed65c23adde5b4bbfd3c27f1a3593f1ba4c2f46","b47136184b570c6c4023ac66b8dc06eaf67834fd","468e3f11eebb15f705e19f0fb46c92cb8d66baa6"],"title":"Design and analysis issues for crossover designs in phase I clinical studies.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101003"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is now part of standard of care for acute leukemia (AL). To reduce toxicity of the pre-transplant conditioning regimen, intravenous busulfan is usually used as a preparative regimen for AL patients undergoing allo-SCT. Systemic busulfan exposure, characterized by the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), is strongly associated with clinical outcome. An AUC that is too high is associated with severe toxicities, while an AUC that is too low carries increased risks of disease recurrence and failure to engraft. Consequently, an optimal AUC interval needs to be determined for therapeutic use. To address the possibility that busulfan pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics vary significantly with patient characteristics, we propose a tailored approach to determine optimal covariate-specific AUC intervals. To estimate these personalized AUC intervals, we apply a flexible Bayesian nonparametric regression model based on a dependent Dirichlet process and Gaussian process, DDP-GP. Our analyses of a dataset of 151 patients identified optimal therapeutic intervals for AUC that varied substantively with age and whether the patient was in complete remission or had active disease at transplant. Extensive simulations to evaluate the DDP-GP model in similar settings showed that its performance compares favorably to alternative methods. We provide an R package, DDPGPSurv, that implements the DDP-GP model for a broad range of survival regression analyses.","inCitations":["1001ca294f6a9124aa548b532bc3bc550964635a","d7f50acd322ff96867a2afadb9582d4dc1d15c09"],"title":"Bayesian non-parametric survival regression for optimizing precision dosing of intravenous busulfan in allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12331"}

For microarray and other high-dimensional data, the presence of many noise variables may mask underlying clustering structures. Hence removing noise variables via variable selection is necessary. For simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation, existing penalized likelihood approaches in model-based clustering analysis all assume a common diagonal covariance matrix across clusters, which however may not hold in practice. To analyze high-dimensional data, particularly those with relatively low sample sizes, this article introduces a novel approach that shrinks the variances together with means, in a more general situation with cluster-specific (diagonal) covariance matrices. Furthermore, selection of grouped variables via inclusion or exclusion of a group of variables altogether is permitted by a specific form of penalty, which facilitates incorporating subject-matter knowledge, such as gene functions in clustering microarray samples for disease subtype discovery. For implementation, EM algorithms are derived for parameter estimation, in which the M-steps clearly demonstrate the effects of shrinkage and thresholding. Numerical examples, including an application to acute leukemia subtype discovery with microarray gene expression data, are provided to demonstrate the utility and advantage of the proposed method.","inCitations":["ef9925875316ee87d0f7e36523902ff26f902cb0","779dc281c88c618d5654a55e82cef2558dba02e6","c17526f836a3b9cec7bf52edea629f59a60c27f6","adef1691b3c10eaa445507f4543e96a1ce5bcdab","ef7e16bd9ba8904be9f94ae86930e6244f88b928","d8a1d16bbe2874044e6d9927fb09963e93b8223b","95de1fa3f9c19ee800db44db901fb59b6695268f","4daa9074878d44f31dc8a5242f99127d344e96a1","e65e5f8be9b2061608a8aedf82b4364dd7919622","f2694338158ffdd74030c64402ca93170ce43518","66c0c02189457bb8f9174984d839a86f0af74b05","3766d6fe45328e3d94ea0b3823001a1e9d317214","3d123b2dbccb6027d4f54f7c671f40bcbf873d2e","a80eb63bea6766fc6443e60abb5c47119f732b10","be5526590e9a9cfd5f5eb51597b778663143eb5e","2ab7cc0eba2b0991805b6b8f86b555c8a60ec844","35b5709d2e3606018fe358c00392701561f8b24a","3784a51ec0d25794bc58cacf8cff0370a75edb28","e0584ebfcdd285cbd97cacab35afe46da3550d20","535904adf9677ce3fb693449f57d5b193dc94a58","3ba453570fcfe6979c9ab618a07e1c2c3ccb654d","bbd4065fbe4152e619f4e6722f312da39d71ff83","077c7654c3ed30842028437ad47ef143800562ba","e8441594175d359072b885b12436a3af629902ac","06d5b0ef194e9735e0a2a38e165b103ba2b22e7b","c56672fa544e9f0212a1e52fe81fbce549266601","0af3e4ee068e9decd125d4d0266d7fa1798c626c","27882c736ad05257bae1638c412104ac2fc39746","ddc467fc8f3fd1a7a4373f9c94d30d3a25d88647","ae6810657c7c4c0c65f5f3d0261a516f9d7bc4ee","11d49d8faeed7a6fb241c0c3270d7f9b37152692","0cd38100fcf6ae8877d9dd2e97b816e23fe4238d","49689e0865f9bd07eda875c5c70f8b4c590ce0ed","78882ee90e99fd0ded4795e5bdde77fe26ecb1ad","5e6d10b9df6c9555f5261b8b5367e84dadabbdab","b56b8fe0d89e8955b5568e8e4c77799e3d55857a","01457010ba4665172f2b93a377de62e07f9c7617","30cd29c2ead772dafd1cd3ea5c791973c4161d36","e781a1183b10a60e626963e1c4a645c9e5e03c7b","2eb3a86d797e8940bd79f6431a2e06197fbcde8c","282754ace601fe4113890c1235ab62c296a1077d","6222e7a494ca7cc9c005a5b7ebf1a6ed138fd807","86b939285a4827e875167c08727a6f497866fe8a","81eae0eae76f074b1d6e03b9db0ecddcc1eb766f"],"title":"Penalized model-based clustering with cluster-specific diagonal covariance matrices and grouped variables.","doi":"10.1214/08-EJS194"}

An item fit plot, comparing the observed and predicted proportion-correct scores of examinees with different raw scores, is suggested. This paper also suggests how to obtain posterior predictive p-values (which are natural Bayesian p-values) for the item fit statistics of Orlando and Thissen that summarize numerically the information in the above-mentioned item fit plots. A number of simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested item fit diagnostics.

Statistical methods for combining historical data with randomized data, while accounting for the incompatibility between the two, have been recently proposed and remain an active field of research. The current literature is lacking a rigorous comparison between methods but also guidelines about their use in practice. In this paper, we compare the existing methods based on a confirmatory phase III study design exercise done for a new antibacterial therapy with a binary endpoint and a single historical dataset. A procedure to assess the relative performance of the different methods for borrowing information from historical control data is proposed, and practical questions related to the selection and implementation of methods are discussed. Based on our examination, we found that the methods have a comparable performance, but we recommend the robust mixture prior for its ease of implementation.","inCitations":["b280c8565f758a9695bdc24c9948cd37281c7453","a898acc2de378fb47650c7793361c919f1765c6b","c9c48cfbda15232793e585fd7c9a84c13dac0904","6db5d0ced9fe413bfd6c75d0bfc5b869a30412f8","2e5d0547c61286075560d979985ecf50d3e7bce2"],"title":"Use of a historical control group in a noninferiority trial assessing a new antibacterial treatment: A case study and discussion of practical implementation aspects.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1843"}

Using standard methods from survival analysis such as the Cox model or Kaplan-Meier estimates would overcome this problem but limit the analysis to the first safety-related event of each subject. As an alternative, we discuss two models for recurrent events data-the Andersen-Gill and Prentice-Williams-Peterson model-regarding their applicability to safety data from randomized controlled trials. We argue that these models can be used to estimate two different quantities: a direct treatment effect on the risk of an event (Prentice-Williams-Peterson) and a total treatment effect as sum of the direct effect and the treatment's indirect effect via the event history (Anderson-Gill). Using simulated data, we illustrate the difference between these treatment effects and analyze the performance of both models in different scenarios. Because both models are limited to the analysis of cause-specific hazards if competing risks are present, we suggest to incorporate estimates of the mean frequency of events in the analysis to additionally allow the comparison of treatment effects on absolute event probabilities. We demonstrate the application of both models and the mean frequency function to safety endpoints with an illustrative analysis of data from a randomized phase-III study.

Endpoints in such trials are usually mortality or irreversible morbidity. For a given endpoint, the norm is to use a single test statistic and to use that same statistic for each analysis. This approach is risky because the test statistic has to be specified before the study is unblinded, and there is loss in power if the assumptions that ensure optimality for each analysis are not met. To minimize the risk of moderate to substantial loss in power due to a suboptimal choice of a statistic, a robust method was developed for nonsequential trials. The concept is analogous to diversification of financial investments to minimize risk. The method is based on combining P values from multiple test statistics for formal inference while controlling the type I error rate at its designated value.This article evaluates the performance of 2 P value combining methods for group sequential trials. The emphasis is on time to event trials although results from less complex trials are also included. The gain or loss in power with the combination method relative to a single statistic is asymmetric in its favor. Depending on the power of each individual test, the combination method can give more power than any single test or give power that is closer to the test with the most power. The versatility of the method is that it can combine P values from different test statistics for analysis at different times. The robustness of results suggests that inference from group sequential trials can be strengthened with the use of combined tests.","inCitations":["614bc652d9a8d746f03366e2b7d2c1012b177af7","d0d6f17ef7fec826966266f234b8a87170c4cb46"],"title":"Robust inference for group sequential trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1800"}

Computational statistics","paperAbstract":"Variable selection plays an essential role in regression analysis as it identifies important variables that associated with outcomes and is known to improve predictive accuracy of resulting models. Variable selection methods have been widely investigated for fully observed data. However, in the presence of missing data, methods for variable selection need to be carefully designed to account for missing data mechanisms and statistical techniques used for handling missing data. Since imputation is arguably the most popular method for handling missing data due to its ease of use, statistical methods for variable selection that are combined with imputation are of particular interest. These methods, valid used under the assumptions of missing at random (MAR) and missing completely at random (MCAR), largely fall into three general strategies. The first strategy applies existing variable selection methods to each imputed dataset and then combine variable selection results across all imputed datasets. The second strategy applies existing variable selection methods to stacked imputed datasets. The third variable selection strategy combines resampling techniques such as bootstrap with imputation. Despite recent advances, this area remains under-developed and offers fertile ground for further research.","inCitations":["b3b5b60fb7ee8c16b5eb34e60bd9d6f05a9c3d2b","6f9f15e7e363af8f908a7cd14c875cf3da7aab09"],"title":"Variable Selection in the Presence of Missing Data: Imputation-based Methods.","doi":"10.1002/wics.1402"}

Motivated by this question, extensions of classical central limit theorems are developed under the conditions of special relativity. The results are related to CLTs on locally compact Lie groups developed by Wehn, Stroock and Varadhan, but in this special case the asymptotic distribution has an explicit form that is readily seen to exhibit lognormal tail behavior.","inCitations":["aa4d4ac94d6db8a1646c9d1296c4b3fb0ec932c2"],"title":"Central limit theorems under special relativity.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2014.12.028"}

Since drug development is often done by institutions that work on multiple drugs simultaneously, the present work focused on optimum choices for rates of false positive (α) and false negative (β) results across a portfolio of PoC studies. Simple examples and a newly derived equation provided conceptual understanding of basic principles regarding optimum choices of α and β in PoC trials. In examples that incorporated realistic development costs and constraints, the levels of α and β that maximized the number of approved drugs and portfolio value varied by scenario. Optimum choices were sensitive to the probability the drug was effective and to the proportion of total investment cost prior to establishing PoC. Results of the present investigation agree with previous research in that it is important to assess optimum levels of α and β. However, the present work also highlighted the need to consider cost structure using realistic input parameters relevant to the question of interest.","inCitations":["f371e5954f92f843e0cee1ed414581ac494858fd"],"title":"A portfolio-based approach to optimize proof-of-concept clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.564340"}

Incorporation of such information can improve model fitting and variable selection. Existing group selection methods, such as the group Lasso, require correct membership. However, in practice it can be difficult to correctly specify group membership of all variables. Thus, it is important to develop group selection methods that are robust against group mis-specification. Also, it is desirable to select groups as well as individual variables in many applications. We propose a class of concave [Formula: see text]-norm group penalties that is robust to grouping structure and can perform bi-level selection. A coordinate descent algorithm is developed to calculate solutions of the proposed group selection method. Theoretical convergence of the algorithm is proved under certain regularity conditions. Comparison with other methods suggests the proposed method is the most robust approach under membership mis-specification. Simulation studies and real data application indicate that the [Formula: see text]-norm concave group selection approach achieves better control of false discovery rates. An R package grppenalty implementing the proposed method is available at CRAN.","inCitations":["10dc14f46f3e206dab2db027c13cdf26a83acf3b","ff92100806b8cae0fa92ae4acb90bbe3d3f774b7"],"title":"Concave 1-norm group selection.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu050"}
