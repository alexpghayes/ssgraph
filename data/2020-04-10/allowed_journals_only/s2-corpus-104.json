{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2005,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"A commonly used method of estimating population sensitivity is the so-called averaged d' method. In this method, the arithmetic mean of a set of individual d' is usually taken as a population sensitivity estimator. This practice ignores the fact that the individual d' itself is an estimator with an inherent variance. For observations with different levels of precision, the arithmetic mean is not the best estimator of a population parameter. It may lead to an estimate with a large variation. Another fact, which is often ignored, is that the variance of individual d' involves both between- and within-subject variations in a random effects model when population sensitivity and its level of precision are estimated. Failing to account for both components of variance leads to an underestimate of variation and an overestimate of precision for the estimator. In this paper a lognormal distribution rather than a normal distribution is assumed for individual sensitivity. An iterative weighting procedure is proposed for estimating population sensitivity on the log scale on the basis of a random effects model. An ordinary weighting procedure is proposed for estimating group sensitivity on the log scale on the basis of a fixed effects model. The levels of precision of population and group sensitivity estimators are also given. Numerical examples illustrate the estimation procedures.","inCitations":["110c8065c7a7848548f8041a4b763e848306027d"],"title":"Estimating population or group sensitivity and its precision from a set of individual d'.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X38357"}

This paper considers the moment and least squares methods for estimating the rate function from recurrent event data. With an independent censoring assumption on the recurrent event process, we study statistical properties of the proposed estimators and propose bootstrap procedures for the bandwidth selection and for the approximation of confidence intervals in the estimation of the occurrence rate function. It is identified that the moment method without resmoothing via a smaller bandwidth will produce a curve with nicks occurring at the censoring times, whereas there is no such problem with the least squares method. Furthermore, the asymptotic variance of the least squares estimator is shown to be smaller under regularity conditions. However, in the implementation of the bootstrap procedures, the moment method is computationally more efficient than the least squares method because the former approach uses condensed bootstrap data. The performance of the proposed procedures is studied through Monte Carlo simulations and an epidemiological example on intravenous drug users.","inCitations":["e6f1b55eef3bc723f795994d89e520b2a0406ca2","5728add305124757fc250cf07fcee61d21afffd2","453050d964a0cb3ca7db730d5f9093eccdc62ac5","53a347b10fa2b6ec2b20d2ee48b763986fb5e4b0","f1f8b391ecc73e61a2a99eb66b5c9807d5d127d0","f9b52b4194191b204e30c4277800f082e1653887","9976871fe01d7bdecebc228f9d7681b24a72da6c","6e7a219aabf8ebdd928e8ff83278158a1998015d","f6197ae9f64c43d6f8db0d88323c99755c188278"],"title":"Kernel Estimation of Rate Function for Recurrent Event Data.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9469.2005.00416.x"}

In this setting, the causal effect is only well defined for the principal stratum of subjects who would live regardless of the exposure. Motivated by gerontologic researchers interested in understanding the causal effect of vision loss on emotional distress in a population with a high mortality rate, we investigate the effect among those who would live both with and without vision loss. Since this subpopulation is not readily identifiable from the data and vision loss is not randomized, we introduce a set of scientifically driven assumptions to identify the causal effect. Since these assumptions are not empirically verifiable, we embed our methodology within a sensitivity analysis framework. We apply our method using the first three rounds of survey data from the Salisbury Eye Evaluation, a population-based cohort study of older adults. We also present a simulation study that validates our method.","inCitations":["ca06de731c71119d428d564a8ad3b0a851b4cae9","223f55b9d9fb721ebbf8c28aaef299b10be13f9b","bf188e201288e1c7a0d61a32abdd41ea78aa913f","c7e6362de5bcc7f85f542fefed7499ef2bbdfb9e","793677195cb56a059e34a97d1cf4adaca281b9be","edd7a8a0711d779c863be407b1d5ed6014bc269c","e188a200c48b63d12fff4e580bfea04963ba763b","0e50561e06f4610ef41dd89331eaf8f1dd500e30","e9f2c17f1a32a031c7e8511c430be8a809d6af1f","1a14e3a947d76e1ffef42b2caf1f525e2e59c012","56511e3feceb8b6a198e1ce4476fee63a6d5ceae","ace10022666a598d17b4f8e65891e300bf0bcb87","d772a781116d64c4c30145c921f3ccd7e12bf1f2","252ab6006a0bf8436370942898d8c447cc179953","1cf4d969d0e6d85f123da833757d640158e8fe93","88fb3bfcb63fa36b4f1b08f8e034c30ee460b18c","d1fe926799b65adba95c43c532b194c45cf9cb4b","4b71483833b7f52a0ec7eedf8140388fcddb6929","4326eabbf42ef8ed9ccfc04e6df3058ea1618fab","9c9ce8f34016ffb422cec215c70dab1ebd0b3554","87a5c34a1882815073940505ed9e97762e008ee3","d4864475c0bfff0fa2b25d15a3e005f5e5ab6b64","33469e9e60f715a118b078cc0eb0c4f53c17709d","c3fa80b02967e660520fc7013f94bebf07f0eab5","8778a20c52a8146490b6e5ca8df69e1143dbd68b","1bef9ff36e9e33742b8751c8e244efdf32f28c1b","a5df45acec1b65a24e4d14832c0e757508ab8276","ec820837ad5ca45e09587cf250243d72c85a36a0","4c05f821ce566a82a776c1b2b61512a892fbdf13","9d09584d5c86e2a16a72a8f7225c507fc852a2a1","c420909bafbd812a7a132cf0b8f898c5a3c51c56","999dbeb0d23ff04619a21f335b2e96c098bf8e7b","6bd85fb3df17b9142ec417ec2551ea8200705153","8a5a63aee29045884de71283b875092325942834","9c0d4280ebb79a1283fe4c1dbbbea0b0f6d361e5","74738fc917f86a8aa053ced4f662f73e9d645569","c5d4f6c1ed6247d5bd68451091842359d13ffaf1","1b8539b2b0cdcecc1f6c690721bbafb66abca328","37c024fdde760fd22293c9721e2216e1222a923f","886fc0d4cc21bff424ccf8dcc1cf3557820aa960","955db77a23e2628e28da8edcc3c6ca39c1093985"],"title":"Causal inference for non-mortality outcomes in the presence of death.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl027"}

In a Gaussian graphical model, an off-diagonal zero entry in the concentration matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) implies the conditional independence of two corresponding variables, given all other variables. A number of methods have been proposed to estimate a sparse large-scale Gaussian graphical model or, equivalently, a sparse large-scale concentration matrix. In practice, the graph structure to be estimated is often partially identified by other sources or a pre-screening. In this paper, we propose a simple modification of existing methods to take into account this information in the estimation. We show that the partially identified dependent structure reduces the error in estimating the dependent structure. We apply the proposed method to estimating the gene regulatory network from lung cancer data, where protein-protein interactions are partially identified from the human protein reference database. The application shows that proposed method identified many important cancer genes as hub genes in the constructed lung cancer network. In addition, we validated the prognostic importance of a newly identified cancer gene, PTPN13, in four independent lung cancer datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method could facilitate studying underlying lung cancer mechanisms and identifying reliable biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis.","inCitations":["94deb86a5f26ba9ed86b8137c04bbf85f20536f8","b1de736cb0f265446cd584391c5579eda0986955","d13c6d1f6a274b17592ebc124fe611dfc684a5cf","993695b43588db96fb1205d919f7fc6ef6654e16","e70e000d8ad60b1a73760a106812b87cb9cd27bc","6c9d8c3f66a7c3cd7e2cdc98558af5301e477e5c","d0f4021d67b7ad04d55ad34aa75ce80d14cfb876"],"title":"Statistical completion of a partially identified graph with applications for the estimation of gene regulatory networks.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv013"}

In this paper, we propose a generalization of the Cox PH model in terms of the cumulative hazard function taking a form similar to the Cox PH model, with the extension that the baseline cumulative hazard function is raised to a power function. Our model allows for interaction between covariates and the baseline hazard and it also includes, for the two sample problem, the case of two Weibull distributions and two extreme value distributions differing in both scale and shape parameters. The partial likelihood approach can not be applied here to estimate the model parameters.

Since nonlinear association between two sets of multivariate variables can be arbitrarily complex and even intractable in general, we aim at seeking a principal one-dimensional association structure where a response index is fully characterized by a single predictor index. The functional relation between the two single-indices is left unspecified, allowing flexible exploration of any potential nonlinear association. We argue that such double single index association is meaningful and easy to interpret, and the rest of the multi-dimensional dependence structure can be treated as nuisance in model estimation. We investigate the estimation and inference of both indices and the regression function, and derive the asymptotic properties of our procedure. We illustrate the numerical performance in finite samples and demonstrate the usefulness of the modeling and estimation procedure in a multi-covariate multi-response problem concerning concrete.","inCitations":["6869ec83925ce29e44337c745307224c53aa7e32"],"title":"Analysis of Double Single Index Models.","doi":"10.1111/sjos.12238"}

Biometrics 58, 21-29), we consider an approach that has a causal interpretation and develop a Bayesian estimation strategy for surrogate validation when the joint distribution of potential surrogate and outcome measures is multivariate normal. From the joint conditional distribution of the potential outcomes of T, given the potential outcomes of S, we propose surrogacy validation measures from this model. As the model is not fully identifiable from the data, we propose some reasonable prior distributions and assumptions that can be placed on weakly identified parameters to aid in estimation. We explore the relationship between our surrogacy measures and the surrogacy measures proposed by Prentice (1989. Surrogate endpoints in clinical trials: definition and operational criteria.

One uncertainty in applications of the multiple imputation to randomized controlled trials with longitudinal data is whether the imputation should be carried out across all subjects simultaneously or by treatment group separately, which leads to two different strategies for building imputation procedures and/or models. Indeed, it has not been sufficiently addressed and well-documented how the two imputation strategies work in the analysis of the longitudinal data. We consider situations in the presence of heteroscedasticity between treatment groups and conducted extensive simulation studies to examine how the choice of imputation strategy had impacts on the estimation of treatment effects under an assumption of missing at random mechanism. The choice of analysis model was also assessed. The simulation studies suggested that in the presence of heteroscedasticity, the separate imputation by treatment group was robust enough to provide unbiased and precise estimation of the treatment effects; in contrast, the simultaneous imputation, which is frequently used in applications, led to serious biases and poor coverage probabilities of 95% confidence interval for the treatment effects. The heteroscedasticity should be dealt with in more careful manners for the longitudinal data analysis, and if it could be the case in hand, we recommend using the separate imputation by treatment group, as well as applying unequal variance analysis methods for complete data with imputed values. The methods were illustrated with data from two real examples of pediatric research and mental health research.","inCitations":["03d6c5faaca2f44fb24e18c9370bebbfdb39ad66"],"title":"Multiple imputation for longitudinal data in the presence of heteroscedasticity between treatment groups.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2019.1632878"}

The change of support problem is concerned with inference about the values of a variable at points or blocks different from those at which it has been observed. In the context of block data which can be sensibly viewed as averaging over point data, we propose a unifying approach for prediction from points to points, points to blocks, blocks to points, and blocks to blocks. The approach includes fully Bayesian kriging. We also extend our approach to the the case of spatio-temporal data, wherein a judicious specification of spatio-temporal association enables manageable computation. Exemplification of the static spatial case is provided using a dataset of point-level ozone measurements in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. The dynamic spatial case is illustrated using a temporally extended version of this dataset, enabling comparison at the common time point.*To whom correspondence should be addressed.","inCitations":["e16bf5a57f934cab93206783e8c6a1d3bd7840ba","041abb88a58dff98bc8f72c93b8def084ee99550","b7296a9e0746ebe129d3be1d62e32a30dc3f72e4","a8a0f85f230d61aa9654d27d642bdeb4ceb5ed8c","6170c8b1896a2ec90fd5a9ba68fd26fb9683a125","935651274dd8bd47c360af5573e54564a0a2b321","c1cadddf30b4cf5aafad119ff2c543d94942c67e","206f09ef538d6fd5bff075edfb005d9db67b9592","a852e15e9b669094e9640f7032d4ce0152fa40c9","92a1311ab531f57f3da847240f9a93e9e1af31e7","498f9d6ddd0f1703c847abccc03e469be0d9bd21","6c752792d955f578a8c078d181a0632bdac95f44","5fced5a598a9ee5a83659c9451b57af71c2de587","e734a911237bc41f119ee81d034f55c5cd7bc1f2","746554301fc69990cead47831552c67eefd259cb","c8e6aaf8ca6b15e4a4253bff330f98e9006deb5c","3f490771ddd4f02ff5510c4c326b8334e3ecff2b","beb76974abbae5f218afaada2c4b65de663f4ae7","48940fa7a9299bdc19a2f1949c741ec91edbcfc1","2d4d6434a35e88d8f641f9e1fbee59544c4b3594","ce2246968ff3cf0e640d57aee01a3e6e277b9eeb","a0f9b2be3ee07d6ca136d72a5680e5cfc20fccb6","291ffa2841a9b7958d9f3a9ef24728fccca058bb","d10f4e4f3764569769f3e55fa684147e2aff2e70","ff7497555156fac769585f4cefea5176ad3a81cd","30f709eddb9af56cd879d1b6ddfdfa3b7f5ae799","487965e1d6acefc1295e3d43600e16a11fb9ed24","e5e6bf6fa2172db80253df25b5c192cbca731f5d","f14bd2312624077c38bdaac27c7c43381ff1c8a9","56131e92317424ac6ad45d87bf9ccb0232eed725","f21a45f03b5ad2e0fd095872abed53225158842e","fb3f64c4caf644251ae0a468f6856b54ab3dfeeb","e420e146a693955775c1ef7d889d189c03f3f64c","116fe35f53a4a418554162c736fa177ac369077f","bcacfc71b11cb91e0fc6718fd22c12f4371acfe3","b7bd6b6a061ad2b4f9726e5db60249ccfcfb05f5","d77f364de69f1989cd1f035ec127b71aa9d8a88a","cd6ce57f6f84c8187327349aa56f7ad730d665c4","c58105aee33a905e055ffe44d9f3ed2cab2d482f","88cc7fb656244b35c084c4a27fdd3f958449ae8e","e16e031a6030152e9ef23df4d60ca0d110a3565f","2da3c59df148ed6018a0633f21523364995efa29","6a33fa43e07926bd2acb5fc9f2318849d94f1fc6","4c461af8b27fdf6096cb5864fe5553b4382857d8","60295d3ecd3a1e84525a22d81552016dcfbdada6","f11484730c2752fae01781f5c7a46145ab0af68b","4d3fd79753b47e351a3a18f779e3ce87283a5eb5","85b70d43e0ceaa3e21af77783bdb60836851bab5","ad5112f69a0796d62e125c5d11977bf6d3f22b47","cd5dd3a2e18be51774b650ee499a031a95178f33","402e62c5ec741e62b60dcb4692b740852bdeb902","c30b75e4f2149e8c8a334468bac2d470d4107cd8","1ba52083fc9e273cc38e7d3ccb1e59d7c59c9e4c","72bd98dccd49bef706944a4cff81de26922b59f5","c4f49826c9ba1ccb226d56198cfdae20dc511326","0e471022646748372800be966c1758e84cbb43e1","d5bf9c8bb281dc99eec39967ad462bc0f98fb7d4","87774347413df332e80efaed262929efa26ee6ae","4eb96cc57fb2285ba0abc87ee04c6cd9100b91bd","3b9bca634edba11f48ded0259369127484627e60","3cb6c9b6a73bebace4f071d5a6b2aa792e70cb15","e114c5e2f822a63285b3ad38c533db642a1fb689","1346ffcb668c8fbdd0d98ce458110521d90b949c","a10b18f2eeaf8d7322e133ade85d0f057b8141dd","3956a69fcbcfe5318b897821d49a6d2ab1559768","ce63c82825639be95dd04229508f6c05151e3dea","90f19f77da2d26d9bc1ed23fbdbb67a1a396a46e","5bad8ee7a6e6d956e12f2b556d4db4937cc2489f","b2afd758f87eb99a3332ae093f88a6c4d524a6b5","cca0cc8be9eb0e15f53c6c8e054311185f455807","f0aae9dbd70b018e0aba5bdee3ac1b691019c01a","52628c848b71ea7c0ce2ecac453e1a7c792b61cf","4b06b1ce3d6b6e64c74c0a64c98d01537f748206","0e463fb54941d44abf51e31384353b218d787ab1","a1f216b7cd454f2ce7522ce52d32e7b77e71ff8c","13293a9e08ec8555bfcaa1e7a26e2b9b4c25b127","4ce983c612ae7e8cf9aeac0140015b1922702f31","1099c25847c42c2e99bc36716a3f5d55c007f0e9","f218a22ac259f4f36577f00a657b5866de81cc77","a579a6bcb07cee461758133ae31e291fb5035905","8065d8d3134b97e5417bea68c012e6be40c8b304","d772b9fb0ef0c50e100306909b4d41f895fa2d9b","14111a6c16d3a3618e28a79a61e49626c4dee191","8194016caf17238774dccb44f81e7a0b606a253d","c9d2b6f26455629ccc60b53361636eac5a1a500b","44cf017cb097567abd6fe2902abb463c4c24b76c","eb1cecbf94f422eab98c68ea3f475cf3cfe8d101","11dbaf5adab17db517c9826fc251b261ba76a921","b5921a99623f4faae6355903df3d39c44827136d","0d45721d4cb0ff7e37e88e06cf113b224c2c2755","84c38ce983a3a1ad9d4692939264417c79d2cdfc","8229459a80d6023bc5078861988b816f85bf452c","36db8c23e351fa50fced2965e43bd99672bf8467","2d2cfb6ba06d3e98d89e9e2946aa62d248205db3","094e0288f663ab0a2d31bfa33e7aa69fd7e44cbf","d0dab14c0653084755d81e53139d6a09efbecec5","4cc9777a857ab92f2e9c57f1917c0c42a15eb902","d7cd25e86a6cef4b0c673b5d07ef712810f42a9f","4c90207d8192343b9a46bda944ee22580813612f","1aa5caa3e08852b8a8da831367142fcfecfb448c","30a1ed9175c6ea791c54ff668d811b075afef71d"],"title":"On the change of support problem for spatio-temporal data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/2.1.31"}

Traditionally, a one-sided hypothesis is used to make statistical inference, and the actual Type I error rate has to be computed over the parameter space of the null hypothesis. The monotonicity property is a fundamental property that guarantees the actual Type I error rate occurring at the boundary. One-arm two-stage designs are considered in this article. We theoretically proved this important property when the final threshold value of a design is less than the first-stage sample size together with another weak condition being satisfied. The method used in this article may finally lead to the final complete proof of this property in the future. We also numerically proved that the monotonicity property is satisfied for designs with the first-stage and the second-stage sample sizes from 10 to 100.","inCitations":["f1d6c3ef2efd082d425e0bf75332030e128021ec","0b7bbbe02b3ec27d8300439202dbfe11e31e52a2"],"title":"Boundary problem in Simon's two-stage clinical trial designs.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1148716"}

Most existing variable selection techniques focused on selecting variables that are important for prediction, therefore some variables that are poor in prediction but are critical for decision-making may be ignored. A qualitative interaction of a variable with treatment arises when treatment effect changes direction as the value of this variable varies. The qualitative interaction indicates the importance of this variable for decision-making. Gunter, Zhu and Murphy (2011) proposed S-score which characterizes the magnitude of qualitative interaction of each variable with treatment individually. In this article, we developed a sequential advantage selection method based on the modified S-score. Our method selects qualitatively interacted variables sequentially, and hence excludes marginally important but jointly unimportant variables or vice versa. The optimal treatment regime based on variables selected via joint model is more comprehensive and reliable. With the proposed stopping criteria, our method can handle a large amount of covariates even if sample size is small. Simulation results show our method performs well in practical settings. We further applied our method to data from a clinical trial for depression.","inCitations":["c732686f5595d16e67866f85c49cf35573f14aaf","022f6fc9e894a32af562bf9b67ba0d3ca4aa640d","dd9593749a50de32cae9146484244a350a978f80","43ef6f75c7b0aaf61cbebf7796041bacc27a4b34","047098cc418f62b6e9e660619fdf4197d5b89847","6ceabbf89f548d72ddd7aa20155e0897e41e756d","d290797a05041405bfd179c397e571cc3dba5374","e5ac6c0f6859e9397132de17f7ae5f0b3154e417","b5da62520ab8383a507a5ae78b4b199146cee02d"],"title":"Sequential advantage selection for optimal treatment regime.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS849"}

In this paper, we develop a model to estimate inter-rater and intra-rater reliability when each of the two observers has the opportunity to obtain a pair of replicate measurements on each subject. The model is analogous to the nested beta-binomial model proposed by Rosner (1989, 1992). We show that the gain in precision obtained from increasing the number of measurements per rater from one to two may allow fewer subjects to be included in the study with no net loss in efficiency for estimating the inter-rater reliability.","inCitations":["4c68f707c72757139437c30793710450ea5c3b0b","9cbc64a9fee4d23ca5f281b5281630d6967027b0","abde0c29337b269ff8e77510f900a5c0a221d807","cba2a943baaac5c61f80fcd286416413c71e577d","95be4c3b9a2fcf2ae79c412791c00eee2cf59e21","60f08638b168e8f72e932d5f03d3fa95c1a1a31c","6c86f36744dfc5c5ec359a2878c31914dd2240fc","85bb624a5bf47ad1d4a94d28c381889f3f27834b"],"title":"Efficiency considerations in the analysis of inter-observer agreement.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/2.3.323"}

The proposed model is capable of dealing with longitudinal data from unknown heterogeneous populations. As applied to longitudinal clinical trials, for example, the model can distinguish subgroups of treatment response. Use of the proposed model is illustrated by analyzing data from two psychiatric clinical trials. The first includes depressed patients assigned to drug treatment who are repeatedly measured in terms of their level of depression. The second trial examined schizophrenic patients longitudinally who were assigned to either a drug or placebo condition. For both, the random-effects mixture model allows an assessment of whether patients comprise distinct populations in terms of their treatment response. Based on parameter estimates of the mixture model, ample evidence for a mixture of response to treatment is observed for both datasets.","inCitations":["0e0c6a4d4c5f4c3bcbba52aca0f9bcf797dc20d8","de17465af3dcdc52f1ac9a1686b8c3737cae57e2","9a153a02a01f79bd996c5a83d82545c377bb59af","c911689a591d66456b4a2f897c36664096e3ee6d","4cb0cf82ae2c881437ed07743a64f95ae666e926","657e6dfeec1034bf31a3d95bb1ce3c0308aa5bd4","c9dd4c550bef628295fc3f95cc1dcd7e870c6b99","3de7081c15f2c447d3367e4048087ca7bf83308a","1840b12c050fa5be7c562a04006ee799efae87c4","d5bc72e502c04c548185e853ff6a205fddbae189","dedb5b1960f1c5934289fdb5dc6fe5c84f8c4fca","36ea62fe1a3c55a538299a11c599a952a36bf876","b61a940b8fadac4eee185d1c73d0b26e3a467027","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","f99daa111b7fd5a48313cc5962cb9e1fb05405e2","552dd9e50891c5313c82b0337d2d4047fc2c899c","ba232cecfeb75db9ba680c309d6a37bafe1e6c0a","8bf3a9890d90eed8cd1e68a6d3afff0b3b775b3e","592214151bd49647f867ddd5184d28c9997ec7b0","047b09af534cca308e2acdd02c0346759e1a2997","910e74a25d869febcf448bf2704626d276640463","05e80fb407cf274815e80fc819e385263bebae2b"],"title":"A random-effects mixture model for classifying treatment response in longitudinal clinical trials.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120008848"}

In this setting, we consider application of the four traditional tests. The proposed testing procedures are investigated theoretically for densely observed functional covariates when the number of principal components diverges. Using the theoretical distribution of the tests under the alternative hypothesis, we develop a procedure for sample size calculation in the context of functional linear regression. The four tests are further compared numerically for both densely and sparsely observed noisy functional data in simulation experiments and using two real data applications.","inCitations":["15423f224f640625a00d3a900f1b2dc28f54ddfd","e0e5f26a1a9d85c4a98af98a2cad115c3cb44351","0b2d9b14a04a0fd2b1f628a6f0ec2ca337d6e475","14a63d1313121a13efb8645e5c13e7421ab212d9","60db0e5b782c16124f0a8c036cafa7c0784eb729","f60f23bdc2ec695224e7df30ee3770b0c02e4028","f3bc919386a105aab6cc25aa33ccff4e74f34876","d3decced316848b42ab6998a9acc14ceac5ff594","998e54a0cf8bec478bb5224a4beed2a112ecb03a","d24ace1e4a06357091acd59706ff731a6c9c72fb","a7978c1067ba8f85049a659638a5b6519e9a7d22","df0f5e441f06032c833593ffaafe3cfa9db4a1c9","7192dfa0b5d18d755f1855b1f970d81875378e96","b9340fc87dc69b655a556334d839b78fb8205e52"],"title":"Classical Testing in Functional Linear Models.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2016.1231806"}

For cost efficiency, we may often employ a cluster randomized trial (CRT), in which randomized units are clusters of patients. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to encounter data in which there are patients not complying with their assigned treatment. Under the Dirichlet multinomial model, we have developed a test statistic for assessing non-inferiority based on the OR between two treatments under a CRT with noncompliance. We have further derived a sample size formula accounting for both noncompliance and the intraclass correlation for a desired power 1 - β of detecting non-inferiority with respect to the OR at a nominal α level. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we have evaluated the performance of the proposed test statistic and sample size formula. Finally, we use the CRT studying the effect of vitamin A supplementation on mortality among preschool children to illustrate the use of the sample size formula given here.","inCitations":["52ecac6de4c9052dea33b55efa9f6992aa2aaf6c","3f29bfc4cee171e69e6e2c594a6f52d8ae62c568","240ab744a83e114dc2c15a3f774e6e3c12bf1caf","f34d58ab76ceaef311b192cefc795f1e837bc57f"],"title":"Test non-inferiority and sample size determination based on the odds ratio under a cluster randomized trial with noncompliance.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003602623"}

Bench-marking against rolling six, we find that the R-TPI design is as fast in completing clinical trials but with fewer toxicity events and higher chance of finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the single scenario laid out in the 2008 rolling six publication. We also find that in a broad setting involving multiple scenarios, R-TPI is generally faster, safer, and more reliable than standard designs. R-TPI is a general design that can be applied to adult and pediatric Phase I trials. It reduces the length of trial duration, leads to safer trials with fewer toxicity events, and maintains relatively a high chance of identifying the MTD.","inCitations":["1b78a8d4d3d3e86d316a8e175303e5b633e717c2"],"title":"R-TPI: rolling toxicity probability interval design to shorten the duration and maintain safety of phase I trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2019.1577683"}

Useful summary measures which properly evaluate the discriminative ability of diagnostic markers are critical for this purpose. Literature and existing software, for example, R packages nicely cover summary measures for diagnostic markers used for the binary case (e.g., healthy vs. diseased). An intermediate population at an early disease stage usually exists between the healthy and the fully diseased population in many disease processes. Supporting utilities for three-group diagnostic tests are highly desired and important for identifying patients at the early disease stage for timely treatments. However, application packages which provide summary measures for three ordinal groups are currently lacking. This paper focuses on two summary measures of diagnostic accuracy-volume under the receiver operating characteristic surface and the extended Youden index, with three diagnostic groups. We provide the R package DiagTest3Grp to estimate, under both parametric and nonparametric assumptions, the two summary measures and the associated variances, as well as the optimal cut-points for disease diagnosis. An omnibus test for multiple markers and a Wald test for two markers, on independent or paired samples, are incorporated to compare diagnostic accuracy across biomarkers. Sample size calculation under the normality assumption can be performed in the R package to design future diagnostic studies. A real world application evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of neuropsychological markers for Alzheimer's disease is used to guide readers through step-by-step implementation of DiagTest3Grp to demonstrate its utility.","inCitations":["3938795b2ea68a20570bc0264857ea168bfae554","0d384e8d28eb5ebeccc3d73c478bc7503c070bc0","d39bdc2e6c769d1f1f09d4f2541dad55724d2e05","1c7fe803c0879bf8ef79bb9097e3e1b20031ad5e","ff5f5928bb0b17d4707dcf871866041c06932409","08be75c471a7e228e6445f92e0c488863eafeab2","fe8ba67f733ac86bdb546096229753d1e7de77ad","1ba26db3e52f1cfbaa24a9932d8a9987135e3845","11bd8513b89eb1aa13e050823b7f0e05387480b9","c7df2a3cb633590564434c6e0ddd02f9debfc38e","ecb1d7645cfe0081aed8d763765811fc0cb49a78","bb626658511506828420ddb70a8f509c9c6c5bed","0a6afd4d9d4a3bbc098f41221a0543e19e441633","a0435226403408953d1cb41f46018e5bdc711bf1","f452861d03ff232acb548fb869e9130e9b013007","28d1fc5265f02731015e331396521c9ac68cb0d6","ec29e44143c22afef6041a5ef0134d276f3a2d40","3cfd418648025093e943f478e7f8120fe822d8d2","b11a2c683f73ac8fc0ee690be2183767ea6f287e"],"title":"DiagTest3Grp: An R Package for Analyzing Diagnostic Tests with Three Ordinal Groups.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v051.i03"}

Motivated by the Naturalistic Teenage Driving Study (NTDS), which represents the exact opposite situation, we examine standard and propose new methodology for marginal analysis of longitudinal count data in a small number of very long sequences. We consider standard methods based on generalized estimating equations, under working independence or an appropriate correlation structure, and find them unsatisfactory for dealing with time-dependent covariates when the counts are low. For this situation, we explore a within-cluster resampling (WCR) approach that involves repeated analyses of random subsamples with a final analysis that synthesizes results across subsamples. This leads to a novel WCR method which operates on separated blocks within subjects and which performs better than all of the previously considered methods. The methods are applied to the NTDS data and evaluated in simulation experiments mimicking the NTDS.","inCitations":["3f094410a88f5a0fc443aee974273e427fca8aef","8ba93dc38a4cd5e55c2ccfa905c0e532c8546934","aa1c34e8321847cab741a6d864d9c174a6484742"],"title":"Marginal Analysis of Longitudinal Count Data in Long Sequences: Methods and Applications to A Driving Study.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS507"}

It combines the performance of many weak classifiers to produce a powerful committee, and its validity can be explained by additive modeling and maximum likelihood. The method has very general applications, especially for high-dimensional predictors. For example, it can be applied to distinguish cancer samples from healthy control samples by using antibody microarray data. Microarray data are often high-dimensional and many of them are incomplete. One natural idea is to impute a missing variable based on the observed predictors. However, the calculation of imputation for high-dimensional predictors with missing data may be rather tedious. In this paper, we propose 2 conditional mean imputation methods. They can be applied to the situation even when a complete-case subset does not exist. Simulation results indicate that the proposed methods are superior than other naive methods. We apply the methods to a pancreatic cancer study in which serum protein microarrays are used for classification.","inCitations":["b24114325299b30a5dd7c526334d65a5dc21e5ae","52ac9ae9138ee18292728f91290b9f0793f3dc98","0a5b0ee94e88da65b289c4feadbcf9583663794d","a877e4bebd1d883031a8d34cfe0c2a0cdfe37642","8ede971f536a473b79c7d59973e52cffba513044","3e10b6bd221ad8762f23679cbd7ec79745a44707"],"title":"Boosting with missing predictors.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp052"}
