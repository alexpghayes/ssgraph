We construct transformations that (i) facilitate improved formulation of the optimal design problems into SDP problems, (ii) enable us to extend SDP methodology to find optimal designs from linear models to nonlinear multi-response models with multiple factors and (iii) correct erroneously reported optimal designs in the literature caused by formulation issues. We also derive invariance properties of optimal designs and their dependence on the covariance matrix of the correlated errors, which are helpful for reducing the computation time for finding optimal designs. Our applications include finding A-, A s -, c- and D-optimal designs for multi-response multi-factor polynomial models, locally c- and D-optimal designs for a bivariate E max response model and for a bivariate Probit model useful in the biosciences.","inCitations":["f02addb317a535d1da6d1f8027e739b211cece83","dc81ccb413df2bbdbd8b63fe3a4d0671a766905d","b0aac8572c272795b1ce881d82b945992ce301c0"],"title":"Optimal Designs for Multi-Response Nonlinear Regression Models With Several Factors via Semidefinite Programming.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2018.1476250"}

If the cluster is found in the new dataset, the cluster is said to be \"reproducible\" and may be biologically significant. Classifying a new datum to a previously defined cluster can be seen as predicting which of the previously defined clusters is most similar to the new datum. If the new data classified to a cluster are similar, molecularly or clinically, to the data already present in the cluster, then the cluster is reproducible and the corresponding prediction accuracy is high. Here, we take advantage of the connection between reproducibility and prediction accuracy to develop a validation procedure for clusters found in datasets independent of the one in which they were characterized. We define a cluster quality measure called the \"in-group proportion\" (IGP) and introduce a general procedure for individually validating clusters. Using simulations and real breast cancer datasets, the IGP is compared to four other popular cluster quality measures (homogeneity score, separation score, silhouette width, and weighted average discrepant pairs score). Moreover, simulations and the real breast cancer datasets are used to compare the four versions of the validation procedure which all use the IGP, but differ in the way in which the null distributions are generated. We find that the IGP is the best measure of prediction accuracy, and one version of the validation procedure is the more widely applicable than the other three. An implementation of this algorithm is in a package called \"clusterRepro\" available through The Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.r-project.org).","inCitations":["62af8d01a052a5b4933c2a0106b677ef9f4ab821","1b8a219e3230661663b8390be01431d037387f53","d380126e3a3aa709d0ed03e1647c7f5cb20e7f23","667c3b8751ce0638b02a63883c1420f91e884563","419258dc8b5e79f6a48485688d6f5cbbfa77a5de","894ae7249ffb31efd1449c7d8cd61e708fddfbf1","a6a033bc76f35510cfdc83cc90794f181cef3d2f","9e79df2a0aa9f25f91eb1b7e087d603196263f7c","c220c4ec8b20c7164fd0abc386bb1d2689ea8ad8","44dfd0859b54d03b2279455b97b5ad1d798234fa","5abfda7889e23547f539425da8a421d1126c5b54","267d465b16bf3c8a4009abb87901193aa09a0216","b7b7760cbb5a7595f1ae286e447c3072e29384d0","23fc4f0fec45c0e419af0f1bec905514f98a99f0","b547a1caba0556147b85f0e4a6664a7a7420202b","0745cb28a4c9c668bea51b085423c2fb5df019d8","07af67755fe84fad5d7c9c17836323286d8239a0","60ac1e7f47594fb7634caff2c2fc330da48c621b","b411cbe2ad1b39f661d7501f68f25e1facb1eae2","860a68aefa63c96452dcbd09ec2625877690d56a","546b377ba92ba669082ab7b7c69443d81ad136f7","f144afe910586a2fd59c6a2ef256548bed0a85a4","eda6a2534446c6612d035ae1a6f1a29c28a605ca","b603def890e864ce926b4cbf6a06312b4fa646aa","55f834ede5b6a39a7a64a826288b1063d32f3c04","43f864ad124110cde3c128842098f9401cc9d2fd","e5bb3c3c4091b7634d49946184660f87921c7005","9be72ddd1248ac7d4d6221acfd456c0ea8446b9b","4c2fa0beb2ece83bf3373eedc6902f1e3b5ec328","065c52d6d3e221af012cd300daafd8348b3f64e2","894215e8b46d13780d7118155ddce293b28c3377","2a668fcfb9db11e2f87a6d78b589a4033b8c32dd","00ab9f95d4d5ccb12f89b9bd0eddcc465356d127","ba3ac7b1bdf98747c6049b05721ce6e74a8cc79d","408dc831f10ca1ad4a413376b03894c94d90e885","59ed6e303ebf786858a9a7e0fe485376ee7e5c68","84dcc07f6052b58ac2525a3c1d78b4bea3e43c1f","eb84c8ed858622c8dd4757980c15c5fe9ef825e3","1ed0725cb7c14ebff452e2743693e6c7d78a7419","ef2e568b16a1edfc577c503fe2c9b181c59a6cc5","0676a4b84194bbba39496da2aa750f950c293d17","983afc50aa0334e862d8a58249ed7bf5ab1f8093","d0d897177681dcfca04d0a1dc4ede1cc4857d278","03a630cd8f7e9a3b67216d354e13c7713dfa63fb","78ed912041029631e2db66a37973c6559a5a47e7","69fdbbc5bebfc9007bc36397d2543246f60674da","f3f573355467768bf2ab0321e2c6ebb371b67b11","53cd87f267f94d96c918d4b6c34e826c6df4a842","070cd66707d8fecaa5d8a9a08a1cae551b91201d","dfe6539755b37150182b38e4b043f043b2c2cdd4","4a03b83ee5f0502b68c1b016c03a6a6e006b224d","49ad10952a3b9763df8f8cb7486c8966f0983e39","1ec3d29367c0b36637a3a4df5240f215822f45fb","f8c2adf046b79992160da5db94eaee9d19949261","a0d7b416d8d29faa461209756bd910e9ec1c54d4","9696648220080d5881d0ef2ad1818994bb6f2a9c","b4d0eb9faafdca0a0d1205d8dc512c00eef06bad","38bd6c1a94302ed45489f396d1066530a8367405","b931e956072fc3ec3f4ede8f645ec213874b2dd5","997f33f4bb395bb17087000ca5ac86cb2f7e52c2","3c5f578f76e10503138f0c624b2312d716af510c","09f4168ca6bd5a90da6903d894409818db1a8dc3","782fae54b8fe759215fd5c3ea3aea86b05b31fc8","6ecee4a174b7d856332488811c981212294f04d3","56b2b309a359edcbc5c390d2a4a8dc876b799b2d","fa699d6e7e4497d33bac99264e94cb4e87075db6","e37660146dc4a6274818cbfa4fc5bf6ef1a6f30d","a3e67f4153b9ea4195d6d16ce3f866186b01917d","2e6f2e35a08445924ddc4cd4648c5c680531ef4b","7ee21c47517b2d9298f11aca640745af9389374c","4f3e9c92b25c2843b094ff32ce0e89da0d04b1de","f6519f1286a2050977cd8151381d5eb2d8492388","45dafa94048f3047c30e91efa6cd5edc55ba9011","58645d46434a125d84446dda1eae253fcba94fa6","95de1fa3f9c19ee800db44db901fb59b6695268f","8df411e84c1329d9941105e81c72484a575da9c0","cc19c958986719793b61b5bb0a9614b4dd092908","e5f3c6bfd9cb687be6038cd5e1d7935ccd34d807","668163ed7d3aa44d19ad378077f919dfa031ab31","5c1c1d361c9b7de7e53d1383f1d5579be8f60442","3d3609aa1c279a27b657509813c7a140ecdf44d0","2c3c8228bfb5a65ef3adf69eabe5434aec10ef90"],"title":"Are clusters found in one dataset present in another dataset?","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj029"}

Such measures are usually estimated from observational studies on siblings, parent-offspring, extended pedigrees or twins. When the trait of interest is quantitative (e.g. Blood pressures, body mass index, blood glucose levels, etc.) efficient likelihood estimation of such measures is feasible under the assumption of multivariate normality of the distributions of the traits. In this case the intra-class and inter-class correlations are used to assess the similarities among family members. When the trail is measured on the binary scale, we establish a full likelihood inference on such measures among siblings, parents, and parent-offspring. We illustrate the methodology on nuclear family data where the trait is the presence or absence of hypertension.","inCitations":["df316e9e30408e5460bfe7197bffc359bd76ecfd"],"title":"Measures of Family Resemblance for Binary Traits: Likelihood Based Inference","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1410"}

Besides the inflation of the type-I error rate due to sample size re-estimation, the method for calculating the sample size in an interim analysis should be carefully considered because the data in each stage are mutually dependent in trials with survival data. Although the interim hazard estimate is commonly used to re-estimate the sample size, the estimate can sometimes be considerably higher or lower than the hypothesized hazard by chance. We propose an interim hazard ratio estimate that can be used to re-estimate the sample size under those circumstances. The proposed method was demonstrated through a simulation study and an actual clinical trial as an example. The effect of the shape parameter for the Weibull survival distribution on the sample size re-estimation is presented.","inCitations":["38e598295396b2c88790708af001447bebab1538","c72a87cf47beb86fcb9c28b1df8a52bd581455d2","a2a1ca1f48afe8fde3d165e767205ce8a35b5a02","1da33bcf8fbb6db490f468122aa02d72d8567b48","3cd0887766a1a22870851cd32f3e35f75ee6b85c"],"title":"Sample size re-estimation for survival data in clinical trials with an adaptive design.","doi":"10.1002/pst.469"}

The stepwise approach starts with analytical studies for assessing similarity in critical quality attributes (CQAs), which are relevant to clinical outcomes at various stages of the manufacturing process. For CQAs that are the most relevant to clinical outcomes, the FDA requires an equivalence test be performed for similarity assessment based on an equivalence acceptance criterion (EAC) that is obtained using a single test value of some selected reference lots. In practice, we often have extremely imbalanced numbers of reference and test lots available for the establishment of EAC. In this case, to assist the sponsors, the FDA proposed an idea for determining the number of reference lots and the number of test lots required in order not to have imbalanced sample sizes when establishing EAC for the equivalence test based on extensive simulation studies. Along this line, this article not only provides statistical justification of Dong, Tsong, and Weng's proposal, but also proposes an alternative method for sample size requirement for the Tier 1 equivalence test.","inCitations":["00b17200b92771aaa132d2d95165e3e8552e9ba3","758d3b409ca04a78421fb301d80f4a7f49589722"],"title":"Sample size requirement in analytical studies for similarity assessment.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1265545"}

TMLE is doubly robust, yielding consistent estimators even under misspecification of either the treatment or the outcome model. While IPW methods are known to be sensitive to near violations of the practical positivity assumption (e. g., in the case of data sparsity), the consequences of this violation in the TMLE framework for binary outcomes have been less widely investigated. As near practical positivity violations are particularly likely in high-dimensional covariate settings, a better understanding of the performance of TMLE is of particular interest for pharmcoepidemiological studies using large databases. Using plasmode and Monte-Carlo simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of TMLE compared to that of IPW estimators based on a point-exposure cohort study of the marginal causal effect of post-myocardial infarction statin use on the 1-year risk of all-cause mortality from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. A variety of treatment model specifications were considered, inducing different degrees of near practical non-positivity. Our simulation study showed that the performance of the TMLE and IPW estimators were comparable when the dimension of the fitted treatment model was small to moderate; however, they differed when a large number of covariates was considered. When a rich outcome model was included in the TMLE, estimators were unbiased. In some cases, we found irregular bias and large standard errors with both methods even with a correctly specified high-dimensional treatment model. The IPW estimator showed a slightly better root MSE with high-dimensional treatment model specifications in our simulation setting. In conclusion, for estimation of the marginal expectation of the outcome under a fixed treatment, TMLE and IPW estimators employing the same treatment model specification may perform differently due to differential sensitivity to practical positivity violations; however, TMLE, being doubly robust, shows improved performance with richer specifications of the outcome model. Although TMLE is appealing for its double robustness property, such violations in a high-dimensional covariate setting are problematic for both methods.","inCitations":["b5df55c24ef2773309a7306064da95b8e0083858","e86913e6aa8b0ec1969cc36aa8f8c965f4ff4b43"],"title":"Effect Estimation in Point-Exposure Studies with Binary Outcomes and High-Dimensional Covariate Data – A Comparison of Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0034"}

Some of these experiments, so-called encouragement designs, can be expected to have especially large amounts of noncompliance, because encouragement to take the treatment rather than the treatment itself is randomly assigned to individuals. We present an extended framework for the analysis of data from such experiments with a binary treatment, binary encouragement, and background covariates. There are two key features of this framework: we use an instrumental variables approach to link intention-to-treat effects to treatment effects and we adopt a Bayesian approach for inference and sensitivity analysis. This framework is illustrated in a medical example concerning the effects of inoculation for influenza. In this example, the analyses suggest that positive estimates of the intention-to-treat effect need not be due to the treatment itself, but rather to the encouragement to take the treatment: the intention-to-treat effect for the subpopulation who would be inoculated whether or not encouraged is estimated to be approximately as large as the intention-to-treat effect for the subpopulation whose inoculation status would agree with their (randomized) encouragement status whether or not encouraged. Thus, our methods suggest that global intention-to-treat estimates, although often regarded as conservative, can be too coarse and even misleading when taken as summarizing the evidence in the data for the effects of

The main objective of the work is to propose a multivariate receiver operating characteristic (MROC) model which linearly combines the markers to classify them into one of the two groups and also to determine an optimal cut point. Simulation studies are conducted for four sets of mean vectors and covariance matrices and a real dataset is also used to demonstrate the proposed model. Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis has also been applied to the above datasets in order to explain the ease of the proposed model.

Likelihood-ratio-test-based activation statistics are derived for both models and compared for experimental and simulated data. For a dataset from a right-hand finger-tapping experiment, the activation map obtained using complex-valued modeling more clearly identifies the primary activation region (left functional central sulcus) than the magnitude-only model. Such improved accuracy in mapping the left functional central sulcus has important implications in neurosurgical planning for tumor and epilepsy patients. Additionally, we develop magnitude and phase detrending procedures for complex-valued time series and examine the effect of spatial smoothing. These methods improve the power of complex-valued data-based activation statistics. Our results advocate for the use of the complex-valued data and the modeling of its dependence structures as a more efficient and reliable tool in fMRI experiments over the current practice of using only magnitude-valued datasets.","inCitations":["43fcc2d8273d88357733b333d4c08a5c3b4f0f99","7a5fbee2dcd3dc29cab4f80b71a8b5dd42d45072","e96c00b0095d802631a250a29c4b052f7c318f1c","0b59afa3c3e9d0806e75392a8b1bc3aea708c6bc","104b6c334ca6d9eb3c9e1a59960377a24e4ab1e8"],"title":"Complex-valued Time Series Modeling for Improved Activation Detection in Fmri Studies.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1117"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2018,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of applied statistics","paperAbstract":"The emerging field of cancer radiomics endeavors to characterize intrinsic patterns of tumor phenotypes and surrogate markers of response by transforming medical images into objects that yield quantifiable summary statistics to which regression and machine learning algorithms may be applied for statistical interrogation. Recent literature has identified clinicopathological association based on textural features deriving from gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) which facilitate evaluations of gray-level spatial dependence within a delineated region of interest. GLCM-derived features, however, tend to contribute highly redundant information. Moreover, when reporting selected feature sets, investigators often fail to adjust for multiplicities and commonly fail to convey the predictive power of their findings. This article presents a Bayesian probabilistic modeling framework for the GLCM as a multivariate object as well as describes its application within a cancer detection context based on computed tomography. The methodology, which circumvents processing steps and avoids evaluations of reductive and highly correlated feature sets, uses latent Gaussian Markov random field structure to characterize spatial dependencies among GLCM cells and facilitates classification via predictive probability. Correctly predicting the underlying pathology of 81% of the adrenal lesions in our case study, the proposed method outperformed current practices which achieved a maximum accuracy of only 59%. Simulations and theory are presented to further elucidate this comparison as well as ascertain the utility of applying multivariate Gaussian spatial processes to GLCM objects.","inCitations":["1695d7cf66a3340d1ffbe9034d161de0c4796f70","d621c6e047cb66b3b5c3fb85cf22f91253f01315","f4cc8331aaad3067116297ca579a1d17cf9492c3"],"title":"Spatial Bayesian modeling of GLCM with application to malignant lesion characterization.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2018.1473348"}

The first type incorporates three tests based on first-order statistics: van den Wollenberg's Q(1) test, Glas's R(1) test, and Andersen's LR test. The second type incorporates three tests based on second-order statistics: van den Wollenberg's Q(2) test, Glas's R(2) test, and a non-parametric test proposed by Ponocny. The Type I error rates and the power against the violation of parallel item response curves, unidimensionality and local independence were analysed in relation to sample size and test length. In general, the outcomes indicate a satisfactory performance of all tests, except the Q(2) test which exhibits an inflated Type I error rate. Further, it was found that both types of tests have power against all three types of model violation. A possible explanation is the interdependencies among the assumptions underlying the model.","inCitations":["ab53b1151b3d00b5ac80900b7ff5a5eba7df0556","aff0d4750d27175307fd72d8ac0d3654e0f7569f","a3b5c17a99be30883c488019689ea77d4d8d596b","5b034025fc7848fe23aafacaa429b6561f58c6fe","61670ada3fab6bfc1b45bac61af2a606026f5c25","4f4402d9ccc7f684c13f84e352ee7786d555ccc5","c11349469c57e58aeb41db77279f45cc2ec3591a","bc897e29e6de4348f806ecb8c82246ad06381aec","63465ffe1c9f28fe0cfe686a3bd66496d2ab7693","6872fa37ce77eebaacb839701d0fe37068ddb493","d621eb5af1e647338a05d00179cbc87d97125c60","d616537d0ea15538d8509838b0f17a69a392480f","8d170ee1242116b4f51cf3fb712e2394ecd5de0a","ee9c38812f2fa22ffb4ddb04ab8d2eeadce01c1d","08ec114b7bf53093e5509b5b52844c61edab688d","6e8a8bbe1bbd1d17b2d8e11d1a944feceb41c0a1","cca11b788291b5e372b20391143e37c9770e846f","3330c32846283bc61f46bd4fad57167033da8b1f","75411d4e402e9db2ac1451d7fa98ea029af3cceb","4d35cb1280784ef2577b49b0c5f21774b1aeec79","a35a1e4812f1436bf264484853a8d0c1a0244cee","7f3968c4b8d6c92e441abe24219562fb16829f3e","4b6dc0d3bcb68a8de93028a7e89d410b95bf991e"],"title":"Evaluation of global testing procedures for item fit to the Rasch model.","doi":"10.1348/000711003321645395"}

This is usually carried out via exploring the sparsity of the precision matrix of the variables under consideration. Penalized likelihood methods are often used in such explorations. Yet, positive-definiteness constraints of precision matrices make the optimization problem challenging. We introduce non-concave penalties and the adaptive LASSO penalty to attenuate the bias problem in the network estimation. Through the local linear approximation to the non-concave penalty functions, the problem of precision matrix estimation is recast as a sequence of penalized likelihood problems with a weighted L(1) penalty and solved using the efficient algorithm of Friedman et al. (2008). Our estimation schemes are applied to two real datasets.

The targeted maximum likelihood approach involves fluctuating an initial estimate of a relevant factor (Q) of the density of the observed data, in order to make a bias/variance tradeoff targeted towards the parameter of interest. The fluctuation involves estimation of a nuisance parameter portion of the likelihood, g. TMLE has been shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed (CAN) under regularity conditions, when either one of these two factors of the likelihood of the data is correctly specified, and it is semiparametric efficient if both are correctly specified.In this article we provide a template for applying collaborative targeted maximum likelihood estimation (C-TMLE) to the estimation of pathwise differentiable parameters in semi-parametric models. The procedure creates a sequence of candidate targeted maximum likelihood estimators based on an initial estimate for Q coupled with a succession of increasingly non-parametric estimates for g. In a departure from current state of the art nuisance parameter estimation, C-TMLE estimates of g are constructed based on a loss function for the targeted maximum likelihood estimator of the relevant factor Q that uses the nuisance parameter to carry out the fluctuation, instead of a loss function for the nuisance parameter itself. Likelihood-based cross-validation is used to select the best estimator among all candidate TMLE estimators of Q0 in this sequence. A penalized-likelihood loss function for Q is suggested when the parameter of interest is borderline-identifiable.We present theoretical results for \"collaborative double robustness,\" demonstrating that the collaborative targeted maximum likelihood estimator is CAN even when Q and g are both mis-specified, providing that g solves a specified score equation implied by the difference between the Q and the true Q0. This marks an improvement over the current definition of double robustness in the estimating equation literature.We also establish an asymptotic linearity theorem for the C-DR-TMLE of the target parameter, showing that the C-DR-TMLE is more adaptive to the truth, and, as a consequence, can even be super efficient if the first stage density estimator does an excellent job itself with respect to the target parameter.This research provides a template for targeted efficient and robust loss-based learning of a particular target feature of the probability distribution of the data within large (infinite dimensional) semi-parametric models, while still providing statistical inference in terms of confidence intervals and p-values. This research also breaks with a taboo (e.g., in the propensity score literature in the field of causal inference) on using the relevant part of likelihood to fine-tune the fitting of the nuisance parameter/censoring mechanism/treatment mechanism.","inCitations":["6ce72fcbe684ed330c52995a9614fa1434b3be87","d93abae06579cb23a40f2789e41a3bacf5a5474b","9f3922b6e70ad71b8c55985402840ae9ee911f76","b86e9a99708b030ce3bb1329dbc65e8770bdc0a1","2080739951f318ff31a6253ff9de61e64ce7d888","1baf0ad74d5816659db5819e4b6ebfd48052b5a6","28d071846667ff6a7cedc003666903874498cdfc","18205fb6d7d49e0f96b78debb396315001c33a2f","ef4c7472cc62426462b4bf938d1ade706f6582fb","cb35460fc398e10952e110b35f57704c1a4c7635","4150135622a51559c53e6e34c32ccbfa6571fe70","c6116556951b701b78e957aba23292d9c9efe562","eddc2deb1dc88b61137df2877ec6970d669a8997","b6d77285743714db09463240543560025c6ff301","fd7d092f01bed73e8dd5fe100efee243e0cc18e8","f8cf8f35d47f078fb2cd9ee179bcd68eae08ddc6","5f561f92ceffeff37b1782a22a19ee86ba597ce9","237091fafea40e814c379b169d05b510b3b389bd","ed9e2083c5b1baab5a26c25a6526d2b4a8b77b59","fc41ac21596f8d2da1214f9c0fca9f4942639340","b87e4abe9ed5f6aca7e7f8e078fb4344642e7708","65056b43ea4413935148ae06ff8d8736dfdbb49d","9a7bc66aefd0cf953b1e89734ee3a65ed0b291b4","cba55a9e0a5679e064523097d634ed54c255432e","2a1e401a7f74da727ef4c9fbdc6e1dddfd110a28","2f36009d7872d990af1cef333655bf028d0d9e77","aa2fc8b0d21603d27925b465a141d685762fb05c","b32f130cfe4e0daf5a6be97cac57cec14427b8f2","f4fb549e14f58690073d76359798e21eee92bdef","f410a02773766057e8981eff5719f07dac7e74b9","8ba1234c0c067d816d546aca66c6af4903c44451","0f719c8a507b6785a1c12db260c41bf914963883","02dcd52884ebf9a871068ca95819c8b19207e21d","42e4451cf75ee3f2da952538cba07f9e181d633f","2172fd75b7e6e8db47d8f709ceda45c60029363a","add3d74e2d21b4a2ea849af90d7821cfff3516dd","371e53ed0c775d757b0552367c36f0d1c1a96755","3637d4bf1d6af1bd9dbc46bc2b78db2eaaf3a260","8bbb10d7a3f88d3a1bb2e9b652fd689bf580fa22","f45ed765452dfca515a403b1eeb9ebc7087dd416","552c3caa1f9a093f1ace36923fdb10e999a02b61","87b5a813a1dee7b74d799360ed327d633c4d58eb","2ff842214ac58a2dfd3a040c9b95cd9b42963d85","5ff53b360307c85d37aee4f8f7445f8472d2e46c","b2110e41af2f1a9571bbc9817a136e7706ab9290","8a07f471a6d291eeb2f5106373d30f995d54cedf","a39cd2f881a71b887bf821233290647c58876dd5","6ab5ac55f01f2aca776ead3f1657623f53b4294f","7d416d8b6201af8c06e05aa74f7a4ea5f4cdba83","5bda20c2b9257d3b295d19fa1b9ba8cf47989d5d","a1d92aaa26dfee50f301abe32fa3834f33429b18","2beef38f5a3b7a2fd52e64d2b5a7f7cebc5479b4","5c8f568080e1f7a1f0b7c7844c9c0fe2f664d4f3","fba6430dbf9559f26b1a996b71902f22ff2c93c0","618e232c5d120cdbfc703ae3a88049e8fc320243","e3f6fa68dbd915e1dd3dc293f07dc1ba6d356b50","b17273bfc7242acb5469de6c9486e332db2c7b45","9f584a7e21a26004195592aac981fe1ee06573ae","964358fd6537b20738b3eda328241a036483b49a","b4d7ecac98fb93e2f869f1ce3bfb091aaaf05257","a5461ffb5bd1b875ed5a1c78c3102a38bd8cda76","280add6c9deac04885d24580b0f67b2158e8f660","1dc23732b894045439682a4cdf29e585c2eab7a8","a8d96725525660c33256814faad47fe06611b2f1","8c9232db5ff3635cbfccb4c3b7099d52aa3f2f27","9899c7275621c0ae4f56e46e31d231707ee22a49","95da27d0ca857bf549031c97ea6ce38e17c0df5b","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c","2fe427b561855c9edc19be263fea0614446bc085","bd580bb56b1a70595a36f6bc5db6cf8195b15975","ec7ae36f5ce277d211928677d58e5a13805685e8","e3bc464aaf1b6ea3afeef2e295e63e4230bf4251","258660d1ced74cb51f83acef3ce77b706fca8f5c","04ffa716c223b03a42ebd270faf95630e5af6c27","54b883661d1b9da970bbc542c2a26249505eef5c","d237d0b857fc17692f3e970460e1103415126ddf","8ad8ab753cb33fbc6b53e4644a87b9a2c712069a","76e6ca67cf6b44c2ab939999750e0f843955283f","3583f2a253dd7b910c265da34eaddaf00d38dbfe","d8c6d8016d9b0d53262d131d540a1629e316545a","8933ca1e36478b5ddc2ef37fa8d33583f0784f2e","f51e48b59c60ef9ce4ea722a95b260488667dbfe","54644cfabe22b0cc172dfa22602f079774c84d1f","c9407c07efcb0e6073cff47aa50945b1a197033a","b669a6fff30ea7be5909e90f33a3767687150486","48ec49beabed2886d65434448f614d9e0f22d488","e6967dfdf2c3fb5c9a3d053427038a89105585ca","3d6a508f65f5e30ea242efb3c212f44b2184bac3","5e941c25d03ef71a50679b3f7d1ab044023ed59d","4abf38843acd1b8ec53747c15b7b6490e5d69ecc","bd76c09700de4b2c46e5ca8c4631c0cea571d2fe","5c4dfd1b4bf27299f050b94e868882c49315bbbd","1283b5bfb593a3c3ae07d96007bb0417d5c64b12","c4124d5ecf587667eed5cae7908dc36f8383158f","e5055b71cf3b139c0bdb8af53746e378a5a24270","21831fb63fb237bf38fbc8e7e8ef04f80c7ba135","4d76a996ae6d8372e3ca6ef947ba72930e11eff3","91939331adcd898603ca321060a67caf62d4d48b","5190fdd5cd9163316084838cbcd8916facb617b3","3ea7389157feed8b5b8a5aa335817c21b67b1f62","20aab273c8943074f0314a47c873dd3bdcadfbd4","31c3d8fd4e71ec71b7503a55bfe063fcb9484010","6f9474fa6853e8beefc64085077bac737b7800b9","d901577cf2b93f5964999ac014ce1111f2854577","4ff698c36a414594b32ee35ff150daa4d6a2e47c","2710e31741d4213a68215d928ae41089c29fb5e7","050bd7b1b357bedb987a72481c447a7a27b97846"],"title":"Collaborative Double Robust Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1181"}

The fitting approach described by Ramsay and Silverman in the 1990s amounts to a penalized ordinary least squares (P-OLS) estimator of the coefficient functions. We recast this estimator as a generalized ridge regression estimator, and present a penalized generalized least squares (P-GLS) alternative. We describe algorithms by which both estimators can be implemented, with automatic selection of optimal smoothing parameters, in a more computationally efficient manner than has heretofore been available. We discuss pointwise confidence intervals for the coefficient functions, simultaneous inference by permutation tests, and model selection, including a novel notion of pointwise model selection.

In clinical settings, multiple birth-death processes can describe disease trajectories of individual patients, allowing for estimation of the effects of individual covariates on the birth and death rates of the process. Such estimation is usually accomplished by analyzing patient data collected at unevenly spaced time points, referred to as panel data in the biostatistics literature. Fitting linear BDI processes to panel data is a nontrivial optimization problem because birth and death rates can be functions of many parameters related to the covariates of interest. We propose a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for fitting linear BDI models with covariates to panel data. We derive a closed-form expression for the joint generating function of some of the BDI process statistics and use this generating function to reduce the E-step of the EM algorithm, as well as calculation of the Fisher information, to one-dimensional integration. This analytical technique yields a computationally efficient and robust optimization algorithm that we implemented in an open-source R package. We apply our method to DNA fingerprinting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, to study intrapatient time evolution of IS6110 copy number, a genetic marker frequently used during estimation of epidemiological clusters of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Our analysis reveals previously undocumented differences in IS6110 birth-death rates among three major lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has important implications for epidemiologists that use IS6110 for DNA fingerprinting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","inCitations":["763f0b68b18805acd79287da7e3287ad5108e19a","3901ac3c020e3fb2d228d1b0f8e5d5d338778e40","7ddfa97c0c4112751d48909a15034473b46fab1f","428f6322f81a53d334d46d4a3ac11e780056c2ba","052c6925689debd840031bf36702baddae659e0e","5810b9e41214185ee022912fdc3f6be3845963fa","275c2b28e1da1040b88a3a35ae004ff5f5e0c808","d08dcb575928afbafbe1e1d88430b95ce70e49cf"],"title":"Fitting Birth-Death Processes to Panel Data with Applications to Bacterial DNA Fingerprinting.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS673"}

Under different assumptions, different statistical methods have to be developed accordingly; however, in reality this kind of assumption is usually unverifiable. Therefore a less stringent, and hence more flexible, assumption is preferred. In this paper, we consider a generally applicable missing data mechanism, which includes various instances in all three scenarios: missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. Under this general missing data mechanism, we introduce the conditional likelihood and its approximate version as the base for estimating the unknown parameter of interest. Since this approximate conditional likelihood uses the completely observed samples only, it may result in large estimation bias, which could deteriorate the statistical inference and also jeopardize other statistical procedure. To tackle this problem, we propose to use some resampling techniques to reduce the estimation bias. We consider both the Jackknife and the Bootstrap in our paper. We compare their asymptotic biases through a higher order expansion up to O(n -1). We also derive some results for the mean squared error in terms of estimation accuracy. We conduct comprehensive simulation studies under different situations to illustrate our proposed method. We also apply our method to a prostate cancer data analysis.","inCitations":["f3ffa09bcb742d3ba95902fc94e7955171cf770c","766c83c7d6ec150683d88b72d4b65eb8344c050d"],"title":"Reducing Bias for Maximum Approximate Conditional Likelihood Estimator with General Missing Data Mechanism.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2017.1339306"}

The majority of IV analyses of time‐to‐event endpoints are, however, dominated by heuristic approaches. More rigorous proposals have either sidestepped the Cox model, or considered it within a restrictive context with dichotomous exposure and instrument, amongst other limitations. The aim of this article is to reconsider IV estimation under a structural Cox model, allowing for arbitrary exposure and instruments. We propose a novel class of estimators and derive their asymptotic properties. The methodology is illustrated using two real data applications, and using simulated data.","inCitations":["8e3ccbcf5a660362ae3849aa2e242bab5bfb8d06","2e46398e0282044dda5c11414f13309114f1726e","0e367bffff2d19a611082e0ec74bb48f58076233","5360d08cd67d3a1edf39211b60d8f4058cb8b23b","b6ce3c0a2c3bca3390c0c3af08d530e815f2acff","84b36fafb514588c87aca3a3eac70f155ae26b81","81d146739bfa77abbdf2c23b9bf4887e1fe28009","f4a1e91e36e7f7a66ff088b666180c0629ffe963"],"title":"Instrumental variables estimation under a structural Cox model","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx057"}
