Effective use of PCA in modern applications requires understanding its performance for data that are both high-dimensional and heteroscedastic. This paper analyzes the statistical performance of PCA in this setting, i.e., for high-dimensional data drawn from a low-dimensional subspace and degraded by heteroscedastic noise. We provide simplified expressions for the asymptotic PCA recovery of the underlying subspace, subspace amplitudes and subspace coefficients; the expressions enable both easy and efficient calculation and reasoning about the performance of PCA. We exploit the structure of these expressions to show that, for a fixed average noise variance, the asymptotic recovery of PCA for heteroscedastic data is always worse than that for homoscedastic data (i.e., for noise variances that are equal across samples). Hence, while average noise variance is often a practically convenient measure for the overall quality of data, it gives an overly optimistic estimate of the performance of PCA for heteroscedastic data.","inCitations":["a1374e81982fafe6fa2f2af5afd8c826e8b8020a","f6cf908c590f3ed870baf6e89ae0676613062be6","3bba864c81aff7d3ea10de1ee321ad885ed4cf62","5e5cafea5b7893daf784df643ff437ad9f4ca33b","f8118f1917615ac31f77fa33a0ae5f606d35f110","1a45857a1f0667baf071081abe2360a1eb47aea1","de5f8467c7ce266ad255a7c2b05670dba1112598","d93b3b5ed11305a339730bc4f9e069dd45de8e36","42b76824dfbb51f4852a3ffb67caaf2ba6f500d7","54d97f1bf2357eebb7c941ecb3bc06a6cfd58957","761d6f9e66da364e15e5bb59f78320775adc1107"],"title":"Asymptotic performance of PCA for high-dimensional heteroscedastic data","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2018.06.002"}

Edwards (1999) proposes a model selection approach where the model is chosen on the final data set, which remains blinded for treatment group allocation. We investigate this method for time-to-event endpoints and compare its performance to variable selection within an adaptive design. This adaptive design integrates the methods of Schäfer and Müller (2001) and Keiding et al. (1987) and allows variable selection on the unblinded data during an interim analysis. Monte Carlo simulation shows that Edwards' method-though blinded-outperforms the adaptive method in terms of ability to select the survival relevant covariates and power. The application of the methods is illustrated by a clinical trial example.","inCitations":["821ef72d086b9a423c3cc4c83f71035ee9ecec74"],"title":"Blinded versus unblinded covariate selection in confirmatory survival trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.860158"}

Particularly, we are interested in studying the influence of DNA copy number alterations on RNA transcript levels. For this purpose, we model the dependence of the RNA expression levels on DNA copy numbers through multivariate linear regressions and utilize proper regularization to deal with the high dimensionality as well as to incorporate desired network structures. Criteria for selecting the tuning parameters are also discussed. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated through extensive simulation studies. Finally, remMap is applied to a breast cancer study, in which genome wide RNA transcript levels and DNA copy numbers were measured for 172 tumor samples. We identify a trans-hub region in cytoband 17q12-q21, whose amplification influences the RNA expression levels of more than 30 unlinked genes.

We work through an example applying targeted maximum likelihood methodology to estimate the parameter of a marginal structural model. In the case we consider, we show how this can be easily done by clever use of standard statistical software.

Globally useful markers could, however, have ranges of values that are \"diagnostically non-informative\". This paper demonstrates that the presence of marker values from diagnostically non-informative ranges could lead to a loss in statistical efficiency during nonparametric evaluation and shows that grouping non-informative values provides a natural resolution to this problem. These points are theoretically proven and an extensive simulation study is conducted to illustrate the possible benefits of using grouped marker values in a number of practically reasonable scenarios. The results contradict the common conjecture regarding the detrimental effect of grouped marker values during performance assessments. Specifically, contrary to the common assumption that grouped marker values lead to bias, grouping non-informative values does not introduce bias and could substantially reduce sampling variability. The proven concept that grouped marker values could be statistically beneficial without detrimental consequences implies that in practice, tied values do not always require resolution whereas the use of continuous diagnostic results without addressing diagnostically non-informative ranges could be statistically detrimental. Based on these findings, more efficient methods for evaluating diagnostic markers could be developed.","inCitations":["d64b47126adf0a781f677ba82cd828247c3a038b","048db054dc17218d88e15d760e85db498f174da1"],"title":"Informativeness of diagnostic marker values and the impact of data grouping","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2017.07.008"}

The maximum sample size does not have to be specified in advance and one efficacy interim analysis is conducted for the purpose of possible early termination after the first block of data is observed. At the interim analysis for efficacy, the usual sufficient test statistic is used and the type I error rate is adjusted to maintain the overall nominal level. At the final analysis, the test is constructed from a weighted average of the blockwise test statistics based on the sequentially collected data. The weight function at each stage is determined by the observed data prior to that stage. The futility stopping rule allows the trial to be terminated when there is no beneficial treatment effect.

For small sample sizes, the central limit theorem may give a poor approximation, resulting in confidence intervals that are misleading. We discuss this issue and propose methods for constructing confidence intervals for the population mean tailored to small sample sizes.We present a simple approach for constructing confidence intervals for the population mean based on tail bounds for the sample mean that are correct for all sample sizes. Bernstein's inequality provides one such tail bound. The resulting confidence intervals have guaranteed coverage probability under much weaker assumptions than are required for standard methods. A drawback of this approach, as we show, is that these confidence intervals are often quite wide. In response to this, we present a method for constructing much narrower confidence intervals, which are better suited for practical applications, and that are still more robust than confidence intervals based on standard methods, when dealing with small sample sizes. We show how to extend our approaches to much more general estimation problems than estimating the sample mean. We describe how these methods can be used to obtain more reliable confidence intervals in survey sampling. As a concrete example, we construct confidence intervals using our methods for the number of violent deaths between March 2003 and July 2006 in Iraq, based on data from the study ``Mortality after the 2003 invasion of Iraq: A cross sectional cluster sample survey,'' by Burnham et al.

We propose an adaptive error spending approach that further expands practical applications to settings where the interim information levels can depend on blinded accumulating data. We use a simple weighting method to combine independent test statistics from different stages, which are then compared with adaptive boundary values for the group sequential test. We develop a measure-theoretic framework and show that the adaptive error spending approach controls the type 1 error rates. Methods for point estimates and confidence intervals are also proposed. We warn that an error spending approach can lead to serious inflation of the type 1 error rates when the number or timing of interim analyses is allowed to depend on unblinded accumulating data.","inCitations":["66866bc938c28352983b8815a56dad2030cd844e"],"title":"On adaptive error spending approach for group sequential trials with random information levels.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.678232"}

The technique, which does not require normality for the underlying factors, was originally introduced in a very general form by Wall and Amemiya (2000) for any polynomial structural model. In this paper, the practical implementation of this method, including standard error estimation, is presented specifically for the cross-product model. The procedure is applied to an example from social/behavioural epidemiology where the flexibility of the cross-product model provides a useful description of the underlying theory. A simulation study is also presented comparing the method of moments for the cross-product model with three other procedures.","inCitations":["2f6bf4fc546ecc03389a09e294d652cb4632c07e","75ebda75555166574fb8929f5d1c5510c38bbd75","67038545ee658d850fcd8fd10d44e3c602f0b3cf","65f9b1bdc9070dcf49e1165b6f5e395d8960c06d","6d09584c95ed3eb895d38a989a6a3f0f71b4ced6","47af2a03d4dabaccc8700042c6ba40070afb6681","d2d89b578f1b34a26fe5f56aa6f2e98ffb0de1ee","a3508a3296f892e19c07979535e2083b08081be6","05c784a3cccbee5d6d203beabc7154626dd56ecb","7484983260e48f443f1072bf922ecdb64995fcca","276cf1a9e8f64044308310a176be94d662b1238f","d2c78dfe15c354a2fe9b8f7f9b65384c94ef46c5","2924cd7992e0dcc61332d1972263576f05015d4e","db8dc636296b9a6caeb4a5b52f192a2cb4aae1fc","590fda1c7f216a110d4c11fff2d61eee2f451462","be311ca6efdf00c8003b66d0f73dac4bce23fef4","36824f1289237b4c400ef87881de52419a2a3747","ac137837d9ff5a9cf6ec9e921822e23b1bd7d153"],"title":"A method of moments technique for fitting interaction effects in structural equation models.","doi":"10.1348/000711003321645331"}

Evaluation of various statistical techniques that have been developed for mixed data in simulated environments necessarily requires joint generation of multiple variables. This article is concerned with building a unified framework for simulating multiple binary and normal variables simultaneously given marginal characteristics and association structure via combining well-established results from the random number generation literature. We illustrate the proposed approach in two simulation settings where we use artificial data as well as real depression score data from psychiatric research, demonstrating a very close resemblance between the specified and empirically computed statistical quantities of interest through descriptive and model-based tools.","inCitations":["19a06d4906bdf90a67d1ba0434b7e389494d3882","8de594ea35d2d7fb68f1de59c53580f189edc59b","6f8e00954f9d8125440b921170a579d15ec7186b","a6098b315cd11163f3d68ac701bacde7d449bdf9","8de067ee2ae8fe851a17f44864a6610810690e62","dfa0e8e0f76562611258fd34db23df3d62ed6da6","e6f2fde6532958dd18fc398023d15ffc9b1b5e7c","e2c0ecd508c88c33146f6c2d95d43bf887fb8985","362d357173e086c5fd45df642d0cd000a3303b4f","01cab57133c4fa04ae6d65e073199f1d843e47a5","278cfedd1f3277a1ad6a6321400ceb712ca28d9a","c5e89e15c69e0f325e9eb4ca5cc08b5d9633e21d","abab6dd78e74e318e14ca97d6a6fb00cfc182d49","eb78bb2abebd4e673826f9e673b33a41f0a22785","abcf32f97be8b66ba16e6eefeeac152cbbfe9654","aec1154fbb613e5d99ce85089f18ef4e07392866"],"title":"Simultaneous generation of binary and normal data with specified marginal and association structures.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.521874"}
