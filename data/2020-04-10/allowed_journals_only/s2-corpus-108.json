The scientist would like to control the overall error rate in order to draw statistically-valid conclusions from each experiment, while being as efficient as possible. The between-stream data may differ in distribution and dimension but also may be highly correlated, even duplicated exactly in some cases. Treating each experiment as a hypothesis test and adopting the familywise error rate (FWER) metric, we give a procedure that sequentially tests each hypothesis while controlling both the type I and II FWERs regardless of the between-stream correlation, and only requires arbitrary sequential test statistics that control the error rates for a given stream in isolation. The proposed procedure, which we call the sequential Holm procedure because of its inspiration from Holm's (1979) seminal fixed-sample procedure, shows simultaneous savings in expected sample size and less conservative error control relative to fixed sample, sequential Bonferroni, and other recently proposed sequential procedures in a simulation study.","inCitations":["2522515d41aa2000e19487e26afe270fd090f4e1","69d9302a4e7dbc0efb67b1a71569130f0a49f155","17596b9dbc74e5ace3f53a0f9f16a91e953e7834","e99ce4cab6c0ab24623944ae0889f6e91b9c6f4d","a386b31ebe5b21f109d64f321e73951998560203","5f98fb2d92d85954a017c5756810b2f5b37c46aa","9f444a31272447f1ab915ccd0c11dea416c71494","bd7d4f35780d983dff458826f85d15c9abcae17d","5c092a5691e24c6422cd40e0653b757c53cc15f9","4f148f36e676c9668138a8fab751cce53953c44c","5cef7e7e0675a17c65e54b55cba251df721afc51","b255adb8dc1b25a8a4ec9dcd419ce8d2ca061ae4","3ef2f059f8fde640d7a7ed83804cfd3ef5ef3a27","a8ed01c4cc6cfd4cc1cf17fc6849b26f8f33dd13","2a3cd075bd4c0c88117d5d217a8115a7f32cbddd","55cd35301a5b0481b32109afad623658b8b72bbc"],"title":"Sequential Tests of Multiple Hypotheses Controlling Type I and II Familywise Error Rates.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2014.05.010"}

The procedure (termed multi-stage fallback procedure) is an extension of the fallback test proposed by Wiens (2003). The multi-stage fallback procedure features a simple stepwise form and improves the power of dose-control tests at higher doses by taking into account the ordering of the doses. It also serves as an efficient tool for handling multiplicity caused by multiple endpoints. It is shown in this article that the multi-stage fallback procedure can be formulated as a closed testing procedure and thus controls the Type I error rate with respect to multiple dose-control comparisons as well as multiple endpoints. The proposed testing method is illustrated using examples from dose-response clinical trials with single and multiple endpoints.","inCitations":["406fdcafce0485d4ec79073428c7588c0fce0c76","61948481f4dd034d189c913c3a81ef13960d9593","da233d85fa24bea08afaeba3e42d4ee270c01d11","65e7317c8882c9daee8f04b5eda09c8d4ade5ca7","cb3a95c89f5855049d79fa8ccf2da70166df68b8","0a52bb3cd35a8af809318f31ab85c43e1dea3259","90663d88bb11ba0364be4d21d66122775380c5f8","512614cd03f38e47ff84880b1d8122ba52c3cbc2","6d8d5498be525bd7914abe0624569383259f0541","09a77b51af5de428e1a8addda7e046a1ae6fb0a7"],"title":"Fallback tests in dose-response clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600860600"}

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended the proposed equivalence testing approach to sponsors through meeting comments for Pre-Investigational New Drug Applications (PINDs) and Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) since 2014. The FDA has received some feedback on the statistical issues of potentially correlated reference lot values subjected to equivalence testing since independent and identical observations (lot values) from the proposed biosimilar product and the reference product are assumed. In this article, we describe one method for correcting the estimation bias of the reference variability so as to increase the equivalence margin and its modified versions for increasing the equivalence margin and correcting the standard errors in the confidence intervals, assuming that the lot values are correlated under a few known correlation matrices. Our comparisons between these correcting methods and no correction for bias in the reference variability under several assumed correlation structures indicate that all correcting methods would increase the type I error rate dramatically but only improve the power slightly for most of the simulated scenarios. For some particular simulated cases, the type I error rate can be extremely large (e.g., 59%) if the guessed correlation is larger than the assumed correlation. Since the source of a reference drug product lot is unknown in nature, correlation between lots is a design issue. Hence, to obtain independent reference lot values by purchasing the reference lots at a wide time window often is a design remedy for correlated reference lot values.","inCitations":["ab3c9f169e0dbbe937c7290cd4189df1c4b75792","83cc25d3b10e5dcf58556a33e084cfd1632f7a71","00b17200b92771aaa132d2d95165e3e8552e9ba3"],"title":"Statistical considerations regarding correlated lots in analytical biosimilar equivalence test.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1265541"}

The method uses elicited (efficacy, toxicity) probability pairs to construct a family of trade-off contours that are used to quantify the desirability of each dose. This provides a basis for determining a best dose for each cohort. The method combines the goals of conventional Phase I and Phase II trials, and thus may be called a \"Phase I-II\" design. We first give a general review of the probability model and dose-finding algorithm. We next describe an application to a trial of a biologic agent for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, including a computer simulation study to assess the design's average behavior. To illustrate how the method may work in practice, we present a cohort-by-cohort example of a particular trial. We close with a discussion of some practical issues that may arise during implementation.","inCitations":["a3b0130bc6f80f060faacfa74be2179ed84d5be6","8be1159fce3a695b1f5bd83ff13a5845261b1ce9","927d48b50432460aa7304b72d131f4991aa5d785","fc45b2aa79d45d1291f52a420c1d6ad9509fa2bf","c50833f2a763f0ea20299f853e36e1247bb30b26","647d46a7a2eebffefe69948c8ee7498376131ba2","ccecf9ae04ead82024582952bb09c83fd3cbd5f8","d1e80c02b37b20681a536019a1a9c72ab2006d79","dd483a32dfc45b7b0537e694aad2bfba71ddfa7d","5b2ea87e47fc20818673b3e455bf81b1fff597e5","ac3678903347eb6f32176f839b756fab80d5ca47","62ce2c02ef917fbc7e5b9c950d40d99365e969e5","cc46bbe27de3f23f4d8c44da216f20afde13fa14","6846ad069f4c5033d6648b6a11cc0e300b5b575e","3e5e5554219507bf6126e0d8710e36b29fe5aaa0","4c3140230ca4d025941f4c02f8c62117dd2c81aa","96e4f5aa6a7008d2a0b06269a7fc34fd644b78fb","1eab21c8dfccd04d53dcd1bb9753410a05ea2307","d0bb3954b1034510c9069ac0af7cc5202c7e3ff9","6fbbd94f127b6a316afa2e43442dce64b02f9448","0b8857c7cf9530aa92dd135a26ef67991d041d01","c9348e105ebef54237e4a2752891be9af7c69c4f","149f3d8dabccf0c5b9f52958c56d1aace25e5dcf","0f8c6e826de02061eddaf93d7fb85a3462e7da7f","0b7edb6746e955d0eaee41849ea0decfb39fbc0c","f936e9a509c3462eeca3d2eb2af3f982ae874044","08225bd9fad0855bcad1eec69bf3e2b1903cb379","e52b774d3cb7ffcb5dbbb7d8fd12e4a5e0724092"],"title":"Adaptive dose selection using efficacy-toxicity trade-offs: illustrations and practical considerations.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600860394"}

They also strive to release data that are informative for a wide range of secondary analyses. Achieving both objectives is particularly challenging when data stewards seek to release highly resolved geographical information. We present an approach for protecting the confidentiality of data with geographic identifiers based on multiple imputation. The basic idea is to convert geography to latitude and longitude, estimate a bivariate response model conditional on attributes, and simulate new latitude and longitude values from these models. We illustrate the proposed methods using data describing causes of death in Durham, North Carolina. In the context of the application, we present a straightforward tool for generating simulated geographies and attributes based on regression trees, and we present methods for assessing disclosure risks with such simulated data.","inCitations":["e6bba3686836e4ddaeb7a5110322fd891925552f","08fa449501ff8daba5833ca8cce5fa1183ef9a27","f92ef78e3b50c5b27ce2d921b9a0a95f6eb832a2","dcde8147e4d42aa1b1d5974df18e13846332e696","f5978edac55dbde01f793e9416bf405d7691fc88","d52600fbaab7697779e5aed27a77ab2d46df90f2","f1d6edd0831db006bc71d52e50b0ad8d7785ada9","acb8252acb33084383c9c86d2f9c53b413cbcef0","d56587af35d6db73ce58498e7709ed3b428f8fcc","e2cd449cbcc9df2a10c3265080982ff7712f36cd","f26b6430019036e7be527f38c8dc780b72c577b9","784bd3e3c4e4eb18c64bd297fddddd24fc57eda2","aef152aa0320536381eea61dbe2f5b7e83089a60","cd0a75fe5068ba2324838f55554cb4453c82a3a7","59f22e0397e0567abc654812feb62166e29d9bf6","f9267b948dc4dbcd4d87f160b48b8d8dbefce114","b5150ab5fd6c63880e84487a04131caaa3a3e67f","fc005e841c1c80292d0623df3377cc1c5033a627","04bfc10d4197b4f7c4aa2e0b1075dc5bb88e2c11","0c588ad3a26ae9f556b8b7637a157524fbd1a801","6253964446f7f449cc5b65624f4e48a79041057e","cd6780ea54302819c42c4992814dbacedadb8b5d","932d76823532448ebc4f5751584887448d6d8cb4","38690abc15aeff3e9709d2fc5ded208b89ed13be","c0fa99fd3cd2aa5f9594a9462aa044181af34b6f","13551365d73be449e4f19e1104b4e3e9a2a20441"],"title":"Multiple Imputation for Sharing Precise Geographies in Public Use Data.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS506"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2015,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of statistical computation and simulation","paperAbstract":"The statistical methods for variable selection and prediction could be challenging when missing covariates exist. Although multiple imputation (MI) is a universally accepted technique for solving missing data problem, how to combine the MI results for variable selection is not quite clear, because different imputations may result in different selections. The widely applied variable selection methods include the sparse partial least-squares (SPLS) method and the penalized least-squares method, e.g. the elastic net (ENet) method. In this paper, we propose an MI-based weighted elastic net (MI-WENet) method that is based on stacked MI data and a weighting scheme for each observation in the stacked data set. In the MI-WENet method, MI accounts for sampling and imputation uncertainty for missing values, and the weight accounts for the observed information. Extensive numerical simulations are carried out to compare the proposed MI-WENet method with the other competing alternatives, such as the SPLS and ENet. In addition, we applied the MIWENet method to examine the predictor variables for the endothelial function that can be characterized by median effective dose (ED50) and maximum effect (Emax) in an ex-vivo phenylephrine-induced extension and acetylcholine-induced relaxation experiment.","inCitations":["229bc0300c46eb351951de6f6d19f067cd8a1224","de5af160bde798ef39ead3956314043c3ea0b3b3","022591792f718b3f11a645a2e69027f6877e6362","ae2fe1de9c70afcf114f45bed9b4d7061c8088c1","4a209d13d768897a8bbafd5273514cefb4f2d25b","f985eeee9695773ac649dc01b47d5d06f7accc8b","71555f3e9ec20e78247a456a509b2c82fc03b972"],"title":"Variable selection models based on multiple imputation with an application for predicting median effective dose and maximum effect.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2014.907801"}

It is shown how this may be done using an appropriate rotation criterion and a general rotation algorithm.

Volume under the surface and hypervolume under the manifold have been proposed as extensions for multiple class diagnosis (Scurfield, 1996, 1998). However, the lack of simple inferential procedures for such measures has limited their practical utility. Part of the difficulty is that calculating such quantities may not be straightforward, even with a single test. The decision rule used to generate the ROC surface requires class probability assessments, which are not provided by the tests. We develop a method based on estimating the probabilities via some procedure, for example, multinomial logistic regression. Bootstrap inferences are proposed to account for variability in estimating the probabilities and perform well in simulations. The ROC measures are compared to the correct classification rate, which depends heavily on class prevalences. An example of tumor classification with microarray data demonstrates that this property may lead to substantially different analyses. The ROC-based analysis yields notable decreases in model complexity over previous analyses.","inCitations":["2c2fcb5f4f41272e3d15ffcf0bf5446da2297a48","4ae75e28fe8531a1b18ef3d822ba66ff822007a4","62697a8cadfacc687e1305e4f4a7c876f0f5cc0f","d5e4447df722532b4d1daa989fb62a3215c02385","6b7eb453201e6029ce7f0cbbf197c399e1364f2a","9b63a87a7249fb28c7ce21e324f7b380335318cf","2e93fceed906c2d50a5e2fa484c3bd9fed26697c","6c65f7db38e10f2eb43dad1dd42242d5b2d516f9","9b8680789d700cc886f93eaf6ba8e84effd01348","d64b47126adf0a781f677ba82cd828247c3a038b","e3826a860ea2c8ffdd17782e1f097d4ef8ae9f5b","252d4ce84b465f77ce871fc15b8f176b701c4dd7","199a9a29fc2f265a2734fc4505eecbadd0ee4b88","5aea94eba87200d56079fa09f1dc703f48264422","60778a22868b2993d62f4fab64d5e1970398c6cb","c53a2377793b840ed74f3cc83501db268c45e176","d691bc5e9286f2e1d419d738b821686763d1e167","35dca69e49547e9caaa1efaecb83e4436f2ac48b","b9760e050d02f27548f1f850c85b33a29d73f79d","1c7fe803c0879bf8ef79bb9097e3e1b20031ad5e","751413dabfd8a3bbbcca8c17fa82286192e59016","ef726ba1489b67f267b734950a16ff7e299f8f84","891095af430612cdd0d47399a3aa9ca4f9f55ffb","a433f0a6a9ea64f1db04003b0231783aa30ffc60","b397ba95790c643891387c7047f74ba3bf33b979","bcf96e9bc26ac69af8593b7dd0d1e7a478de8c6f","3ee92d70b09419519e94e0e0b85fb0d607dd8a20","28cae5f24a67c5d7f45bf6022302bef60179ff1f","5891df7d01d7bf54aef00d1d8f0118dd19df6a7d","34766c0fcd30e1b358b0ac2d74c73288c41fadba","09993a7cac46851c9c8daff65371b6ac1c88860d","492635b89d364bf2aa8b30bb41b1766904f21fc3","5c8b127da59367b9359cb536a89e93f07cd7ef61","c4131557b1465f9f72de128a84e883a81f3de6c6","1392c1d58714ed2eb646318fa6f13bbf281af9e7","2dc3321b0f9c8cc31014fd8375e83770d6309b36","a0435226403408953d1cb41f46018e5bdc711bf1","3e40345bddc1378afa89eb1739dc4409b6c68e2b","6eeca2ac051694437f146fa700bd41a970496aa7","7439b46a5fd7deaa4c67672fb4740f1e99948c37","2af5dab759879270d4b005d93c915aa12d372026","2700e644fbc6390212d4091087a70790f3851ad4","08be75c471a7e228e6445f92e0c488863eafeab2","3a153049d13cfd8f8bc1f937ac03c143f1457dc1","1cad059faeacfab897431552cee70570f3c35f3d","067ee533bd0b1f269de32e41975fe8b5fc87b298","16bbb30c6b7c149a4b9bfdbfbcd184de620b0cff","a481982d8771461348c901b863fc57aa542fa47e","b386dc49171ddaa5f950130b873809296b5956b3","4b0c772e0870e9c4399f4e5f5d72c13a148731a9","d64f065491192415095a8bc8fab280ca73740c44"],"title":"ROC analysis with multiple classes and multiple tests: methodology and its application in microarray studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm050"}

Relative risks can be estimated directly using log binomial regression but the model may fail to converge. Alternative methods are available for estimating relative risks but these have generally only been evaluated for independent data. As some of these methods are now being applied in cluster RCTs, investigation of their performance in this context is needed. We compare log binomial regression and three alternative methods (expanded logistic regression, log Poisson regression and log normal regression) for estimating relative risks in cluster RCTs. Clustering is taken into account using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with an independence or exchangeable working correlation structure. The results of our large simulation study show that the log binomial GEE generally performs well for clustered data but suffers from convergence problems, as expected. Both the log Poisson GEE and log normal GEE have advantages in certain settings in terms of type I error, bias and coverage. The expanded logistic GEE can perform poorly and is sensitive to the chosen working correlation structure. Conclusions about the effectiveness of treatment often differ depending on the method used, highlighting the need to pre-specify an analysis approach. We recommend pre-specifying that either the log Poisson GEE or log normal GEE will be used in the event that the log binomial GEE fails to converge.","inCitations":["d187713e3c24a09b37fceabc201390f0c5f54a74","ee27e7c35c409165fd858f70bee1344da75ab737","2b8a6b63346ac0915f4ee97c8f5a67d1e8891d45","99d72846648d3c6b66f2ee50a503eab0898b4633","1797a3d36a16f48c105a1512d05a07179e30c3ef"],"title":"Relative Risk Estimation in Cluster Randomized Trials: A Comparison of Generalized Estimating Equation Methods","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1323"}

In classical statistics one can, if appropriate, use likelihood ratio tests and information based criterion, whereas clinical medicine has tended to rely on comparisons of fit metrics like C-statistics. However, for many data adaptive modelling procedures such approaches are not suitable. In these cases, statisticians have used cross-validation, which can make inference challenging. In this paper we propose a general approach that focuses on the “conditional” risk difference (conditional on the model fits being fixed) for the improvement in prediction risk. Specifically, we derive a Wald-type test statistic and associated confidence intervals for cross-validated test sets utilizing the independent validation within cross-validation in conjunction with a test for multiple comparisons. We show that this test maintains proper Type I Error under the null fit, and can be used as a general test of relative fit for any semi-parametric model alternative. We apply the test to a candidate gene study to test for the association of a set of genes in a genetic pathway.","inCitations":["a5c0309b9895066ebd08acfe326b01ce2fdefdd4"],"title":"Testing the Relative Performance of Data Adaptive Prediction Algorithms: A Generalized Test of Conditional Risk Differences","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0014"}

The latter paper has had considerable traction, reportedly being the most downloaded article in the history of PLoS Medicine. Its potential positive impact was more wariness about blithely accepting the results of published studies, better understanding of the factors that lead to misleading research, and more awareness of the domain of meta-research. The potential negative impact of the claim was an unwarranted degree of skepticism, hopefully not cynicism, about truth claims in medical science. So, exploring that hypothesis further using empirical data was much needed. But before commenting on Jager and Leek’s contribution, it is useful to understand the assumptions and methodology that supported the original claim, outlined in detail in 2007 (Goodman and Greenland, 2007). Ioannidis’s argument was based on simple Bayesian mathematics, the same kind used in diagnostic studies. However, two elements were incorporated that had the mathematical effect of nullifying research evidence. First, the information from an experiment used in his model was simply P <0.05, not the exact P-value. Thus, an epidemiologic study generating a main finding with a P <0.0001 was treated in that model identically to one with P =0.04. Quantitatively, for a study with 80% power, this reduced the maximum Bayes factor—the degree to which an experiment raises the prior odds of the alternative hypothesis— from infinity to 16.","inCitations":["b97317ce3bb18d2946f41aed6d424d0b4b10931a","f6e980f2b3c7dbf5c2e0488d22fbf095272fcb5f","479a565b678c78881326bcdb074c24bead02d883"],"title":"Discussion: An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt035"}

In addition, the ways of adjusting for covariables and managing stratification factors are explained.

This paper considers Pareto optimal designs for gene expression studies involving 2-color microarrays. Pareto optimality enables the recommendation of designs that are particularly efficient for the effects of most interest to biologists. This is relevant in the microarray context where analysis is typically carried out separately for those effects. Our approach will allow for effects of interest that correspond to contrasts rather than solely considering parameters of the linear model. We further develop the approach to cater for additional experimental considerations such as contrasts that are of equal scientific interest. This amounts to partitioning all relevant contrasts into subsets of effects that are of equal importance. Based on the partitions, a penalty is employed in order to recommend designs for complex and varied microarray experiments. Finally, we address the issue of gene-specific dye bias. We illustrate using studies of leukemia and breast cancer.","inCitations":["26b5d74816e7755c9ab7b0b69cee636d2ba4d1bc","b9ed3e31f5f13bb9a09099fae592ff07894c81f2","0d834b63f59a39b15cb30c6505537391730893c5","62597fdef42f25f7e977b379cb8653561e7aaabf","60c35f4d0410c317977e1106ea8017ebbed30206"],"title":"Optimal designs for 2-color microarray experiments.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp012"}

This paper presents a novel general statistical approach to the region detection problem in long data sequences. The proposed technique is a multi-scale kernel regression in conjunction with statistical multiple testing for region detection while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and maximizing the signal to noise ratio (SNR) via matched filtering. This is achieved by considering a one-dimensional (1D) region detection problem as its equivalent 0D (zero dimensional) peak detection problem. The detection method does not require a priori knowledge of the shape of the non-zero regions. However, if the shape of the non-zero regions is known a priori, e.g. rectangular pulse, the signal regions can also be reconstructed from the detected peaks, seen as their topological point representatives. Simulations show that the method can effectively perform signal detection and reconstruction in the simulated data under high noise conditions, while controlling the FDR of detected regions and their reconstructed length.","inCitations":["1e6cfd374f29ef22ddc86f16f1a2beee585975c4"],"title":"FDR control of detected regions by multiscale matched filtering","doi":"10.1080/03610918.2014.957842"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2016,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"High-dimensional regression has become an increasingly important topic for many research fields. For example, biomedical research generates an increasing amount of data to characterize patients' bio-profiles (e.g. from a genomic high-throughput assay). The increasing complexity in the characterization of patients' bio-profiles is added to the complexity related to the prolonged follow-up of patients with the registration of the occurrence of possible adverse events. This information may offer useful insight into disease dynamics and in identifying subset of patients with worse prognosis and better response to the therapy. Although in the last years the number of contributions for coping with high and ultra-high-dimensional data in standard survival analysis have increased (Witten and Tibshirani, 2010. Survival analysis with high-dimensional covariates. Statistical Methods in Medical Research 19: (1), 29-51), the research regarding competing risks is less developed (Binder and others, 2009. Boosting for high-dimensional time-to-event data with competing risks. Bioinformatics 25: (7), 890-896). The aim of this work is to consider how to do penalized regression in the presence of competing events. The direct binomial regression model of Scheike and others (2008. Predicting cumulative incidence probability by direct binomial regression. Biometrika 95: (1), 205-220) is reformulated in a penalized framework to possibly fit a sparse regression model. The developed approach is easily implementable using existing high-performance software to do penalized regression. Results from simulation studies are presented together with an application to genomic data when the endpoint is progression-free survival. An R function is provided to perform regularized competing risks regression according to the binomial model in the package timereg (Scheike and Martinussen, 2006. Dynamic Regression models for survival data New York: Springer), available through CRAN.","inCitations":["3676f9f633fc0a447e9eb595184019f458b80594","fac19b5e06482f8af555d70c1529ad2004df4c3f"],"title":"Penalized estimation for competing risks regression with applications to high-dimensional covariates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw017"}

As heterogeneous data are very common in practical research in these fields, the analysis of mixture models has received a lot of attention in the literature. An important issue in the analysis of mixture SEMs is the presence of missing data, in particular of data missing with a non-ignorable mechanism. However, only a limited amount of work has been done in analysing mixture SEMs with non-ignorable missing data. The main objective of this paper is to develop a Bayesian approach for analysing mixture SEMs with an unknown number of components and non-ignorable missing data. A simulation study shows that Bayesian estimates obtained by the proposed Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are accurate and the Bayes factor computed via a path sampling procedure is useful for identifying the correct number of components, selecting an appropriate missingness mechanism, and investigating various effects of latent variables in the mixture SEMs. A real data set on a study of job satisfaction is used to demonstrate the methodology.","inCitations":["2449629d85e772733f8f53e1b4b604308a69737c","bfdf9cf976075e43eba10fb15026c4fe07044d89","d1ed9b84ea5e0e8b184607a4c4f242c679027041","27b020178ac395947eefc70e50f1a5f0fbc8ffd1","ee6c0d96339a8dab48be3375bba29cc2655de611"],"title":"Bayesian analysis of mixtures in structural equation models with non-ignorable missing data.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X475187"}

This article surveys the R package pec which provides a set of functions for efficient computation of prediction error curves. The software implements inverse probability of censoring weights to deal with right censored data and several variants of cross-validation to deal with the apparent error problem. In principle, all kinds of prediction models can be assessed, and the package readily supports most traditional regression modeling strategies, like Cox regression or additive hazard regression, as well as state of the art machine learning methods such as random forests, a nonparametric method which provides promising alternatives to traditional strategies in low and high-dimensional settings. We show how the functionality of pec can be extended to yet unsupported prediction models. As an example, we implement support for random forest prediction models based on the R-packages randomSurvivalForest and party.

Many approaches have been proposed for correlated functional data of this type, including smoothing spline methods and other flexible parametric modeling strategies. In many cases, the underlying biological processes involved restrict the curve to follow a particular shape. For example, progesterone levels in healthy women increase during the menstrual cycle to a peak achieved at random location with decreases thereafter. Reproductive epidemiologists are interested in studying the distribution of the peak and the trajectory for women in different groups. Motivated by this application, we propose a simple approach for restricting each woman's mean trajectory to follow an umbrella shape. An unconstrained hierarchical Bayesian model is used to characterize the data, and draws from the posterior distribution obtained using a Gibbs sampler are then mapped to the constrained space. Inferences are based on the resulting quasi-posterior distribution for the peak and individual woman trajectories. The methods are applied to a study comparing progesterone trajectories for conception and nonconception cycles.","inCitations":["d8c55354dffaa6046203467944fabda94af0f4d4","510607cd952e8386bff9c621ca8a06245c55075e","3c73189fb6387fc26e2559365aba8e5206be1c86","7c119fa476ae77c7f58b0e2ba90b7c34f118cd31","16589058a3d8062d2a5284f9a6f52958dcc652bc","9ef9684c58814218d97601d3771f835e488c978f","c69df2edff56dddcf2913202927c68fac944cc5f","03df39fed250154e0600d910af0b311074af70ab","f382263c57a902985828a2b47a239d7000effe78","45605fd114d645a5b5ecc9d69ff90e1c6da7713c","8830fb5b9571b9c56fc5e012b7bcf87f808903be","52cf78fd86597eb3665ecd31f903e2e2aebf91fa","c3a447307e81b59994c9a688867b7de89cc7e08a","70f5bc684936243c428fc3561f5f1c0a0f3b75ad"],"title":"A transformation approach for incorporating monotone or unimodal constraints.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi020"}

Here, we discuss the use of optimal multivariate matching prior to randomization to improve covariate balance for many variables at the same time, presenting an algorithm and a case-study of its performance. The method is useful when all subjects, or large groups of subjects, are randomized at the same time. Optimal matching divides a single group of 2n subjects into n pairs to minimize covariate differences within pairs-the so-called nonbipartite matching problem-then one subject in each pair is picked at random for treatment, the other being assigned to control. Using the baseline covariate data for 132 patients from an actual, unmatched, randomized experiment, we construct 66 pairs matching for 14 covariates. We then create 10000 unmatched and 10000 matched randomized experiments by repeatedly randomizing the 132 patients, and compare the covariate balance with and without matching. By every measure, every one of the 14 covariates was substantially better balanced when randomization was performed within matched pairs. Even after covariance adjustment for chance imbalances in the 14 covariates, matched randomizations provided more accurate estimates than unmatched randomizations, the increase in accuracy being equivalent to, on average, a 7% increase in sample size. In randomization tests of no treatment effect, matched randomizations using the signed rank test had substantially higher power than unmatched randomizations using the rank sum test, even when only 2 of 14 covariates were relevant to a simulated response. Unmatched randomizations experienced rare disasters which were consistently avoided by matched randomizations.","inCitations":["7f600ca8077cf2ea106e5a4981356d3c1e9f1f6e","573cb46796499a3825d45e23647991c37828d6fc","af686c52158e47fcd75da6fe6bad14689cc7fbf0","aeae3def495f180eaa5a67a3ff9973ba538e418e","22263d85d877d40ffe567c391039363d9fd716e2","842a6cf6665a2435d80ec8a44f415462b3ce12c3","679567d494cfc4ac244fd89e31226566de374465","3c99b826b76319e99abfd227846033e78a7cb9bd","a6b9ce815409b2d0af7c4ff40d13d57d564637f0","a273dcfd99f8855181f2c4fe3204b4554bdd0d43","3d7eb46b3f3759b4dddc24ab042f0103f96323d2","ab058dbe8fa54be858eb3f27509bb5876352e9fd","e4a7bb2c1b4ad4aa1513e8420cce730a7ef40a4e","d461e968da8b874be6f2bff258957a60a0926827","c7a984e33e1f3880a5cf2c12b80ee1341ff30f1f","a00907767d33835d6d714bfaf487c06a0a773b20","50bbf7ae5ae58f7072b346a52781b8492bf9de19","a90d53d0015db001c4b676e03550cc65a02ae581","0444a1b897addb972316e9d13cfeef0e94287615","a8d3afd007b1524dc468dbad5154c1a00cdb197f","c72911c02ba36b71662a848fb8e85bb645d012ba","3f1da43f76e1b0153e15c7191e1c94957236081f","1ba70a2fd8fbbab1f5763106c1189950c15114e8","27a1605c134945d8b3dfcb906f54e34aa782cb3c","a4d1443a5b0bc8ccbd2c1db9de0e799201570306","d1425127fee3a3a76ecb00099f67467666fdc80f","cbd1c163ca147a6b645d43a9beaef9e6ab6079b7","993cdd45aabc14b216690d6fb992fa97ff79de0e","0a8c0cd4c2254316da8b1ce619bb7a4dc854a25c","edb9982c997c88f37cf0e8b55e1ef265586874d4","b9775b9883185188c06342a3e78d87758f53fe30","da852932acd143079cbb6b14fa67db6116f6a978","4e9129f2d0ac375e0f5e1c78eb5b6ea3d1c47890","c25b2e3db2c6573486503ec84b18c74f0cb7fbd2","951973182c9a17d860dbfc759e558fc708b40b44","da085533b83ac655205ed4dc750af18941c0dc19","01ffa398affaf12548208ee3ede072f3258bae21","4150135622a51559c53e6e34c32ccbfa6571fe70","099ea7c8297408a3c6d8f79a25bea438bf969023","00169a115e242cd38e7007c64e849ac4d1a4b9e9","bc7027b2ae03b761e062fc283f4d994611d68cce","e75595a9b19bb5834f8c213cb8957e609ce27fb5","f51b4655d03f6dab706b8db7b64cbd9d9e5dc9ef","442f411bf07429f3e2050461fe9d42b7ff5a9d61","0cf36c2aef3475ec6003438bd6ec7474c4331933","c104df9aabcd2e38345cbf5387b1bb4acc38ccc0","9a21e0f1a1159daac272cd8f09184ad44fa6da24","fd45ab3630c469c2eb808b6399fafef9e0cbbf11","0a256819060275b06917d4039bd22f4cb6f920c6","ad6651065cac96f50c720b1462ea2dd52178c602","52f01d81070c6bcc5a837dd6702d4de642d7fc9a","b57f05991e656d7ff06f483ed1d1175496d584b3","71b2bd3808866b2f7aa73a254b5cee4343d94120","947c02d166f302a32797b226ad3a674fb2b124cb","c6d81d9390246ddb339b1efc28a7e9665e28642c","83e61f26d93b5526dfa19bc5b7b41cf442c366c6","e3164e0ee7be1cbc76dc7ed83ca3cb8038961714","02ca3c875e018eca8c9506b1edaeecf9140a4db9","7970fd83beb840ffe21440196e0ec535c303263c","c3029008cb3b66dcf80331aafd8905b7906022e6","b7906f4fe6a17e2cb6aca1abfb27a701818d10ab","683b6e8bd2e950b6a67fee726d3f55f75482cdd6","fb9d95ad9e1d659058ef1ec50c50bfdbdd2b9f6e","b9528ec250744b55dc86ade5330636253447599d","25aa8febd0f2a55d5286ca2a5a424ef089fb4fc6","bad52942864af0c368cd3ba746591ac6b84c0f37","15e72c7afd6b5466953a3c3f26905fc20f8decc9","73354fbef249ab438c819a8ebb87095890123d59","3c29dfe477f54f49a36b832db5ffd56d476a5f32","5cf201410fa87d25c6272976578cbf26ad33eccc","8e298998c804e3ef9dda4f154fc39a39a9f10eec","a17a887e7e0bb2aaddf739528874743faf8e8a34","d76025f93160023ddfcb1efb2feab735d8aa0d1e","abef04e16912c23c8e677594b14c5539083bba33","f6471512884c61114837bb3ffb63a52e5107e0ab","3f00a704a295a8165a502c8a99839b5ed18b401d","5cf7518e6830cc4739965247250fa50472acefba","815d2e3b5250c84505354fd1e06a6fe561f1cf43","f04a4efc27824062dfae2e043fe36c5522da0fb2","15a14d4b7960937ad548b689e869023c07d025aa","f8bfc0aeec4cbc0773fda1c911b2d046faf18522","964bc647930420c9b12717ce63a1162a1e23c0d3","0529a275f63f60bf5d03a244de308144997f7618","29d2b0fb3623a3f599e161677e7c53be6ab6a912","27681b99fb4d76557ed7c854008b408d0e7be19c","75f09fefce77947dd72916a634c6dca6174d4233","612b2cfaaf6e82fe00c10e2b17917d8a0195150d","725a2d0a269dcca8bf26e14e063aaa9d593ab5e9","7968ff79d5ddeb1e1f6f47384cbe8b260e5531ab","886624afeca0223b7a5a76152ab1520d047af378","3f14108de02523787917abe811eaaab408882123","b7d1b5af38ad18e2cb6406052b43c3094122c3ce","3c522f03ea2430a8a37f579db898b2cce36a47a3","81ba8b473fbb0cb9ed0bf60404f832803d99a3b4","ebebb556d9fa034d6dcd020f91904ec306ebaeba","9fef45c932a24b3b4ec9fe4e456bc29ad3d24a8e","893a17c80f99fe67aadc9b42695c90e820b5d839","f3b0a170ca239ab8ddc41e3d2055e269df969d00","ef23fa2eaaacc0946e6bcb643f393864ddda17f6","e314ca0e834bab7901a8be328af99a176be3a195","1c6ca73aa4e91188f397688777067f0380eb3447","f38f4ecd01c604a41f6ced1206b656e855b305b2","f732344300d16040eb47cf2a6cd17bd6e3278a9a","127bc9ea21332a29f5b3ec5b0681485ce3ef96eb"],"title":"Optimal multivariate matching before randomization.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.2.263"}
