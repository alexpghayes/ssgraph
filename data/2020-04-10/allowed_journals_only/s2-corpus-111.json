In their method, a new feature is added into the current selected feature subset if it will bring in the most extra information. This information is measured by using the distance between the new feature vector and the column space spanned by current feature subset. The incremental forward feature selection scheme can exclude highly linear correlated features that provide redundant information and might degrade the efficiency of learning algorithms. The method is compared with the weight score approach and the 1-norm support vector machine on two well-known microarray gene expression data sets, the acute leukemia and colon cancer data sets. These two data sets have a very few observations but huge number of genes. The linear smooth support vector machine was applied to the feature subsets selected by these three schemes respectively and obtained a slightly better classification results in the 1-norm support vector machine and incremental forward feature selection. Finally, the authors claim that the rest of genes still contain some useful information. The previous selected features are iteratively removed from the data sets and the feature selection and classification steps are repeated for four rounds. The results show that there are many distinct feature subsets that can provide enough information for classification tasks in these two microarray gene expression data sets.","inCitations":["5914c8df5432e79ad01331660d29d5a459fa66a1","6187a901fcfaa47ea0415479151714f8e0a1b2f0","a65b3e2c847cb877b9e1d81948e650b4c891770d","bbc30efcaf108a06360cbb6b08be146b3930d10d","4490fbb9877b65add3d0cad7f1fa179ef032df63","cedde88cbc7c2639ab6f7681ed6a869da60738e4","734a959df7afda53314b24b782632bf4888489b4","bfaaad9585698330877cd3dd57a3ff779f07f39d","c8e23b7720433ee2537d93867e3389c0c8690cdf","ca83a938b6533f2f43b0f1a2a21c9213622aab52","477d388add97d988764b6b9141fd9abfe1577349","00f14d32ead4933543a8c3c8630c438eacce04c6"],"title":"Incremental forward feature selection with application to microarray gene expression data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802277868"}

In this paper, we propose robust Wald-type tests for testing such two sample problems using the minimum density power divergence estimators of the underlying parameters. In particular, we consider the simple two-sample hypothesis concerning the full parametric homogeneity as well as the general two-sample (composite) hypotheses involving some nuisance parameters. The asymptotic and theoretical robustness properties of the proposed Wald-type tests have been developed for both the simple and general composite hypotheses. Some particular cases of testing against one-sided alternatives are discussed with specific attention to testing the effectiveness of a treatment in clinical trials. Performances of the proposed tests have also been illustrated numerically through appropriate real data examples.","inCitations":["bda9e96d4f6731a22dec65d8f98d9730573e6021","930b067c03eacf85f1d6fa86c91e5bb2f1dc2e2e"],"title":"A New Class of Robust Two-Sample Wald-Type Tests","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2017-0023"}

In this analysis, a new health response function is based on a model of human response over time to estimate long-term health outcomes from a change point in short-term linear regression. This important estimation capability is addressed for small groups and single-subject designs in pilot studies for clinical trials, medical and therapeutic clinical practice. These estimations are based on a change point given by parameters derived from short-term participant data in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The development of the change point in initial OLS data and the point estimations are given in a new semiparametric ratio estimator (SPRE) model. The new response function is taken as a ratio of two-parameter Weibull distributions times a prior outcome value that steps estimated outcomes forward in time, where the shape and scale parameters are estimated at the change point. The Weibull distributions used in this ratio are derived from a Kelvin model in mechanics taken here to represent human beings. A distinct feature of the SPRE model in this article is that initial treatment response for a small group or a single subject is reflected in long-term response to treatment. This model is applied to weight loss in obesity in a secondary analysis of data from a classic weight loss study, which has been selected due to the dramatic increase in obesity in the United States over the past 20 years. A very small relative error of estimated to test data is shown for obesity treatment with the weight loss medication phentermine or placebo for the test dataset. An application of SPRE in clinical medicine or occupational therapy is to estimate long-term weight loss for a single subject or a small group near the beginning of treatment.","inCitations":["b1722282f04150dc7b77381d5ce9ed0704614fd3","ac5a12386365f9622b0eca2dfe5c068214917dba","b6488de5b5fb3fb7d7dc479d3319588a566cd388","ce1d47fa94508a65e483f8073c71bb59b8362890"],"title":"Novel Point Estimation from a Semiparametric Ratio Estimator (SPRE): Long-Term Health Outcomes from Short-Term Linear Data, with Application to Weight Loss in Obesity","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2012-0049"}

Costs can hamper the evaluation of the effectiveness of new biomarkers. In addition, many assays are affected by a limit of detection (LOD), depending on the instrument sensitivity. Two common strategies used to cut costs include taking a random sample of the available samples and pooling biospecimens. We compare the two sampling strategies when an LOD effect exists. These strategies are compared by examining the efficiency of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, specifically the estimation of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for normally distributed markers. We propose and examine a method to estimate AUC when dealing with data from pooled and unpooled samples where an LOD is in effect. In conclusion, pooling is the most efficient cost-cutting strategy when the LOD affects less than 50% of the data.

It is suggested that the appropriate measure of signal uncertainty is the conditional probability that the signal would be presented given that it has not been presented before. This conditional probability is called the expectancy function. It is assumed that the expectancy function influences the subject's state of readiness and this in turn influences reaction time; and ways of expressing these relations mathematically are discussed. It is shown that, with a suitable representation of subjective errors in time and probability estimation, a theory can be stated which accounts for the qualitative features of a variety of experimental data. \n \nThe relevance of this theory to studies concerned with central intermittency is then discussed. It is argued that temporal uncertainty alone is insufficient to account for the increase in reaction time to the second of two closely spaced signals, both of which require a response. On the other hand, a model for the interaction of two responses is stated in which refractoriness in the central processes is not inevitable.","inCitations":["071fc0ce0b857e2bc9d48e1d521649797aed4693","cda413090225a7057980eb5d38c87b1b1ae8273d","1d1b4cf36ee87bb6abc86ba74962f4e70906a2a7","94a096bd4bbc3a3da44cf322417d97f1bcefbdc1","9eaee04b2c3bfd97fde947b5c9a1eb06f06d8fa5","b24c02f88133e30e48fe08b9c7dd96d615dc985a","8cdd647936e15fd06a4d11eff47365987768289e","ef4bd024199ac36e9c0b8c2d322d38a17602caed","525481e7c3c8ec9aa7ac8858a3cefb88d038960c","c41418731aa2600c2c1b301f5611d02621656ec8","f8fb6e0173ba1c6b493d2cd1d2a632bbb66f84e2","df5edf4b15ee889176fdfc371ad257f3f25751c2","6bc5fa84c454357acbb213d80d915faaf4738635"],"title":"Reaction-time studies: the anticipation and interaction of responses.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1967.tb00375.x"}

In this paper, we propose a unified estimation method for semiparametric accelerated failure time models under general biased estimating schemes. The proposed estimator of the regression covariates is developed upon a bias-offsetting weighting scheme and is proved to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Large sample properties for the estimator are also derived. Using rank-based monotone estimating functions for the regression parameters, we find that the estimating equations can be easily solved via convex optimization. The methods are confirmed through simulations and illustrated by application to real datasets on various sampling schemes including length-bias sampling, the case-cohort design and its variants.","inCitations":["447729f8ab91059cadd8373a992cf50d0412a6b6","508caa105fd95c8edc326ec623f141adcf89f152"],"title":"Accelerated failure time model under general biased sampling scheme.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw008"}

We model the component densities using parametric densities that include data transformation as well as flexible transformed models. In addition, we model the mixing proportion, the probability of a latent variable corresponding to the true unknown infection status, via a logistic regression to incorporate covariates. This model includes mixtures of multivariate normal densities as a special case and is able to accommodate unusual shapes and skewness in the data. We assess model performance in simulations and present results from applying various parameterizations of the model to the Ugandan study.","inCitations":["280b741887a1ccc69df8f73eb7de7a7233e8a9ec","d5aa6cad585486f75abd985281305de9e031e98c","5ee1b785af4bc16514d3dc05d096d2b9925d56df","d676549b45e21701b322ffba031fe8015ba93327","3444c886be65518533ff41332f989333a8e02a23","779c54be63bbd65cb24e84a1a47fe016f1868a8b","512b86ab2efc57820ebc0a86106bf275f47612d7","4dc624b9b73108b4f1a7cac9e5c4d77a8db28af8","e111255d14204a3a3f48a218d3677d5d53720f58","a7623b7fcd0100825a4e3ded1e715cf3fc0d7594","03e098e2a37daff806ff0f98933e967c6a7b3cb8","9f7d0dcf4e0c6527d956ecee7b274f6e86ba3da1"],"title":"Combining assays for estimating prevalence of human herpesvirus 8 infection using multivariate mixture models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm018"}

Data from these controlled experiments, however, may also contain sources of unwanted noise that can distort the signal under study, affect the residuals of applied statistical models, and hamper data analysis. Commonly, normalization methods are applied to transcriptomics data to remove technical artifacts, but these are normally based on general assumptions of transcript distribution and greatly ignore both the characteristics of the experiment under consideration and the coordinative nature of gene expression. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology, ARSyN, for the preprocessing of microarray data that takes into account these 2 last aspects. By combining analysis of variance (ANOVA) modeling of gene expression values and multivariate analysis of estimated effects, the method identifies the nonstructured part of the signal associated to the experimental factors (the noise within the signal) and the structured variation of the ANOVA errors (the signal of the noise). By removing these noise fractions from the original data, we create a filtered data set that is rich in the information of interest and includes only the random noise required for inferential analysis. In this work, we focus on multifactorial time course microarray (MTCM) experiments with 2 factors: one quantitative such as time or dosage and the other qualitative, as tissue, strain, or treatment. However, the method can be used in other situations such as experiments with only one factor or more complex designs with more than 2 factors. The filtered data obtained after applying ARSyN can be further analyzed with the appropriate statistical technique to obtain the biological information required. To evaluate the performance of the filtering strategy, we have applied different statistical approaches for MTCM analysis to several real and simulated data sets, studying also the efficiency of these techniques. By comparing the results obtained with the original and ARSyN filtered data and also with other filtering techniques, we can conclude that the proposed method increases the statistical power to detect biological signals, especially in cases where there are high levels of structural noise.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2005,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"This paper addresses optimal design and efficiency of two-phase (2P) case-control studies in which the first phase uses an error-prone exposure measure, Z, while the second phase measures true, dichotomous exposure, X, in a subset of subjects. Optimal design of a separate second phase, to be added to a preexisting study, is also investigated. Differential misclassification is assumed throughout. Results are also applicable to 2P cohort studies with error-prone and error-free measures of disease status but error-free exposure measures. While software based on the mean score method of Reilly and Pepe (1995, Biometrika 82, 299--314) can find optimal designs given pilot data, the lack of simple formulae makes it difficult to generalize about efficiency compared to one-phase (1P) studies based on X alone. Here, formulae for the optimal ratios of cases to controls and first- to second-phase sizes, and the optimal second-phase stratified sampling fractions, given a fixed budget, are given. The maximum efficiency of 2P designs compared to a 1P design is deduced and is shown to be bounded from above by a function of the sensitivities and specificities of Z. The efficiency of 'balanced' separate second-phase designs (Breslow and Cain, 1988, Biometrika 75, 11--20)-in which equal numbers of subjects are chosen from each first-phase strata-compared to optimal design is deduced, enabling situations where balanced designs are nearly optimal to be identified.","inCitations":["648993b773aefb663e3c980dbb14d971a55eeed4","4c8c1c86c0e83b3434c15a2820a7c45f0b69a725","9954572d10d560b796ad1f5ffc6a1f89c0312fcd","a742e29c78676c6709fec63364a60aa011787634"],"title":"Optimal design and efficiency of two-phase case-control studies with error-prone and error-free exposure measures.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi029"}

Efficient collection of toxicity data in Phase I would eventually improve the accuracy of optimal dose combination identification in Phase II. In this paper, we develop a novel dose-finding method based on efficacy and toxicity outcomes for two-agent combination Phase I/II trials. We propose a \"zone-finding stage\" that determines the most admissible toxicity zone on the dose combination matrix and subsequently select the dose combination allocated to the next patient from that zone in Phase I. Upon completion of this zone-finding stage, we allocate the next patient to the dose combination determined by adaptive randomization of the admissible toxicity and efficacy dose combinations in Phase II. Simulation studies demonstrated the utility of the proposed zone-finding stage and proved that the operating characteristic of the proposed method was no worse than the existing method. The sensitivity of the proposed method, as well as the operating characteristic of this method when the efficacy outcome is delayed, was also examined.","inCitations":["b30357c91d508c3a71062dc16c9ceabefebac183","94df5339fcf7c1f1b97af4470b895af178beb300","752fd586c1a99a838e32c082b2ff561e29b25228"],"title":"Two-stage approach based on zone and dose findings for two-agent combination Phase I/II trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2018.1434190"}

There is compelling evidence of issues with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for shelf life estimation. Issues include fixed batch effects, poolability tests, and confidence intervals for the mean. Two conclusions from evaluating the ICH procedure are that batch effects should be random and that focus should be on a quantile.

A key contribution of our work is that, to maximize the use of all existing biological knowledge, we allow incorporation of multiple gene networks into joint modeling of genomic data by introducing a mixture model based on the use of multiple Markov random fields (MRFs). Another important contribution of our work is to allow different genomic data to be correlated and to examine the validity and effect of the independence assumption as adopted in existing methods. Due to a fully Bayesian approach, inference about model parameters can be carried out based on MCMC samples.

In this article, we conduct multiple imputation for univariate continuous data under the GLD to explore the extent to which this procedure works properly; and we make comparisons with normal imputation models via widely accepted accuracy and precision measures using simulated data that exhibit different distributional features as characterized by competing specifications of the third and fourth moments. Furthermore, we present an application using a clinical trials data from psychiatric research. Multiple imputation under the GLD that cover most of the feasible area in the skewness-elongation plane appears to have substantial potential of capturing real missing-data trends that can be encountered in biopharmaceutical practice.","inCitations":["f3ee38ff1f98c1394212ca3167c88fccdb2c4a23","f6f462e71e6e253575f03ad881a5bfed11ce8084"],"title":"Multiple imputation under the generalized lambda distribution.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802527882"}

This class includes and extends a number of specific models which have been proposed recently, and, in the absence of association, reduces to separate models for the measurements and events based, respectively, on a normal linear model with correlated errors and a semi-parametric proportional hazards or intensity model with frailty. Special cases of the model class are discussed in detail and an estimation procedure which allows the two components to be linked through a latent stochastic process is described.

In this context, the major failure event could be correlated with recurrent events, and the usual assumption of noninformative censoring of the recurrent event process by death, required by most statistical analyses, can be violated. Recently, joint modeling for 2 survival processes has received considerable attention because it makes it possible to study the joint evolution over time of 2 processes and gives unbiased and efficient parameters. The most commonly used estimation procedure in the joint models for survival events is the expectation maximization algorithm. We show how maximum penalized likelihood estimation can be applied to nonparametric estimation of the continuous hazard functions in a general joint frailty model with right censoring and delayed entry. The simulation study demonstrates that this semiparametric approach yields satisfactory results in this complex setting. As an illustration, such an approach is applied to a prospective cohort with recurrent events of follicular lymphomas, jointly modeled with death.","inCitations":["6f17fa9752d9490aafe650ee618941d41c1daa3f","b1395b5dd1ab101136ffeb1412edcbdedda5bf2a","b477fc9e84c4181067ba1373e0ed4abefd7f42ef","de0ea6897c775e4bdb3f906b89a7d9ba5ec1b128","da9fc5a3a7ca1474fa0bee25f88fc46256bdfa08","ee00b25b02a35c489d21df34ced0248e7e3aa711","b90831a77fd5d2089842f346aece798b091904f0","7997cf5bb4914f2465dd095c30ab1a75e3f1dc24","a5eb719e2544d64fb7727f41a4ed793ac0e55a6a","cae6427b05968f986f5b1468d384f0afb29d0d58","c5312204d03a0c259026e213b8742f4d64d25cab","03f851e4712996bbe41a9559b152c69bf1429d20","4a2569758185772205df81cd24ae44e5111dd40c","0c8c5238e602d61421ee49b977dbbb50984447be","7396f71d54d53f2c5add5d3d766f09e63dd4bc5a","1fb50136045b4335dc711cebbb37c97d226b8f3d","7caccab267ae90e2d49dd0fb49823231b451d81f","c6439fb2390d5803d54f7a9e7c27dd1c11abeb23","a138294bebfb961e99dcb110b434f3c5e33a5626","7ce2ec7fd073f38af7de4015b0ba26c074d59377","b0cc673af31d496e364cb0c0972a10d175caea87","b6d33ffa3b4cf06f8e8296b4869525e04a4334d6","59db9209a6d78cdd1e620c8c3ebbedf8f8689852","3452d6722545ad12d0db8ed27bd0b24326d0fb0d","81b7cc0ec6d605dfd61d68f299a7c4bd5c03ab94","2894c01e11aba87eb2f22731f7e7111b5c24edcb","116c9d3647e269d8b8a51c558bc0eb6b7761c440","1c4442e0251ff758a3f0e497a1e416fa85ebaf37","eb8f9803617fe33e2602934423c839b17be4c0df","34ee5ec256f9bbeb27770b2308445784d77f653d","1173c1109be6cffbc97e8f770e35b5326262475b","7d16979dd9ce8e29b0cc679917861ba2dac68bbe","5a8c41344d3163a397a7f4e5c9bc75cdcea330f6","ce9625aa559340f6e8477f95c473096af75a52be","ffa7fabf64f5feb7bf3eef68eae3fd1ed2fb162c","94fa49b5aaf351d5ce586c17d542b06c92510c63","687bdac884877d2d2f45bc1f5e0a543008cc91b8","59a9876b9ebddd1b5f36e6bb5df5217c43802218","23d27aa8e5b68efc78f5235a06eb8089ecdb2d19","53c4a349264b504c4ec87879543fc82c676f0eca","872bf8b44c9e927220b630e70249e60001f2f76c","249c2fdf985bf3a8af8a19db406b7b3ae46ce449","80fd923bc909ed15afe0b3e6312356a6c9e5ac7e","39cf84023f201c4422453ffe84ba507aefe4466a","4d6bb36010825487475f7333a0fa36fa148dee3c","53dea44e3e1f9fa796ea31aa423fc4d61f64e502","56f9c8767934ca379fdd95049980a0ba849ac150","6511f0868ddece84c4d27e9d033962c2d58a2f1f","57a1008fde98d9f4c90b36e6af4dfe554355d746","6d12b0b5d52270d64ff327213ddc09b3c29c5397","1f44fcbc7f3308a6ae6ec4d7d399937c369e82ac","b5f2d27be8193d8e9f95fe894a4d973a3b087dfd","2272e154d2680b78c346c9d39599f9f6f3a100aa","1caec306e6f156684c3d4ff936b20e0c7d438f57","bf31cc3a558c5083a48b6232f897070abdb51089","e49bdc59faac8cd1f4282404b528846cfb2911d9","9ab3a0cf17da911e39aa519e57c2ed13d1a478bf","f2750818950009bab29b0530000f2b82ee587b77","1504183de992fa67e912874fee88d998a77a6204","276799d076daf933cbdd42f31a18946130eaf09a","e7efb314deefac072a3b2413a5c4cf9baee222ba","f0c1ca8d03f2ff15359575a466ebb45d44dc8939","2102235cff8a317cc0cc9c8b37ffe318e3c215bf","ac952e75d0fb01977a55c6b954b81e3ccd5e6acd","8c2430e1a738191f54d4a417edab00a1e884c586","46a6fdffb68bcdad49377601ce3ed30abdd28847","72627846394f415a96578f83d68aab75ca03e9df","5833917d74b49c3f7d4e103df5824d3398f567ec","5b3ce72743a7763cae22198ebc2b42cd683a05da","41b32c48864e406248b5113556dfe2f5dfa0fa8e","2417d48941719a0c8c75549768507e4dad91a251","cb0d8d988b6900e7031d5dcc94badc2a1c1728f7","6d1d091f71932db82143debb015bc4fb353f8821","87eb3dc3a5672988bfde9fac4eeac6cb4e4dc36d","4df7143fb12a29c4c47303c81ee1b13afe70e44a"],"title":"Joint frailty models for recurring events and death using maximum penalized likelihood estimation: application on cancer events.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl043"}
