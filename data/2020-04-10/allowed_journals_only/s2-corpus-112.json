Because the number of parameters increases quadratically in the dimension, it is often useful to consider a sparse parameterization. We introduce a pair of prior distributions on the set of correlation matrices for longitudinal data through the partial autocorrelations (PACs), each of which vary independently over [-1,1]. The first prior shrinks each of the PACs toward zero with increasingly aggressive shrinkage in lag. The second prior (a selection prior) is a mixture of a zero point mass and a continuous component for each PAC, allowing for a sparse representation. The structure implied under our priors is readily interpretable for time-ordered responses because each zero PAC implies a conditional independence relationship in the distribution of the data. Selection priors on the PACs provide a computationally attractive alternative to selection on the elements of R or R-1 for ordered data. These priors allow for data-dependent shrinkage/selection under an intuitive parameterization in an unconstrained setting. The proposed priors are compared to standard methods through a simulation study and a multivariate probit data example. Supplemental materials for this article (appendix, data, and R code) are available online.","inCitations":["09ceb180ac12113855fd6a35408b1141e7bbda1a","dc12ad968187063205767c7071e8c8aca43bd933","77c49090e7df68abf1bae4dab41b9fb933393609","3eca4ce8390dba626537d458b24a90dbabc0ccf7","276106d3667e5d4aa09f438cc3a7f2bad678364e"],"title":"Sparsity Inducing Prior Distributions for Correlation Matrices of Longitudinal Data.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2013.852553"}

First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax exogenous mobility by modeling the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent-type framework. Our results suggest that allowing endogenous mobility increases the variation in earnings explained by individual heterogeneity and reduces the proportion due to employer and match effects. To assess external validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker. The mobility-bias corrected estimates attribute much more of the variation in revenue per worker to variation in match quality and worker quality than the uncorrected estimates.","inCitations":["5f37605d57dac6cf910d463a46bb1b4eaf6ce29a","2b400f77f23e584e1dffa0fba81d294213e5072e","d76f512f7c3f3cbe6845a970122fc5d1c11e7da8","a3456613fe6b77b7358a4119fc73ebc86b3800b0","7a4d21a8b21c7f0bf6d0039486c2a999ec495bab","c3b2d52e1b6b1a022174efd09bd59af17c9f45d8","ca639559dc893c3cb435ec7fa6810c26018c5a9a"],"title":"Modeling Endogenous Mobility in Earnings Determination.","doi":"10.1080/07350015.2017.1356727"}

The parameters of the distribution can then be related to covariates, such as dose, in a clinical trial through the generation of a beta regression model. In this article, we explore locally optimal designs for this class of regression models, focusing mainly on minimization of the generalized variance of maximum likelihood estimators (D-optimality). Optimal designs and sensitivity to misspecification of model parameters are examined using a candidate points searching algorithm. Although formally the model assumes that the response is continuous, it provides a parsimonious approximation for ordinal data when there is a relatively large number of categories. The resulting estimators and optimal designs are simpler and may offer more ease in interpretation than those derived from models for ordered categorical outcomes. The proposed methods are applied to data from a clinical trial.","inCitations":["97d217e6115364ed42c7e049da04171c28f45a34","c7b3d5aeefd4c63c216df5fa4d2dfe551774f0fc"],"title":"Optimal design for dose response using beta distributed responses.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200067760"}

Familywise error rate-controlling methods do not scale up well, and false discovery rate-controlling methods do scale up well with increasing k. But neither method scales up well with increasing sample size (n) when testing point nulls. We develop a loss function approach to investigate scale-up properties of various methods; we find that while Efron's recent proposal scales up best when both sample size n and number of tests k increase, but its performance otherwise can be erratic.","inCitations":["f3a90c12d3b4d686f4eac212790b5a39672c533a","b8137a58732bed2d3f8d5a4ce4fede6b73084625"],"title":"How well do multiple testing methods scale up when both n and k increase?","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.551326"}

We develop a general class of randomization tests based on generating the null distribution of a general test statistic by repeating the adaptive randomized treatment assignment rule holding fixed the sequence of outcome values and covariate vectors actually observed in the trial. We develop broad conditions on the adaptive randomization method and the stochastic mechanism by which outcomes and covariate vectors are sampled that ensure that the type I error is controlled at the level of the randomization test. These conditions ensure that the use of the randomization test protects the type I error against time trends that are independent of the treatment assignments. Under some conditions in which the prognosis of future patients is determined by knowledge of the current randomization weights, the type I error is not strictly protected. We show that response-adaptive randomization can result in substantial reduction in statistical power when the type I error is preserved. Our results also ensure that type I error is controlled at the level of the randomization test for adaptive stratification designs used for balancing covariates.","inCitations":["08cee0de60acc364a9ddc808ff80ca4d83241034","2327bfe1c4bf6beb8769e70737150c41bca737f6","1304d4bab12c3723df3b1e1282b5434d9b0210ac","523a369df23da49dc6877839caef5abfdfce183c","9a4d5afa0422b166714cc25b39d6bf6ee8c69122","da79add0eaf417bbec2b62e13a7783636b15fa51","340347bd17e086097302afa9715b6cc2dd187b84","24d52eaf4f28fb428b88b09b28aab94ba2097c25","19437fc756e412a803bff7e67e493fa0a1711801","394686b8b5a2b597ad2af6b47f67121391665d70","30791947d2f1ecf18a5f568c1a849cbb7cbe5aa3","f6bb1ad7120d3f427da95f31d771eb2036348f13","77d7570b2ed8f91c0b41324dcfe42a733f72cd8c","89be1359fa5380a062c2e63fdbe2e3ca9f856fc1","517f78963f8f5d7191017acfe55eb8be3c2560eb","2f7fcb18fb76fc3a38b02e287639e26bb69fb472"],"title":"Using Randomization Tests to Preserve Type I Error With Response-Adaptive and Covariate-Adaptive Randomization.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2010.12.018"}

There is an increased interest in identifying pathways and pathway elements involved in particular biological processes. Drug discovery efforts, for example, are focused on identifying biomarkers as well as pathways related to a disease. We propose a Bayesian model that addresses this question by incorporating information on pathways and gene networks in the analysis of DNA microarray data. Such information is used to define pathway summaries, specify prior distributions, and structure the MCMC moves to fit the model. We illustrate the method with an application to gene expression data with censored survival outcomes. In addition to identifying markers that would have been missed otherwise and improving prediction accuracy, the integration of existing biological knowledge into the analysis provides a better understanding of underlying molecular processes.","inCitations":["4c7ee54e991ced1de67a63c1df632c15f2fcfaed","6ab9bac818ddf8eb65d887fbf857171aca321644","223e5f812dbbb97b9949ff6cc8d58aa01d531021","799de6bed5de9edfb0becf2fb54cb0e6a8e2608d","09cea80681594d43dba12cbd259f793342af4cc7","432b1902b64771b808b41c93a4e1cc59f1fcc6e4","b3241c57387a969d54fbd2147fff9828903c79c0","e04cf9fd572bc1920f47c50852fb9957cd887140","fead1e98bf8bb7c004f381265a0ac537f3b362ee","08054ad91d099019455c77577fa4cfd0c824d1ae","92480b0e0492fcf305769774afa2b514e4a38b02","73a73996e028a61dac38a4a41ca00932e3b45dab","800336a016ef20754c1d1c185bcda6d338509963","b984d8e78029828ee28272319f5aec2e488829f1","5b777f87b067c3e0bc0f33678a5298ba7bb897ae","8d373f971018d13c25029853f21fd9cc91bd1127","6d543c0cfde67f6e7114140acfa0cd9830ec8279","a9cef1d0413fe15dab0070f0b2911a1900e0c5ee","e5cbe54e8a55b4b6c4fdf9748dfc97450fc25f51","31d159e34907916b6b88933777b42a54c6d7a617","5e531ca606778866a8dea4fdbd6517b4ec401073","7dad382160308e0821143715302671ce5522cf66","1668d5410d6f80390605eade1c59498c1904f4e9","9fb3193bb84ed26e9c6290e5468474b1d4beae31","a881ab5b4083186f669e9fdec7e18d4308a7c6b4","82e47f987a81af4e6be94561679d3988cb962737","efe7454ecc806585b019ebba136a9ab9c23550a8","9592fb155adf11a4e2ab76e15e8b72de06d8b7e9","5e194897365e3c23640d3d74d2d96f66e6f76c8c","a5ae54a38379a506697a68de8631bed6fc222e0a","d1f2d78bf551b97e4c6e0a522d40ce837265c683","0836bec1fd4c8dabbb4dbf4a1c1f57f00d45204b","88187565316304974813b7b0005c388b2875eb81","0e6b358328b1f7b99f3f73ad0828ed76656f7e53","6a97886edf962e74037fbbef202a3619f22e10b3","79e881384a26f9ecc3d27d79730dabdab8f67f59","548708716da60a34a66c157d50bc355fd302d77e","4b9e56cc473dd28cfaaafdad0628436e964bb103","21d5f2d8dac3df5e2944cb610a720e7a0fcd52ff","09d14b97dcbc563a3234f42bf4bfa7be2b4919e2","7056fc8b2f5304680b66113559e03732ea8cf8e8","9ff4ab6dcd96a5fa5d3de095d1a8d3d1c279152f","164a0bfa1e709ffd890cd86ef301fbd0c159e18e","01ef8188746b8dad22a57f9b4fdfb4d6d4922808","410046116fb4d00097fce17c875d76db6f84c0f6","ee8c6a8f4066845a0d9028fcc770b4727ea0a5a4","8343250095a99d86069c0bde472613724bf4a4c7","79c232a4971a6a0fb86972285aee209494c06423","c11203d844fcf0ea1bb007f9b04b53da8e9276c8","efff63cd0743834c0815ac6a68a8f5a4c718612d","ec95e20806f40229f80d76d01fb86093406483b5","66d6e3b7f7b4a677cb09be44dec4e99636ad1e4a","07921c5aea3d61461418d2bcc538043faf224b39","ec40538b63e6db274b8aaf6bb16ead3db814fb83","1715ed65b9c1034d1addb7e295d55e2caa902607","5403882bd4edec1194b3565293a0c1e7f1eefb03","e427fdcb968c1d8ccf743cd5c8f7feaace3e3f63","51ad49ec3d38dbdbe5d94a38a5d2c3deb03942ec","77e3ee9d54af8240cc6fbafe34b0ce9563eeef0a","eda066fed23fdb472978f845c124252e4fdf03a7","5926c877b8ad271203ee2cbeb40b4bd29d570051","ef24d7e0e22ca5c4eca6521674b9db558cac2088","e124d9685dc9c78882b8ec33b96a5f43fa8f3df0","741b6f34e8c9e9b98091703625fa6885ba680b1f","4717390d356250bb229ac2acdd3041ed2e560892","5d748997032120d9da22faf2df86a9cbbcb72945","360474c808f09978947480d1542661fc32a9113d","1f1079c02a0ae85a44f4976b9cd84cce2c29db75","9dcfaacd0e27f21c72f67d30c3a70c10252306d5","09c2b7208e58fdd666c5ec664e94f10b7462b780","4320e1a34b2286cee3dc39eee53e24434116476c","976bffe77a789d3d8dcc4e332775ba9d779e8876","b33f1b6fa74156302211bd400e3e660fbc305a5f","e5ca770fbdaaecb492e80c0cd1b627bfbb6865f9","4bf046283c1f71c6d0e3919a442fc24a1f4cc9ac"],"title":"Incorporating Biological Information into Linear Models: a Bayesian Approach to the Selection of Pathways and Genes.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS463"}

ABE is usually assessed by means of the confidence interval inclusion principle. Here, the interval under consideration was the standard 'shortest' interval, which is the mainstream approach in practice. The evaluation was performed by means of a simulation study under different combinations of carryover and residual variability besides of formulation effect and sample size. The evaluation was made in terms of percentage of ABE declaration, coverage and interval precision. As is well known, high levels of variability distort the ABE procedures, particularly its type II error control (i.e. high variabilities make difficult to declare bioequivalence when it holds). The effect of carryover is modulated by variability and is especially disturbing for the type I error control. In the presence of carryover, the risk of erroneously declaring bioequivalence may become high, especially for low variabilities and large sample sizes. We end up with some hints concerning the controversy about pretesting for carryover before performing ABE analysis.","inCitations":["1c1f4c319325929b59447930e888099d42b0ec3f","272c652928c9a60b8b4931f697c565bd4f252a23","1b7159b90395a482f633adee868c15aa8139c4d7","48a29f14ed61a49da4f11b34402ea6c42d95dbd3"],"title":"The effect of variability and carryover on average bioequivalence assessment: a simulation study.","doi":"10.1002/pst.431"}

This paper considers a bidimensional (content acquiescence) factor-analytic model to be the correct model, and assesses the effects of fitting unidimensional models to theoretically unidimensional scales when acquiescence is in fact operating. The analysis considers two types of scales: non-balanced and fully balanced. The effects are analysed at both the calibration and the scoring stages, and are of two types: bias in the item/respondent parameter estimates and model/person misfit. The results obtained theoretically are checked and assessed by means of simulation. The results and predictions are then assessed in an empirical study based on two personality scales. The implications of the results for applied personality research are discussed.","inCitations":["f410e0df2ec54459ddd8727ea95553e6bb491443","b587326da519e87d92a4fba7570a17e470c5158a","20bb64b12dcc4d65d58e76375c2f90666f07db3f","447a87fe58cf4a97beba2942aac0a6113416ba9a","a029f86feada333a806ca5d6c63a0d3fc2a335b0","7333c39e35475141ca454c36d162f9510c662df9","acdafa862c67e1a2fef20cb82fc92f5c0ef07301","159d90aa903ccf149688c3125fce8ade835ec088","c299a617c473cecf121774489fbbbdd08bba2d16","fc0ea1531f82b52d7a02283d74deb21b7ebdd113","a021bd7c3ecc6de78e3f3be1988107896eade3b8","8eff2f9c3c7797528cb592d73fcf0678bfadb558","54210f5435f543cbcb82326079732fabb4f0a516","eb604092e72d09b53f31ce57446472c1d18d7673","7788c54df34ef7eb0ea29a980cb1a6a7263894de"],"title":"Acquiescence as a source of bias and model and person misfit: a theoretical and empirical analysis.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X470740"}

It is shown how the generalized loglinear model can be used to represent poset data that form a lattice and how latent-variable models can be constructed by further specifying the canonical parameters of the loglinear representation. The approach generalizes a class of latent-variable models for completely ordered data. We apply the methods to analyse data on the frequency and intensity of anger-related feelings.

Non-linearity is modelled with time transformations known as fractional polynomials (FPs) having power terms that can be negative values and fractions with conventional polynomials (CPs) as a special case. Issues of interpretation are discussed with a focus on the instantaneous rate of change in models with and without static correlates. Methods for model selection are presented with emphasis on penalized and non-penalized indices of global fit based on the maximized likelihood and fitted models. Two empirical examples are presented with psychological data in which FPs were fitted along with CPs of equal and next highest order. The results show that the FPs had equal or better fit than the higher-order CPs and had prediction curves with as favourable or more favourable characteristics, such as less extreme behaviour at the edges of the observed time intervals. The results illustrate some of the potential advantages of FPs relative to CPs, which include parsimony, flexibility of curve shape, and the ability to approximate asymptotes. Though FPs are not necessarily suggested as replacements for CPs or other transformations (e.g. piecewise models), they might be useful when the goal is to model non-linear growth trends with smooth curves.","inCitations":["60ed2c926d4308cdc96fbeff6f46955a2cecf6dd","6b9b5de5b2895640b2ed23a30e873effe938a11e","4fec526724484e587223426702b423d557b150b8","97caf1e328c2cf04e23fb98627ea8baf77b9f52f","026b3a01ca40cef76b78366ae99d583ef730006f","63b231e3e749da0c32b33d82e2ff8bd98b568f76","9fccec839ecb7035b80e309c59e682cd1093a3a1","51a87d8308742cdd3d7435d9645a5514755ce17f","b0d196a73a3b79acef9196d9aa77e873d0321be0","37c114908385a72436a8e765c2c9bffcf44070e3","a3e61f2ffa6562a4312748c9b48c8348169ec4e8","21a74897d008e7ddc8ec14e26ebf8567162d7e11","bca669e3e6468b456c7ca061b50a6b082cac9934","c20a4e785621961ce4e235c7cc3c3f35fa4fcbb9","0b45df0e26247cbbd807619ce85982f6c32ba178","ab821a66605bccfcdfdfb7806f383c1670f2275c","de490a3151bd7ce7419f7b2b8ec6cad3f7a10086","3579d5c19df9251baf54af724434945c656c0c80","77613f58ff1fc393ba4c7a603f3643eae84d02b3","11a7b6333889644e46d04d9218f6728a23b99e1c","88a5382dbf4f10c3345648f516c8dd765fe67af2","1b3afbb07d17e18a30b34bd1e062cb0c169e8f68","71bbc22e23fc6daf5fcf9148467cd492dcb58f74","050ea7096488a8aa7bad90474b9d8c80eba26ae9","a9887a4e6d3e54918322e61d0fab589ad12dc1ff","46d60b48d4a2d26e874c49bfe2690192aa21492f","28dede96cdd442722bc307e398e332a09a29ab1a","9426c7ec56715d4063ed95400d03d5e2bb3852b0","8ffe0fd25adf850f3f9fa8202bd512ff06730201","f0bb36a0287d41a63404633c0a853a5e4d1ca7e9","bc4584585119338eab9ff4336691ff8721793799","a859e2ca7bfeab6ab88b13d3850c17b4408aa13c","09ea7e3fedf7deee760e23cd7399209f7c15ff24","456a0f1555ea97d18ed9166c766f10c2ad369dc5","bce431d0f25c8524a6de59ba5c4d54bdd2fd08da","93ad4491887cda87e51871575426a120f565b27b"],"title":"Using fractional polynomials to model non-linear trends in longitudinal data.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X431509"}

The proposed methodology is applied to point pattern data sets of locations of tropical rain forest trees.","inCitations":["0daa7f011134fe249f194d44334c3f4a8c31fc10","c179430cffc457ea9fcf0936558f1db759b1c9aa","2bcede2110eea9c911b4e521ba2eb7a2247a6ebb","145fbaabb825a8c1dad90dae75e0548cf20db622","300f6a6d35c3da19bdd3dabf94c647dfdb79e0ba","c2e37ab42bad55ebdaf395dde5a88310c6cd21f1","3c852d3a6cbd217b84f88bf602dfd488c271a07d","f959bb1cbb317a1ec03d63c0cf3760f43a5a42a0","6c490eea4eab76f390203b8cd8435e29738d819f","13d0bb9618818444fb5e3a426e7f80a14cfc1772","052a72e350aeebe421c4b6b7e516dcb57acf0cad","21a1ef6003b170670d0c1f13d0612ef00f540005","21de3a44e47a0ffbc4567d229fa3e6cc8f2defe3","19b7d39e7c88d2d3430eba7afe207ceea305d711","3150f966019ceefeb3ffd90a5325f33c73304e9a","51460cf6f1be56e58601f009a3c8ecaff306c5aa","13ab05637b7c98a087af141776841a2ccf29fc44","4e2909c057de164d43ee4e52464858089042df97","849d6e886e723206c9c75037cd9432e35a3de9df","432e36b9e4e36a58dab93ba79cb2ae80a35a5269","0fffc5e29c294d88740ffad9a8693d41e5d0087e","aaab305c4dbc0373bb3fe8bf371be7b2d86a8849","de3fec50cbefe9bfe4f89e95f337b91e47535098","48ea82389510658db2335ffb72282781ee3c403e","5c773db9f08eb45999c31c28e480af9a623be02d","93aef129e37e8daba19ce1c455593e2224cca231"],"title":"Decomposition of Variance for Spatial Cox Processes.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9469.2012.00795.x"}

For example, the manifold may correspond to the surface of a hypersphere. We propose a general kernel mixture model for the joint distribution of the response and predictors, with the kernel expressed in product form and dependence induced through the unknown mixing measure. We provide simple sufficient conditions for large support and weak and strong posterior consistency in estimating both the joint distribution of the response and predictors and the conditional distribution of the response. Focusing on a Dirichlet process prior for the mixing measure, these conditions hold using von Mises-Fisher kernels when the manifold is the unit hypersphere. In this case, Bayesian methods are developed for efficient posterior computation using slice sampling. Next we develop Bayesian nonparametric methods for testing whether there is a difference in distributions between groups of observations on the manifold having unknown densities. We prove consistency of the Bayes factor and develop efficient computational methods for its calculation. The proposed classification and testing methods are evaluated using simulation examples and applied to spherical data applications.","inCitations":["4356002ee288700d10767c6a55969599c58a149b","7239419defcba0e583d07941f768ac26b49f44e1","90a24c79665c900e78e3639580d38dae0e5221d3","da5e7b1aec5bcb6ac83b4a15411542bd8cd8d0c8","ff5e8d49c43ac9d5331999ceab6c85194438778e","a4dfa70d63cec4b0a0c2d5822d81dc9d1bbec173","334e1ccd6877e39f080b2f3f9dc70872c32093da","94a31f23c7bf3720e2241a2fb19f0330f86a93b0","d56613c2b7e78d09c803e4cf75aae9ff4996d025","0fb6d3083338cce046d6452eb8e66f8aac1354ef","44475fa8d5b9a5c47df9442ce1c8e980e1eb93d0"],"title":"Nonparametric Bayes classification and hypothesis testing on manifolds","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2012.02.020"}

In statistical terms the residue is a life table for the transit time of injected radiotracer atoms. The residue provides a description of the tracer kinetic information measurable by a dynamic PET scan. Decomposition of the residue function allows separation of rapid vascular kinetics from slower blood-tissue exchanges and tissue retention. For voxel-level analysis, we propose that residues be modeled by mixtures of nonparametrically derived basis residues obtained by segmentation of the full data volume. Spatial and temporal aspects of diagnostics associated with voxel-level model fitting are emphasized. Illustrative examples, some involving cancer imaging studies, are presented. Data from cerebral PET scanning with 18F fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) and 15O water (H2O) in normal subjects is used to evaluate the approach. Cross-validation is used to make regional comparisons between residues estimated using adaptive mixture models with more conventional compartmental modeling techniques. Simulations studies are used to theoretically examine mean square error performance and to explore the benefit of voxel-level analysis when the primary interest is a statistical summary of regional kinetics. The work highlights the contribution that multivariate analysis tools and life-table concepts can make in the recovery of local metabolic information from dynamic PET studies, particularly ones in which the assumptions of compartmental-like models, with residues that are sums of exponentials, might not be certain.","inCitations":["30e854150cfd380a412042885965e6eb587d8ef1","9afad37b7f2a4ce9b70aaefd53ead8d895fd1534","2bb82c422bed77030e1229f5a8d94874ce70d154","2c69c5545d1832903295ead721f2ae717c8de9b4"],"title":"Voxel-level Mapping of Tracer Kinetics in Pet Studies: a Statistical Approach Emphasizing Tissue Life Tables.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS732"}

This paper addresses phase II/III settings where the joint goals are to increase the average time to treatment failure and control the probability of toxicity while accounting for patient heterogeneity. We are motivated by the desire to construct a feasible design for a trial of four chemotherapy combinations for treating a family of rare pediatric brain tumors. We present a hybrid two-stage design based on two-dimensional treatment effect parameters. A targeted parameter set is constructed from elicited parameter pairs considered to be equally desirable. Bayesian regression models for failure time and the probability of toxicity as functions of treatment and prognostic covariates are used to define two-dimensional covariate-adjusted treatment effect parameter sets. Decisions at each stage of the trial are based on the ratio of posterior probabilities of the alternative and null covariate-adjusted parameter sets. Design parameters are chosen to minimize expected sample size subject to frequentist error constraints. The design is illustrated by application to the brain tumor trial design.","inCitations":["234f062b7e158859acb7f17d5f734b3875372cb8"],"title":"A Hybrid Geometric Phase II/III Clinical Trial Design based on Treatment Failure Time and Toxicity.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2011.10.016"}

There have been many attempts to adapt statistical models for regression and classification to these data, and in many cases these attempts have challenged the computational resources. In this article we expose a class of techniques based on quadratic regularization of linear models, including regularized (ridge) regression, logistic and multinomial regression, linear and mixture discriminant analysis, the Cox model and neural networks. For all of these models, we show that dramatic computational savings are possible over naive implementations, using standard transformations in numerical linear algebra.","inCitations":["d8afc4a46ff6029fcdbdfd76c4baa51b4947ae79","69ab4622c2cad8a6e03c5061cb1a563e57ff0e31","940f1885163567575f83114bf05ca9ec522fd204","8a8ec7b22ded7e455b1d156d0a57f3eba9cf38b0","1f5649d77ac70a9a15af9dcf3b82618d9639fdb4","267d0e4cfbecf7206ceeb768af8dd54bbe57c15c","2733104bba2da24a0012d08b01c311d0fdb33f57","a4fb48693386e3dd60c7d20ea24c130825231dab","d5d6069fd3f8da435fef612355c1755384fc311a","320649cb417cadc0ede81472bf728ba968779a77","b4defdf53fd21cb949dd53c325ddee91317ac0ca","8b659c8802b8ccaa1285c85a4a0ae2d0885584c2","5e2f92363a82ca7a52d59c915e274344b2377fe8","584ec8734b83461a8c277914ba409402b70443b9","cf68894d42eab1ad0503b061340884d93527133a","51d84feedb642ba2b0daa222f65c3f059c3efe98","51f600e30708cf81b0ae91d1293859bc30e42b6a","a1da4b548e2911063569815cdbb6641a80c2c9bc","e9d77a85bc2fa672cc1bd10258c896c8d89b41e8","1f9b0b0a6a402c1f2a8d4227a49312d917720c28","3419afcc15e0e77b5a22d3430321ff199d2add76","97e0f4f69b573824186ac5bd675dc1da2761b4e4","422881a91b829de95c2fede12ce58c36fb1aba68","6cd205132c786e3bc03964fb63380cd3cf51b9c7","bc85c2a7df8207afe6cd2cf1306ad957a296ee5a","8dea6ebc06a57dfc461dd8aea36c5a00c8dedcf0","5d6939fd731649dfcd33fbfa18fe964e4621ac68","4c5d6d3e3c721e7eb8cab0bfbf684cf575b0b8e2","5c0733e855d2ed5455e164c88f178fc5bf354047","d7ba132724a985d2c4b7acc3a2ceda94c5ac9e48","1699f4253d2e204241ff2dac40ad389e14d701b4","c309b24917b6008f3c64ebf29293fedff552e7da","d443e25cbb1cf21e1175066ff0c7a30ebc3ee2e6","ba6cd102cd8dfb4de88074faf4e4da95e0ac0ead","d7acd034f55fd0aedc2074a61ac2929809951ea1","021e9a22e85b0ae4aec4cb2b38daa1c1936f1f6f","f2a647e698f2c84f4219d27dbd6a2dd77e547df5","be110cdd6c5568cf2cbc14ad732a750c8da9f2f8","b1133d9ac89463b3d89b0e5be12f7ab21d45e473","52b876a95eb4db5bb8e093e98a2649c53253b428","d77e6a572c02ea56f8579dd7679e6ce31a2e24b7","e9203177f9926a47aef8b165574b4bc2fda46cda","4b10d37fddbbab46ea21a64856e42747653cc5de","08db4f982230d1a9377b0e2b673ded8878783224","265c959ee04810d7fb126aa300383588b4a4acb0","c8645157e5ab53d04d0d3fc9fbe0f9310d065cf5","00b7f44857676600805172e99be6f9f2987e98eb","bd55e4c5b9843b411f9f783528f5fa70580af70f","ddd3018a0446015d849175748d422d73d67677d8","f580869ae3ff72da3b81a1b2f96a3e3657c97f78","a5693c7d1e89397a17f30b85aa6a6874de69d255","559294f3d41051cf71afce6bf168f1a64f7fe87a","2b6047629a1f88ef40f0c6c64052a4a6866b061f","760ea00c214a872ed94c18d40d7c0945a865aae3","92a6aee9c05a866a50a22f0bb37a8e0dfeb4eb20","f4e0373adb98cc5f067996f0712b250a1aeb7ab6","f58bd5915adfe675564d3763337cb5276523dd18","d2bfc658f5364a7af842433aa8a4341fa806236f","24634dc854ed5121d892e7ef764fefee9133265b","adf7bbb917df8ca424542688eb4bc7dec37a30b9","b535543318286f116571dcf5a83da4cd561254bf"],"title":"Efficient quadratic regularization for expression arrays.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxh010"}
