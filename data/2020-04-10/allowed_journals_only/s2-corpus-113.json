Each student is asked to affirm or deny multiple instances of violence in his/her dating relationship. There is, however, evidence suggesting that students not in a relationship responded to the survey, resulting in excessive zeros in the responses. This paper proposes likelihood-based and estimating equation approaches to analyze the zero-inflated clustered binary response data. We adopt a mixed model method to account for the cluster effect, and the model parameters are estimated using a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach that requires a Gaussian-Hermite quadrature (GHQ) approximation for implementation. Since an incorrect assumption on the random effects distribution may bias the results, we construct generalized estimating equations (GEE) that do not require the correct specification of within-cluster correlation. In a series of simulation studies, we examine the performance of ML and GEE methods in terms of their bias, efficiency and robustness. We illustrate the importance of properly accounting for this zero inflation by reanalyzing the NEXT data where this issue has previously been ignored.","inCitations":["ab470032fecd80c1d58ac429a7ca920eb834cf01","38b14e69fa6a1891d6e1be018362a291f3c3bd65","1d4e40f0b37d1e57fefb0eef4e8dbf47b04d9ac6","fbbee8268b61d747f8cee00fa5be9a8138db9b58"],"title":"Mixed Model and Estimating Equation Approaches for Zero Inflation in Clustered Binary Response Data with Application to a Dating Violence Study.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS791"}

The indirect inference involves the direct comparison of the test treatment with the active control from the noninferiority trial and the assessment, via some type of meta-analyses, of the effect of the active control relative to a placebo from historical studies. The traditional within-noninferiority-trial Type I error rate cannot ascertain the statistical risks associated with the indirect inference, though this error rate is of the primary consideration under the frequentist statistical framework. Another kind of Type I error rate, known as across-trial Type I error rate, needs to be considered in order that the statistical risks associated with the indirect inference can be controlled at a small level. Consideration of the two kinds of Type I error rates is also important for defining a noninferiority margin. For the indirect statistical inference, the practical utility of any method that controls only the across-trial Type I error rate at a fixed small level is limited.","inCitations":["b27d787957825af6c4e94872f4b2b5d1b09800c8","78169908eda3ba6dcc539dfe8f72ccb62022a9f0","c6d3bcc6e6709891c2d72551e325460ed9b4c51c","42d73217f5d86f14158c5d6fe59a567f396e312b","79e78a6719f90735f3a3a8e5bfe4d6d0c2ae30b7","923f7fe28aa0f76526facb5ed519931c1d8d09d1","e922374ddccfa455e491147654c8378ef0c994f9","f4bf014cbff4e6593e1c2feca7b277b4607a5083","543cf46c9d1005f38ca73f9085bf5cb23ad6b18f","7f8e2ae23187f365e3d98e2982919620345fe839"],"title":"Issues with statistical risks for testing methods in noninferiority trial without a placebo ARM.","doi":"10.1080/10543400601177343"}

However, little attention has been devoted to the development of efficient design strategies for sibling studies in terms of optimizing power. We here address this issue in commonly encountered types of sibling studies, allowing for continuous and binary outcomes and varying numbers of exposed and unexposed siblings. For continuous outcomes, we show that in families with sibling pairs, optimal study power is obtained by recruiting discordant (exposed–control) pairs of siblings. More generally, balancing the exposure status within each family as evenly as possible is shown to be optimal. For binary outcomes, we elucidate how the optimal strategy depends on the variation of the binary response; as the within-family correlation increases, the optimal strategy tends toward only recruiting discordant sibling pairs (as in the case of continuous outcomes). R code for obtaining the optimal strategies is included.","inCitations":["a7badcd23997ca7da505354e5e336ddf1f93aff8"],"title":"Optimal Design Strategies for Sibling Studies with Binary Exposures","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2014-0015"}

The dimensionality was first reduced via a high-dimensional (approximate) factor model implemented by the principal component analysis. Using the extracted factors, we develop a novel forecasting method called the sufficient forecasting, which provides a set of sufficient predictive indices, inferred from high-dimensional predictors, to deliver additional predictive power. The projected principal component analysis will be employed to enhance the accuracy of inferred factors when a semi-parametric (approximate) factor model is assumed. Our method is also applicable to cross-sectional sufficient regression using extracted factors. The connection between the sufficient forecasting and the deep learning architecture is explicitly stated. The sufficient forecasting correctly estimates projection indices of the underlying factors even in the presence of a nonparametric forecasting function. The proposed method extends the sufficient dimension reduction to high-dimensional regimes by condensing the cross-sectional information through factor models. We derive asymptotic properties for the estimate of the central subspace spanned by these projection directions as well as the estimates of the sufficient predictive indices. We further show that the natural method of running multiple regression of target on estimated factors yields a linear estimate that actually falls into this central subspace. Our method and theory allow the number of predictors to be larger than the number of observations. We finally demonstrate that the sufficient forecasting improves upon the linear forecasting in both simulation studies and an empirical study of forecasting macroeconomic variables.","inCitations":["629201384405a694d42f438d38b25cb886509f03","f4d8cee984f19ca812c271f160420706ac6557c4","467a99a115a00aab6f05a7076bc93002e5cb7b83","c152cfe5e9bc2feb00b786db85c115c2f18bf987","5b1b45dd9c55f0f37ca05c513b0ee72b55827007","7c3bee580c0fe10ce0abbe76c86e689120f54e00","c812108855e32041158e7621ce902e913bd24785","a96be447b2c81463780bbc29324c7be9de75a212","fa6b5fc74bc1bb985ffd5ea522af7c4b5dcfedc4","1c4d66eedec623ceebc50a237e52789fdd7d371e","0bcf73e0bff568c5819481105ce589762c4a585c","9138182644dd05a9d84d772cb29c463ac9a9e9a3","45fd5114138ba03a10d1696f5d02239d2a5aa5ae","173e99da929b5cee1526c9e18f5e7be799c022dc","1fffab513a3aecfb1d5f3e03c3d489e45d848584","c0bdfbc55badc3c729c060f17d9a6e07de184088","4c93ea4e4e605786d590acf5639662a14a2060fa","b5006cbd8af052ceb3f36fc66ef22a5d72db15f0","3a0dcd2529c4a891e320e13adf8f978513ee181e"],"title":"Sufficient Forecasting Using Factor Models.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2017.08.009"}

These effects are of interest because they allow for effect decomposition of a total effect into a direct and indirect effect even in the presence of interactions or non-linear models. In this paper, we consider the relation and interpretation of various identification assumptions in terms of causal diagrams interpreted as a set of non-parametric structural equations. We show that for such causal diagrams, two sets of assumptions for identification that have been described in the literature are in fact equivalent in the sense that if either set of assumptions holds for all models inducing a particular causal diagram, then the other set of assumptions will also hold for all models inducing that diagram. We moreover build on prior work concerning a complete graphical identification criterion for covariate adjustment for total effects to provide a complete graphical criterion for using covariate adjustment to identify natural direct and indirect effects. Finally, we show that this criterion is equivalent to the two sets of independence assumptions used previously for mediation analysis.","inCitations":["5f0c91ad34248188998ca5a7adf97a59a241e246","9066cadba1034afc911f3434da12bebdd5e65833","90917d105943223f662cbe8b7da126f092f7e850","f0d9f39a4807aea3a8a0ca01608365ed41057fbb","40e00c944ca01028aee3d6741d06869fd5a17f09","fe4b55a52753f00c41c0253b914c0788ea9edff0","b29507a6af454423257757f4b4f1d3c703ff9879","ab99b239bc2ee3161e6a0ff0b0e23909db6ea18a","b1b73c1acc2f39c7b66813ee317759e78bfa3723","4fcc3aeb3d164c12a5a8daf2d5d0d574525f77cb","535b5b45ac643bf5b7a7d2ae50b613627abca6fd","863a3b679cfc587fab082f741c26f8dc7af52104","b8c49a471827b4702cfbd4e31541dc8b978b4688","61ab59f93c7caa1e964ae386d494e09d0af0bcff","950f70fee4448a4cee604bb3bef92d0d9bcc8d06","45d850fdc413bfd69dab4137805ac12cb532a4a7","24ba7c0ec8dd615a75e69370a533b542c55eb2d3","fb4fca7aa5653c1412bce70877fe5f4c768cf169","d31120352e0061dd8b384086afce5d8f809f29ab","ba7692925406f531566aaa853f931ebee296b33e","fbb87387de43d01d77e59783051400c2b369e6bd"],"title":"A Complete Graphical Criterion for the Adjustment Formula in Mediation Analysis","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1297"}

However, the capability of existing IV procedures, and most notably the two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) algorithm recommended for use in non-linear contexts, to account for unmeasured confounders in the Cox proportional hazard model is unclear. We show that instrumenting an endogenous treatment induces an unmeasured covariate, referred to as an individual frailty in survival analysis parlance, which if not accounted for leads to bias. We propose a new procedure that augments 2SRI with an individual frailty and prove that it is consistent under certain conditions. The finite sample-size behavior is studied across a broad set of conditions via Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the proposed methodology is used to estimate the average effect of carotid endarterectomy versus carotid stenting on the mortality of patients suffering from carotid artery disease. Results suggest that the 2SRI-frailty estimator generally reduces the bias of both point and interval estimators compared to traditional 2SRI.","inCitations":["a97644a66985ff6958fe6b2cb65a41462144c199","2e46398e0282044dda5c11414f13309114f1726e","81d146739bfa77abbdf2c23b9bf4887e1fe28009","a89dd14b99da3c6e00c8cf5a14d531b74eb6cd90"],"title":"Adjusting for bias introduced by instrumental variable estimation in the Cox proportional hazards model.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx062"}

The method is applied to data from esophageal cancer patients from the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, where the most important covariates are selected in each of the hazards of effusion, death before effusion, and death after effusion. The DIC procedure that is proposed leads to similar selected models regardless of the choices of some of the hyperparameters.

Design-adaptive allocation is a particularly flexible kind of dynamic allocation. Every investigation of dynamic allocation methods has shown that they improve balance of prognostic factors across treatment groups, but there have been lingering doubts about their influence on the validity of statistical inferences. Here we report the results of a simulation study focused on this and similar issues. Overall, it is found that there are no statistical reasons, in the situations studied, to prefer randomization to design-adaptive allocation. Specifically, there is no evidence of bias, the number of participants wasted by randomization in small studies is not trivial, and when the aim is to place bounds on the prediction of population benefits, randomization is quite substantially less efficient than design-adaptive allocation. A new, adjusted permutation estimate of the standard deviation of the regression estimator under design-adaptive allocation is shown to be an unbiased estimate of the true sampling standard deviation, resolving a long-standing problem with dynamic allocations. These results are shown in situations with varying numbers of balancing factors, different treatment and covariate effects, different covariate distributions, and in the presence of a small number of outliers.","inCitations":["1659048a9f8a4c0030ad4d66d7c8f7c157657ccd","a3a98db5a442767013aaa9be641a88d26696b5da","680f5a19091bee1d560a9e66b3ab24ee40fcaf78","a83136b75891c503983acf0d4b1caa3b3df478a6","168d3956c5d97a7c4f32f2bedf69f8e26932abe8","33c60379912a0f71eeded757ddf19b315658aa2e","bceceaf48a42555cf2fddcbd00e959f94c9eefa4","924d04027f7205fb56222bdbbc34a386f7837db3","14682e1e81443cffa7bfe6d6f67cf820c323898d","f6ddcde0a7d867daf2741f15f56ad3f57279bb60","8ec757ea02256607bfca9f0d177e275fd42f3778"],"title":"A Simulation Study of the Validity and Efficiency of Design-Adaptive Allocation to Two Groups in the Regression Situation","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1144"}

We investigate how an age‐structured social contact matrix can be incorporated into a spatio‐temporal endemic‐epidemic model for infectious disease counts. To illustrate the approach, we analyze the spread of norovirus gastroenteritis over six age groups within the 12 districts of Berlin, 2011‐2015, using contact data from the POLYMOD study. The proposed age‐structured model outperforms alternative scenarios with homogeneous or no mixing between age groups. An extended contact model suggests a power transformation of the survey‐based contact matrix toward more within‐group transmission.","inCitations":["f0507a4abc28eb5a0fdfd32ad27dfec21422022b","bb3ab6513644540d6b2eb347b97b9de56c8f36c4","7b5823490bce2dc0f86281ace8910b580c3d95a2","dada33469d4d98ade293e7c6a7db8f0c0a778378","c2729b6509994785a58bced8e1a8f391a1cdee27","676c08e16993a6e19702ecf0bcc59baf3bc7e9c7","bace389eab745706770a2915a2f45e09922bde8a","9acc731550520053c8f8dc9248dd587ea6397114","3e80b6cce37c429834879117388917cb115f7271","7218d5914df53ae5ecb753d2b6ea5d1e2afd0d98","58b1da045bca2327df5e2d1d61e4b04ec62a524e"],"title":"Incorporating social contact data in spatio-temporal models for infectious disease spread","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw051"}

However, these measures of association are only for cross-sectional studies or prospective investigations, such as clinical trials and they cannot be applied to retrospective research such as case-control studies. As a result, under a matched-pair design, we propose the use of the conditional odds ratio for assessment of equivalence in both prospective and retrospective research. We suggest the use of the asymptotic confidence interval of the conditional odds ratio for evaluation of equivalence. In addition, a score test based on the restricted maximum likelihood estimator (RMLE) is derived to test the hypothesis of equivalence under a matched-pair design. On the other hand, a sample size formula is also provided. A simulation study was conducted to empirically investigate the size and power of the proposed procedures. Simulation results show that the score test not only adequately controls the Type I error but it can also provide sufficient power. A numerical example illustrates the proposed methods.","inCitations":["572208c67adf5f4c57e6a86ce60e916f7e29cbf7","80f6c71d0f71008b71ecf0f63171c5104eeb142c","802f4682ac2ae119ecdaf57d00233769ebeb0fb6","c356dae5f2c5a6202304028347c4d7a12256c4f3","c9419efe8b50826f937b51c7994eb37fc09c64ff","bc207693c6a4a5fb4cdd0da119c5cf91639c1006","04df04c8e90bce6e020de437ddb141d3e763ab03","a0c624519f8c98763f6c824e3828d4394dee233f","614aa58033c44a2b03400e0801377076992c03e2"],"title":"Tests for equivalence based on odds ratio for matched-pair design.","doi":"10.1080/10543400500265561"}

We used simulation techniques to determine the small-sample properties of Bayesian estimators of arbitrary performance points, specifically addressing the issues of bias and precision as a function of the target percentage level. The study covered three major types of psychophysical task (yes-no detection, 2AFC discrimination and 2AFC detection) and explored the entire range of target performance levels allowed for by each task. Other factors included in the study were the form and parameters of the actual psychometric function Psi, the form and parameters of the model function M assumed in the Bayesian method, and the location of Psi within the parameter space. Our results indicate that Bayesian adaptive methods render unbiased estimators of any arbitrary point on psi only when M=Psi, and otherwise they yield bias whose magnitude can be considerable as the target level moves away from the midpoint of the range of Psi. The standard error of the estimator also increases as the target level approaches extreme values whether or not M=Psi. Contrary to widespread belief, neither the performance level at which bias is null nor that at which standard error is minimal can be predicted by the sweat factor. A closed-form expression nevertheless gives a reasonable fit to data describing the dependence of standard error on number of trials and target level, which allows determination of the number of trials that must be administered to obtain estimates with prescribed precision.","inCitations":["672a6a96ec2346f1ac6213eacc8e7ef1eb4aa46a","16e665d539f061caec77e01371aa4403bc1913c6","44849a54d217fec5aad7fa38ad2f2e12cbf55df1","324481e73e449d158978c4a1d424c0bd53d356e9","d60f32fd53b3c3a1f171566d5b81976df131f4bc","adb5c13fb827d0b98598d833073e9610c8c84cae","deddf858933aeea97b2513a729758373ef36c50e","726614ad6ffb1004eaa3a7307dea4d910258f800","16a00e84631f2ee5e99767d64139b0d3cad1e4f5","005a9fa99160df491080f2680f09659cc2a8a0a1","7813769cfd608f8040914f026c2e17c6de770911","eec50a312009b9280b8964d874deee59fa6819a9","692344619fdf799e1db9dc7e3464b242ae5b7d21"],"title":"Bayesian adaptive estimation of arbitrary points on a psychometric function.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X104596"}

However, to this day, published examples of its application to real PK-PD problems have been scarce. We present an example of a fully Bayesian re-analysis of a previously published mechanistic model describing the time course of circulating neutrophils in stroke patients and healthy individuals. While priors could be established for all population parameters in the model, not all variability terms were known with any degree of precision. A sensitivity analysis around the assigned priors used was performed by testing three different sets of prior values for the population variance terms for which no data were available in the literature: \"informative\", \"semi-informative\", and \"noninformative\", respectively. For all variability terms, inverse gamma distributions were used. It was possible to fit the model to the data using the \"informative\" priors. However, when the \"semi-informative\" and \"noninformative\" priors were used, it was impossible to accomplish convergence due to severe correlations between parameters. In addition, due to the complexity of the model, the process of defining priors and running the Markov chains was very time-consuming. We conclude that the present analysis represents a first example of the fully transparent application of Bayesian methods to a complex, mechanistic PK-PD problem with real data. The approach is time-consuming, but enables us to make use of all available information from data and scientific evidence. Thereby, it shows potential both for detection of data gaps and for more reliable predictions of various outcomes and \"what if\" scenarios.","inCitations":["510c206e0459e8b1be84a23b0ecd25911ff7ed09","bca37c379db1f4a0943d9555711b70a929d557a1","ff285396414ee1283ae4758cc1ca48bacdaaa663","a5e262d041c7d1e6dd0c3cb9b7078ca12b88f6ae","9b531f31b172ac46032d4f23545b1645fcb9800a","735f87edbbdc78e23c64e01895c20d68e34edd6f","d97e500ea37b4ed380013fa686eee957f66c9607","5b44e473018993a9a37c0fe368c5e414a6890d60","87020afcf22b5cccb66fa664f6a24541f7633ca0","af8cabd915095c2caab208728e93e10a8ee2fd6b","9fbe93baf98f2eddb17266f709cc68aa37a51b8e","ed0e8d7fdd8b6bb8ab9556cc321b711f686b7a42","7abf4c73d988d8d3906c217384bdf99e84c5e5ff"],"title":"The application of a Bayesian approach to the analysis of a complex, mechanistically based model.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600851898"}

Since the chemical composition of PM(2.5) varies across space and time, the association between PM(2.5) and mortality could also change with space and season. In this work we develop and implement a statistical multi-stage Bayesian framework that provides a very broad, flexible approach to studying the spatiotemporal associations between mortality and population exposure to daily PM(2.5) mass, while accounting for different sources of uncertainty. In stage 1, we map ambient PM(2.5) air concentrations using all available monitoring data (IMPROVE and FRM) and an air quality model (CMAQ) at different spatial and temporal scales. In stage 2, we examine the spatial temporal relationships between the health end-points and the exposures to PM(2.5) by introducing a spatial-temporal generalized Poisson regression model. We adjust for time-varying confounders, such as seasonal trends. A common seasonal trends model is to use a fixed number of basis functions to account for these confounders, but the results can be sensitive to the number of basis functions. In this study, the number of the basis functions is treated as an unknown parameter in our Bayesian model and we use a space-time stochastic search variable selection approach.

In the former case, all study subjects are monitored continuously; thus, complete information is available for the underlying recurrent-event processes of interest. In the latter case, study subjects are monitored periodically; thus, only incomplete information is available for the processes of interest. In reality, however, a third type of data could occur in which some study subjects are monitored continuously, but others are monitored periodically. When this occurs, we have mixed recurrent-event and panel-count data. This paper discusses regression analysis of such mixed data and presents two estimation procedures for the problem. One is a maximum likelihood estimation procedure, and the other is an estimating equation procedure. The asymptotic properties of both resulting estimators of regression parameters are established.

Current genetic studies usually collect hundreds to thousands of samples to study the association between CNV and diseases. CNVs can be called by detecting the change-points in mean for sequences of array-based intensity measurements. Although multiple samples are of interest, the majority of the available CNV calling methods are single sample based. Only a few multiple sample methods have been proposed using scan statistics that are computationally intensive and designed toward either common or rare change-points detection. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple sample method by adaptively combining the scan statistic of the screening and ranking algorithm (SaRa), which is computationally efficient and is able to detect both common and rare change-points. We prove that asymptotically this method can find the true change-points with almost certainty and show in theory that multiple sample methods are superior to single sample methods when shared change-points are of interest. Additionally, we report extensive simulation studies to examine the performance of our proposed method. Finally, using our proposed method as well as two competing approaches, we attempt to detect CNVs in the data from the Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Genes and Environment study, and conclude that our method is faster and requires less information while our ability to detect the CNVs is comparable or better.","inCitations":["b330d86d62f1b6c4a401e00903e855fcb4b2548d","a7b9da24784c9277c1636f6837a77add1c55d91c","cbf6dd7664d18ab81d4f300c73c44d2bd475d8be"],"title":"The Screening and Ranking Algorithm for Change-points Detection in Multiple Samples.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS966"}

The overall burden of influenza is captured by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influenza-like illness network, which provides invaluable information about the current incidence. This information is used to provide decision support regarding prevention and response efforts. Despite the relatively rich surveillance data and the recurrent nature of seasonal influenza, forecasting the timing and intensity of seasonal influenza in the U.S. remains challenging because the form of the disease transmission process is uncertain, the disease dynamics are only partially observed, and the public health observations are noisy. Fitting a probabilistic state-space model motivated by a deterministic mathematical model [a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model] is a promising approach for forecasting seasonal influenza while simultaneously accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. A significant finding of this work is the importance of thoughtfully specifying the prior, as results critically depend on its specification. Our conditionally specified prior allows us to exploit known relationships between latent SIR initial conditions and parameters and functions of surveillance data. We demonstrate advantages of our approach relative to alternatives via a forecasting comparison using several forecast accuracy metrics.","inCitations":["549912723a5b266471f537223296530a4c3c8580","7f786d87bd34b94886742cd1ede95fea9f626704","271bbcc0334520c166b681c9554cb9d04698a9d1","08ffffc162e06536a08ebd438043becf4cdf0fba","960fcbbbf416b06f140a324d82c64605973f6f23","3d478d3940bb4973e0d4f4038616dba83177a80d","78f8c65c038c6ee417f19ba335a7b8f0a39695cd","e181419474f84eefc454f0ad0633b14476a3d15a","a5461ffb5bd1b875ed5a1c78c3102a38bd8cda76","bda9982d9486192fa568513c8b81a85d81a27ade","0b6c2a5db4115cabece1653d383b53be2e9e17de","b93bf14470d240c7b82a10c980463031f6e3be38","01049c7b8536301e435c6fef5dcba7cd8cf54192"],"title":"Forecasting seasonal influenza with a state-space SIR model.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS1000"}

Current literature offers some help in designing such studies, but these methods have limitations and mostly apply only in the context of linear mixed models with compound symmetry covariance structure. It is not evident that such models can satisfactorily be employed to represent all kinds of QTc data, and the existing literature inadequately addresses whether there is a change in sample size and power for more general covariance structures for the linear mixed models. We assess the use of some of the existing methods to design a thorough QT study through data arising from a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)-conducted thorough QT study, and explore newer models for sample size calculation. We also provide a new method to calculate the sample size required to detect assay sensitivity with adequate power.","inCitations":["dff4d13fb4b10fd2e8b212e667f5021a4150b925","cec245b81e62ce40e4713b4335764b129bf49937","21e0acbf9d02e189f13dc71e19a927ad667455da","066f67510fdbcd2464145751b978594fd237cb4e","1661cd4f5da7a68da6a478ef69b5ff7591a96c3c","f827c09ec07c22ec4d5c3998a6081d6c2d39b67e","f70daa47bfe95d32ce46ed483ed7756623189e50"],"title":"Sample size calculations for crossover thorough QT studies: satisfaction of regulatory threshold and assay sensitivity.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903582000"}

Adaptive designs that allow for early stopping but also use interim data to adapt the sample size have been proposed as a practical way of dealing with these uncertainties. Predictive power and conditional power are two commonly mentioned techniques that allow predictions of what will happen at the end of the trial based on the interim data. Decisions about stopping or continuing the trial can then be based on these predictions. However, unless the user of these statistics has a deep understanding of their characteristics important pitfalls may be encountered, especially with the use of predictive power. The aim of this paper is to highlight these potential pitfalls. It is critical that statisticians understand the fundamental differences between predictive power and conditional power as they can have dramatic effects on decision making at the interim stage, especially if used to re-evaluate the sample size. The use of predictive power can lead to much larger sample sizes than either conditional power or standard sample size calculations. One crucial difference is that predictive power takes account of all uncertainty, parts of which are ignored by standard sample size calculations and conditional power. By comparing the characteristics of each of these statistics we highlight important characteristics of predictive power that experimenters need to be aware of when using this approach.","inCitations":["6402686ffe29f2d506a7c2f9d52798d92aee2d70","f7f903447114b8c27cc9df757b5a1989900b2c60","4af2afa02b61af1b7fe16533d7c103d65536204e","df336340d66df7e7ceb361427a740b81031011c9","44568dcd125eb2bd279290ded2cdedae0f089f47","6015a7257717643aef6bf800e55ca71c489ca228","6ea392364945fbd1bd006b14738f7bd35dc1c38f"],"title":"The perils with the misuse of predictive power.","doi":"10.1002/pst.467"}

Our work is motivated by multiple studies on the spatio-temporal distribution of mobile source, or traffic related, particles in the greater Boston area. When multiple sources of exposure information are available, a joint model that pools information across sources maximizes data coverage over both space and time, thereby reducing the prediction error. We consider a Bayesian hierarchical framework in which a joint model consists of a set of submodels, one for each data source, and a model for the latent process that serves to relate the submodels to one another. If a submodel depends on the latent process nonlinearly, inference using standard MCMC techniques can be computationally prohibitive. The implications are particularly severe when the data for each submodel are aggregated at different temporal scales. To make such problems tractable, we linearize the nonlinear components with respect to the latent process and induce sparsity in the covariance matrix of the latent process using compactly supported covariance functions. We propose an efficient MCMC scheme that takes advantage of these approximations. We use our model to address a temporal change of support problem whereby interest focuses on pooling daily and multiday black carbon readings in order to maximize the spatial coverage of the study region.","inCitations":["6661c3c55c4ae661b3c58efc8d3991fb9a65347c","0c2f49a240b096a324831ce64f411366623fb6fa","f06e8f1d344d756459d93fcfacbbd9d9140ba443","6619378dd313cad05794b95f13e72d6b88ec16f8"],"title":"Nonlinear Predictive Latent Process Models for Integrating Spatio-temporal Exposure Data from Multiple Sources.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS737"}
