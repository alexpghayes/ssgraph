A reinterpretation of the extended logistic model is proposed. The extended logistic model for the assessment of change (ELMAC) allows the definition of a time parameter which is supposed to identify whether change occurs during a period of time, given a specific event or phenomenon. The assessment of a trend of change through time, on the basis of the time parameter which is estimated at different successive occasions during a period of time, is also considered. In addition, a dispersion parameter is calculated which identifies whether change is consistent at each time point. The issue of independence is taken into account both in relation to the time parameter and the dispersion parameter. An application of the ELMAC in a learning process is presented. The interpretation of the model parameters and the model fit statistics is consistent with expectations.","inCitations":["d6fb2b43ccdaa1a605b631275af467749e12206d","96380803aa3fe6cb19ebc348ca938f446f73d29a","74a265b17fc64581a2208632f209d0d41a4c69fd"],"title":"Assessing change with the extended logistic model.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X107548"}

However, unlike logistic regression for odds ratios, the standard log-binomial model for RR regression does not respect the natural parameter constraints and is therefore often subject to numerical instability. In this paper, we develop a reliable and flexible method for fitting log-binomial models. We use an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm where the multiplicative event probability is viewed as the joint probability for a collection of latent binary outcomes. This gives a simple iterative scheme that provides stable convergence to the maximum likelihood estimate. In addition to reliability, the method offers some flexible generalizations, including models with unspecified isotonic regression functions. We examine the method's performance using simulations and data analyses of the age-specific RR of mortality following heart attack. These analyses demonstrate the potential for numerical instability in RR regression and show how this can be overcome using the proposed approach. Source code to implement the method in R is provided as supplementary material available at Biostatistics online.","inCitations":["67b02304ea4677193a27ffdfafc28a845d9d6dd0","6e4cdf1790f316c8b1fa9253814c2997a5d6ea4d","a02edc1fcaeee48432bcaa639c78b90d33ec4bbd","67a06d5a9aba7d9e9ecaaabf6f1b878abb6a072f","728f17c3f1647f91426aa285e06c027d261469b8","e4ea3bb7706c9f5151e8c979041fc913c5dd556f","daca81f49a1b3db49d9070cac1e17869cc924029","dbfc16f86d93e84bcdb3a3ad7b92694c82d796e1","1b3a83e3d76d8890f940fce99330505511fa8910","ec9e9a608fb7f3e36944e8ecc5b09b9f0b61045e","2d10c280d4748b97b8d5bd00d60657b850eb8150","9d482b231e51fda7a6945ef4b0936a5aea90a0a2","d7362a294bb28288b9d379c19abaddf1f6371985","8c06e4b99736d9ab3a0215cc9299b5525156abfb","e6ca24f2b7280fde853a4439005b2195f0b983e6","5214c09bfe21bda012d15d417b503503fd55c70c","20413a42dcde1e6957307c9d06d519debf1e67c1","9e62a8304e427d1989efa758b43ae96cd2456edb","e5d33b4fcd2ed1393d0105cdade08586cf843afd","5d6ea09e9a33a841d1fced82bab44fb69b690e69","779f37b5c82fd4913aae29d19d7e0cd0d2bc00e4","dd3f57a4a15d897766ce3590cbfc50edb4e61b47","a220816ef455829f08246e2ff1285d35ef42f305","af69ea9b7be61c280a881f1af185583fc3d3aa86","88c3d8df7803aafc61fe55bffb09d6250cac4c89","914bad3f8cd9499e477583e6369e292d7243e5e6","7fd70bee2fe428da62d5a0d2c0fb74788a629a48"],"title":"Relative risk regression: reliable and flexible methods for log-binomial models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr030"}

In recent years, device manufacturers are increasingly using stochastic engineering models during the product development process. These models have the capability to simulate virtual patient outcomes. This article presents a novel method based on the power prior for augmenting a clinical trial using virtual patient data. To properly inform clinical evaluation, the virtual patient model must simulate the clinical outcome of interest, incorporating patient variability, as well as the uncertainty in the engineering model and in its input parameters. The number of virtual patients is controlled by a discount function which uses the similarity between modeled and observed data. This method is illustrated by a case study of cardiac lead fracture. Different discount functions are used to cover a wide range of scenarios in which the type I error rates and power vary for the same number of enrolled patients. Incorporation of engineering models as prior knowledge in a Bayesian clinical trial design can provide benefits of decreased sample size and trial length while still controlling type I error rate and power.","inCitations":["ffcd1e4f7975c5a743aa72eabc3b1171ef9add0e","ff17bf0cb9b9279c083eff54e537a1c67838fa56","87e0b038e18adba442db14945ef35f0ef2966a2b","54a7cbae2d05f92364520c95a9fbce2e342b026a","9db88d47f415e38061fa2d2f027a892757b9bab4","958c75c473432178a045f2b850dbb2b5d76ea43c","56b9af330abae43bfc8e52751040795e0a4d5635","12e9ae9a0c62874479e4424bab6d3956028a8f01","d94be16e8f55c0e5995ed612c42dab5bb9fbb9ae","4dc00bbed8ec8c19fd97dde896c5b894da7f7cdb"],"title":"Incorporation of stochastic engineering models as prior information in Bayesian medical device trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1300907"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"A biosimilar refers to a follow-on biologic intended to be approved for marketing based on biosimilarity to an existing patented biological product (i.e., the reference product). To develop a biosimilar product, it is essential to demonstrate biosimilarity between the follow-on biologic and the reference product, typically through two-arm randomization trials. We propose a Bayesian adaptive design for trials to evaluate biosimilar products. To take advantage of the abundant historical data on the efficacy of the reference product that is typically available at the time a biosimilar product is developed, we propose the calibrated power prior, which allows our design to adaptively borrow information from the historical data according to the congruence between the historical data and the new data collected from the current trial. We propose a new measure, the Bayesian biosimilarity index, to measure the similarity between the biosimilar and the reference product. During the trial, we evaluate the Bayesian biosimilarity index in a group sequential fashion based on the accumulating interim data, and stop the trial early once there is enough information to conclude or reject the similarity. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed design has higher power than traditional designs. We applied the proposed design to a biosimilar trial for treating rheumatoid arthritis.","inCitations":["ac4ba76c19fed65797654c345b150407bc715ab7","3485c87ea4c014b50e93759f1e9f021421a083d6"],"title":"A Calibrated Power Prior Approach to Borrow Information from Historical Data with Application to Biosimilar Clinical Trials.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12204"}

Along with fixed regression coefficients, we introduce random coefficients which we assume to follow a form of multivariate Laplace distribution. In a simulation study, the proposed quantile mixed-effects regression is shown to model the dependence among longitudinal data correctly and estimate the fixed effects efficiently. It performs similarly to the linear mixed model at the central location when the regression errors are symmetrically distributed, but provides more efficient estimates when the errors are over-dispersed. At the same time, it allows the estimation at different locations of conditional distribution, which conveys a comprehensive understanding of data. We illustrate an application to clinical data where the outcome variable of interest is bounded within a closed interval.","inCitations":["34a19f6fd7dc9fd124a0d76142742ab91e12ba31","af2e7ba7c4605c6c81bd706853540ceeb1fc42ba","b2298f941b9bf257e7b0dccfa784fc0568483687","c426cdbc9904fa026ec7def0657b7867dee818b0","954e47203e22258f6a3850a7eb2893f97f9889b2","e03513428f4edd5637c890bbab5b28646424f228","2a85b44f44648d5d99b4290bb1c11ce770be9484","01baaa635e852010c5f08eb1041f104be12df23b","564072d587d5c48e9a30e2e7213f896278a51091","8a4adc7dfedccb745dd80dbcdf0d813a8ad1252d","a15b8b14016cac5fd74661c39c9940944fde3a8c","525bc042481604c497296124e1cc17b97fc7dd42","b8dbff42594a6f344b8cc1d30209c3fb6085164a","b9f729b16c89ac017a68253415d634c3d5c443f9","1260648e9baaa50e422a7bbb79443c863e856145","90c3bbbd41dfed18f7ae7ac79aeb870860d94d78","e2367f02b528899ef1aeebaf8e2e23b44fd75cab","bd42e0a31df8e92f30ed7f49695c3a65e190d03a","e165ab95c1fcf05871fe135bdd1a694bb346ffc9","d99910ecf835f8ae6f8b76b9bbdfd69342a25aaa","85a17c4716e0455b8fe9aad98999ee496df8b908","94e60e8ceb952d5b4a905a096fba09ce90c4e17e","e5da8d59654bc9f496c0ab1122f863cd8b1d4285","da534a3d59743cd7e8bfee0ac6cdc2fd9e24450f","dfc31909f3db78bf634f62ed89c356882cf377d6","e1b448181feecef0e4120cc9351ab9d48ca34375","63570346e448fd215bbe8407ba207aab987f3486","2b62b4a0d1e777ded2395f17710c07261abb0be6","80bbe4b1d740f0f158c571d296897597abc107d9","5a4fbb2c070bc9a691c276836ab99ddf63b3c0ec","7602d07f906785f8207e1321f4be07845413493a","0476a2b7a34fc99d18823399744de0f9378000d1"],"title":"Mixed-Effects Models for Conditional Quantiles with Longitudinal Data","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1186"}

Based on this model, we propose a retrospective likelihood approach for genetic linkage analysis using sibship data. This test is an allele-sharing-based test, and does not require specification of genetic models or the penetrance functions. This new approach can incorporate both affected and unaffected sibs, environmental covariates and age of onset or age at censoring information and, therefore, provides a practical solution for mapping genes for complex diseases with variable age of onset. Small simulation study indicates that the proposed method performs better than the commonly used allele-sharing-based methods for linkage analysis, especially when the population disease rate is high. We applied this method to a type 1 diabetes sib pair data set and a small breast cancer data set. Both simulated and real data sets also indicate that the method is relatively robust to the misspecification to the baseline hazard function.","inCitations":["2efac642c76f744a965e991b51f05427e2ad3057","15728b458eaa2ab54d7475131f0902f006ecf8ee","555fc7b27434901ee754b7301895c47a0f735a0d","225e4141b34275fa63b7c34ff1a85ded3516d083","686b754eae7a084b4757c98b5364f4f88a6788c7","c68c978fe3a5b4bfce4efd2691dc7bd0c74f7fdf","4b39b029ce08aacdcadf9d6084431a0c3554892c","97fd816bb7a96c00b5997dea39919ac493e8042e","91e46d7f5488fe7b94b4002917d75d2185d99e27","568de43d6f1a413acbd32ec808aabbd212ee5127","2750e13d21c34def74e3a27bbe6b203ddf756679","a1874b23c97a1a782d8363de0d51bfffb40b8b85","2560aaaa4baf08c30ad006454afd5245e5d609de","b8bfaeaed1495c1161b0180f32d71a5177e429b2","99b9d3af0bdb5a08a78c5128f099b6779cd89d50","de755fc8b76d6efb8a33fa6b9c538d4b9f416fa9","00c88317c44a90e59eacd2929934dcb7daae92d6","13d404396fe4272771a574eeb5c4dfac2fe66a57","cad8332e21cc01daa51d31fd511fd047228709b5","2944c04889e9026dbae26ef37de3ee013aa90b37","85e817985241f5265383d757bdcaf5098aee9a72","978a090220b143a10c683afb18adcd5e76680b7d"],"title":"Multivariate survival models induced by genetic frailties, with application to linkage analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.1.57"}

Zealand.","inCitations":["c91a2659e4e11759ffb9ed128b0090a3b37d8798","0cea7f8d2285b5a65a53ed086fd86bc81cdf2ea5","26ce05cd516212821b80400b877de737444e45a5","8285d91aa9fe7692f0b64715dfc423a49e0543dd","df7ba26de1803bc39d136154918d520018b057c6","e2fe5de3b41701371074671d2d74bab4c161a70a","9606de34329f113264e7959116d0fd55d9d6680d","f92b3827c82a1352102b2a101346d8b8f47421f5","15288b02ae446633e31f7e6b37c28a90f161e526","f16b42eb4280a5ca07aca6e0436fc5f00c3e1da0","4f33fd89ae6aed69f86463f4ab07d9195810195b","9b78d9a0da6a39339472fef82af7593f866060ac","d32cb9c0b6b0b0b501e8c783d4743374ceaa882b","9c604c6e624f537f299626ec063fcf7c41e9b79f","c146226021b3af582b42a6811ced554f337d6dfd","a893a1b5525ce0b0a66a376fe424cb06704a9df8","4087875c34eb066fa48ba1db71a9755b955f3016","5870373d14f79018a28bbdca7c9f243bf48a68cc","6fc1c2badb6b6287906c1cad9911099b54af5c44","cb1ec63726d2d01ee1922e07dc688db1db6d667d","551100784b1c9b3a921477cd0e466843f5256f51","c026bbe9805e6296f1e50463b3a6a00c59fc46b1","fecb3f983d18cc1268715f04153c1ac1bc1d2b08","d42da950771873bdd4caa7da6c27e7ba5cae57fe","9bb0ceda582e111d375c72e872f989810620d373","fc8b836b91b11faf0477a21480c117be6a8001aa","c12e4cebb66b82d093de54764702fd87bca85232","6b7e6bdc3073524bae503d96100ef0849fd68fe3","d1d09fffe5282565b374e4b7efa244ba439595ce","cf39b9b6601d3043ab62edb529406b7114f9fbb9","2b5c20fd84c5a065c4c6e675d2dc5a68c8a0277c","9243ce7da198fac0b2fba50b0c435e5ff57b48f7","508b3b580cbdb50f7a68fd1a5b1fd78bf34c8366","cafe123f950fb4fe8de98cb95fa47f8857dbfebb","7e7e698b62139f5529b5f9fb5f16058cbcec1601","df1a397670d61f53aaee6002d4c1b4e7d2335e76","2ae23338a906fbf014fa6983bd0fd18bccde493b","e4ebafd331da21825b8f021cbc508fdb93ba5095","f779ca336088f99992819b4ca783f80f15776316","f0e5fe80428e7a98cc80af84e80858057bc1b423","066e5bf10165718f849a13120dc72a7ac0cb34b3","2628590c02ae53cf1067f095d11673759b213ba5","d4c04649abe51fc8cd24bdc951c28237f236f417","77974c7e1a7569e37df000bf2b53cf88a999c2bf","45dcadce855316e477f0cdf4639fb2c8aaa80ac7","904b6c45fc95d2778d944dc8b051c4f1bdb50fbd","b66d6d402bd5c015f41731910c5151793ac051a8","9256ca4efc64ea504b81b994b060f7a054cb9bf2","a7d9b2f00a40d3c590e59ccea1b6b97bcbc3b909","312838e6bf147b1a422100061f9a1d84072d8120","c1b479e65aac67fd4f9f05edffadc12ba9f193e0","808181ed6e37395632b46e892355a5037971da86","b8587d96a64e5f683468f3e3cffbe3ff7134bef6","9743cd8e33c535c925f313e5add58898ac99084c","490e326a4866da5e3bf2e7ca6b283e2646dcc0ac","f1bcea0b5f71695ceda796881c2a6a207eea46e3","8859feff6ad5050ec15cda9166444eab70143c63","bf66e6c0a7433633c301afe36e6527410e826fa5","44fa8b8952e5d5f48eb0129affdb9aae0d815946","cee65e31846546b8c8e4b083683538551338a47c","8415c18cd18a1e61c125def02e6850cfa5d3a240","0b8872a2bd5aab210c9597b6fe27b3842774dbdc","ac5fd72a99c4de276b3aeaf320262c3bd6248d4d","7da462a68a50eea76bc49b86d43e766acdf2e8ab","686f90ca436aa9de95a46d5fce9af5267e8291e4","16bc52d4af755f474d3a81ca7c3cff4bb57b6d95","e025de494d4b43226bee3ae559c7b0ce69ef39c5","decd96dad9e9d03c4b9e1c0dacabaccb0224256d","5607a7768fd7731db7041120ab366caaeb74c72c","45458371be6ef0d29d8594ca2f8b352b651cf9c7","3a63dd0e663977de717a755696d15fd245223537","ce0dbf1452d7e018a4be1263caca4cf9f607b120","e6b451971ce43669e9254ab7ff5c037d00afe674","ac45744e65f6cb0dc645011c594b58d673587a91","4c461af8b27fdf6096cb5864fe5553b4382857d8","0236ba27828f002c76419ea63a4177bb6b92053e","48ab4c14f64a5622972df0ee54757997ff7770d0","c6c36278a6ae31d8939ee4a9776b86022ae3c498","5e5e1310916575cb2a48d6972f5de00c2c12235e","09ff0fe0176a32144e936e50b0528730f8a8cf45","81e81426f9a9fb8cc466da048d819745f5b1911d","29f5a39d5cc5924891ec962e0ba3d64bd4dddc33","047d024e9aceb03c994902389a1bb18d67016fb2","17c2f407caab203b69fb405c873745f4f0fd2c79","af87a19f45ed9d8bd15cbc17dae73ea94a317436","cbc82a5b04d31a412b76fcc776652478ecffd378","6f33e3e4b54c0c6aa69a80a40e0950d3afd9d0e1","49f2bdce3478ed39e1b53049d1fc91c2b4cd4438","e8bd89461cb0359cc1482771a51a6e0da57d4b9d","529637e410131749cb4e7444a54eab3227848d60","f4fe6bdfbc6938b3585551463d5372df4e4ec04e","44a35d1d4459b41dddf99135af7fe02598142b62","8cd950932fbd05e9e1059b14c9e5edcdeae9f9f8","f406770d7bfd1869529c5f698ca5750efbd784de","b41fb92239f67e45a90b0ff277f4f213536ea22d","da7f5da2916e53775e632f4792461b07f3100e8a","86cf966810fbeeed1e0adbe26ec88964f5bebc6f","6b9e71b9428cbca26a3d2cab16c5ede3b0f18654","8b255c5ab1567a0ba3cfb02332444cd2da2a68c0","9d32696117346ece79093ba57bd82cb03161fa6e","7b3c053b8d3ca8fe6ac9b5c2ac6f7344a123cf8b","0656b9f7217c427eac8a2329cfa0996623a139e2","6e9183106139968c571cf15361d78522114b32f9","2e364fac7717be5d46c90bf64bec1d87c23d0b00","3f21b9cbb0fd7c50082487704f6baced66e9799a","71fbdce9ed80dcd5aef406856da0db112be18fd4","3eba790d792b856c2811313bf1db3dc8344242a0","b4b24ed6dc3d473d4d1502f2da7dfc0e96737d9b","c9ed45e4616443a8a6150de1b34e966f7a1aa78e","ba0521cf093f2e29b2152634a15e5cc3cb4059b2","ea14c750fce9037292139bc422184a5fe1b0146d","0ece69b60a72d909251aef36ac33ef52e6165a7c","887b55e5e48b8549535575a0648483d2a04e0e8e","8bfbc114f9f0c517ac10e013b5ea1c4329d6ff71","cda58be0ca59cfd3f7496c6bd26a18debc26d964","1c31f9791f1a0f1493a68222092b4

To compare patients' experience with two devices, cross-over studies with patient-reported outcomes (PRO) as response variables are often used. Because of the strength of cross-over designs, each subject can directly compare the two devices by using the PRO variables, and variables indicating preference (preferring A, preferring B, or no preference) can be easily derived. Traditionally, methods based on frequentist statistics can be used to analyze such preference data, but there are some limitations for the frequentist methods. Recently, Bayesian methods are considered an acceptable method by the US Food and Drug Administration to design and analyze device studies. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian statistical method to analyze the data from preference trials. We demonstrate that the new Bayesian estimator enjoys some optimal properties versus the frequentist estimator.","inCitations":["b1be9647ff943e7b23e15155bdda58ef3ac089ab","c708caa2996d039564fee3cb1f1baaa9202aad53","c68be4ae0138b9f5c6e89b98effb62fb42d3e695","058493391b4af9ef2dd2169796984cb1a73b1eef"],"title":"A Bayesian approach to the statistical analysis of device preference studies.","doi":"10.1002/pst.522"}

We compare the Mantel-Haenszel estimator with the one obtained by maximizing profile likelihood in a surrogate augmented setup.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2014,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Interchangeability was originally developed in order to assess drug bioequivalence beyond average bioequivalence. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a Guidance documenting the procedures on using in vivo bioequivalence crossover trial to assess interchangeability between test and reference products. In general, this FDA Guidance describes interchangeability in terms of population and individual bioequivalence. The Guidance procedures were criticized for their lack of sampling distribution of the test statistics. As a result, the critical points were generated from simulation studies without adjusting for sample size. Further more, they lack consistency with average bioequivalence required in the 1992 FDA Guidance. Alternative interchangeability or interchangeability procedures were proposed to measure the probability of individual response difference under two treatments within prespecified lower and upper limits. Interchangeability is claimed if this probability is greater than a prespecified threshold. Tse et al. (2006) proposed an approximate distribution of the estimated probability based on the second-order Taylor expansion. For the same interchangeability probability hypothesis, Liu and Chow (1997) and Tsong and Shen (2007) also proposed a tolerance interval-based approach that can be extended to clinical trials with parallel arm design under the normality assumption. In this article, we first generalized the two-sided tolerance interval based interchangeability without equal sample size and variance assumption. We also derived a power function for the proposed method, and performed simulation studies to compare the type I error rate, power, and sample size between the Tse approximated test and the generalized tolerance interval approach for interchangeability assessment.","inCitations":["3c284f0dc47836d5881c5b62ebe69c2fa4eadbe9","05c4c9fc7e3552b29a732b27fae9db74c10b934c","812a477385d204e9d390271e3d60e71513bc0b4b","8e88bd01be4cf508673d105e2deb33ba74ef1db6"],"title":"Equivalence assessment for interchangeability based on two-sided tests.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.941988"}

Continuing improvements in data acquisition techniques pose constant challenges in applying existing survival analysis methods to these emerging data sets. In this paper, we present tools for fitting regularized Cox survival analysis models on high-dimensional, massive sample-size (HDMSS) data using a variant of the cyclic coordinate descent optimization technique tailored for the sparsity that HDMSS data often present. Experiments on two real data examples demonstrate that efficient analyses of HDMSS data using these tools result in improved predictive performance and calibration.","inCitations":["527889a21fd710a5803867c8dec6c66e7c68e831","5db7af4cdbd758dc97d6b54543f1611374304c17","579dc463cb04309ab3916679e53d6d1eb6189fb8","a488880f2b402b59f10d9acc1b4135dd965c33ca","16d042e210b596a7d44c206bfd12b89763817c20","0be9c023ff77e16ccc25c000249bc13af47aae8e","afdae0e6dbba75d20272efb0422d6d502f72cbcb","d9750a626c59b26598f0eca390ea49127584e66f","3fecafa14273e97f56d3e5a38b3196e5175ed7f1","a3f76897837435d3841cbbe47727b83247906c39","2489e5c0a0497026217c0afd7d7d506c7d5f7afe","7e320cfe1241eca9a1eb0cd0a44c45b3c8a8d4d5","b97317ce3bb18d2946f41aed6d424d0b4b10931a","9241ad38ba3ea94fa0c8d0e68a809c936b9096ec"],"title":"High-dimensional, massive sample-size Cox proportional hazards regression for survival analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt043"}

This proposed tiered approach starts with a criticality determination of quality attributes (QAs) based on risk ranking of their potential impact on product quality and the clinical outcomes. Those QAs characterize biological products in terms of structural, physicochemical, and functional properties. Correspondingly, we propose three tiers of statistical approaches based on the levels of stringency in requirements. The three tiers of statistical approaches will be applied to QAs based on the criticality ranking and other factors. In this article, we discuss the statistical methods applicable to the three tiers of QA. We further provide more details for the proposed equivalence test as the Tier 1 approach. We also provide some discussion on the statistical challenges of the proposed equivalence test in the context of analytical similarity assessment.","inCitations":["218368f21851989193a83dd4ab05cc7fa41056f0","1bedc60ab2b4ef70294a1f40ab2bfedacf88af9a","954bec6a6ba88597dac2746f0dcfa7e3eb525651","00b17200b92771aaa132d2d95165e3e8552e9ba3","a64ca865463c166369b955eb6eaee26f79541c00"],"title":"Development of statistical methods for analytical similarity assessment.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1272606"}

In many applications in education, the total post-test and pre-test scores, ignoring measurement error, are used as response variable and covariate, respectively, to estimate the intervention effect. However, these test scores are frequently subject to measurement error, and statistical inferences based on the model ignoring measurement error can yield a biased estimate of the intervention effect. When multiple domains exist in test data, it is sometimes more informative to detect the intervention effect for each domain than for the entire test. This paper presents applications of the multilevel multidimensional item response model with measurement error adjustments in a response variable and a covariate to estimate the intervention effect for each domain.","inCitations":["bea5e1faaf294b63eeadf3c33ef8eb397b5b0ea1","f3753bb06c21369846f684cd11c5182cc414a00b","a88204759338a90b47267c1801e3258dfd6db2e4"],"title":"Multilevel multidimensional item response model with a multilevel latent covariate.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12051"}
