This paper examines the issue of reporting subscores at an aggregate level, especially at the level of institutions to which the examinees belong. A new statistical approach based on classical test theory is proposed to assess when subscores at the institutional level have any added value over the total scores. The methods are applied to two operational data sets. For the data under study, the observed results provide little support in favour of reporting subscores for either examinees or institutions.","inCitations":["e2fb14def53b3cf30c5e9eea17d429e1a6d5f53c","c12b727835810e0f3ec68b463ee172f09f89f23d","795f0c42972037ea0c7e123b6a77dccfa2442c65","63bf0496322f0f32655dac38d6748c2bec5882db","c85edd0a87d02db381f670a4aa4e66e9162ec608","17975a60bc94a5b4d991f0731bdc5d2563ab8109","fbccaafcbcff0f789afb7612bc2d9055bce173d1","c57742498e19db2ba5430239318913d1bbdf7cf1","e4ec40262a9f5967cb0417d72f205355772f1806","aadadc2a1194d15e275c854b6ffbffda46e2e44c","5b3592e7f0926b135d3181d3ff832b12b3158278","71019417c8c26cf9dbc015d1f94dafcbb195166f","e14f096b315a6da4e0859d50ec25df2c28e0aaac","3e3881b9ebbea6e92eb135af1ca300358b00f275","78f897d635671c5bc5b704b461e62aa37da3a77c","60a3b72efbf592dffa1f073ec5b289e0429a9182","e8c0607d9253fc7af08871ca881cae29a96ac94a","c59d5b11a25431a8031d2532311ea21ab1600bac","4d21cd47190b2a9b5cec699c1ef43cd1f7ca9a5a"],"title":"Reporting subscores for institutions.","doi":"10.1348/000711007X248875"}

The most common approach to testing for bioequivalence is the two one-sided tests procedure. No explicit mathematical formula for the power function in the context of the two one-sided tests procedure exists in the statistical literature, although the exact power based on Owen's special case of bivariate noncentral t-distribution has been tabulated and graphed. Several approximations have previously been published for the probability of rejection in the two one-sided tests procedure for crossover bioequivalence studies. These approximations and associated sample size formulas are reviewed in this article and compared for various parameter combinations with exact power formulas derived here, which are computed analytically as univariate integrals and which have been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. The exact formulas for power and sample size are shown to improve markedly in realistic parameter settings over the previous approximations.","inCitations":["53d50e9c4aca734de1abc4392ceb9aa73b73fd46","00b17200b92771aaa132d2d95165e3e8552e9ba3","f6c46372ff3fa48b653de6d0a63aea46afef1f59","a3587ce13b224c0f7582b2e536d92cf607528cb6","c6d3bcc6e6709891c2d72551e325460ed9b4c51c"],"title":"Exact calculation of power and sample size in bioequivalence studies using two one-sided tests.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1666"}

The paper focuses on a class of optimization criteria arising in clinical trials with several competing goals, termed tradeoff-based optimization criteria, and discusses key considerations in constructing and applying tradeoff-based criteria. The clinical trial optimization framework considered in the paper is illustrated using two case studies based on a clinical trial with multiple objectives and a two-stage clinical trial which utilizes adaptive decision rules.","inCitations":["23d50b35865a7065e2861329a8605f9064f73112","5981f54f3279085141fbc523fa365c2190e0ac82"],"title":"Tradeoff-based optimization criteria in clinical trials with multiple objectives and adaptive designs.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1092032"}

One key feature of the model is the combination of propensity score matching to balance confounding variables between the two living arrangement groups -in order to reduce bias due to unbalanced covariates at baseline, with a pattern mixture model for longitudinal data -in order to deal with non-ignorable drop-out. A fully Bayesian approach allows us to convey the uncertainty in the estimation of the propensity score and subsequent matching in the inference of the causal effect of interest. The analysis conducted here adds to previous studies in the literature concerning the protective effect of living with someone, by proposing a modeling approach treating living arrangement as an exposure.","inCitations":["8bbfa5f2ada566e51e0b1f4b763f92096ed7a785","566deedfd2e1ccb651200ca6ee27e6836bab9261","fb81ca3e0d7a8dfdbcb6b023fadfc9d2b2fd0468","38a378b9b8d46921f36d9eacf73b8c416703b984","40f186300b05823dbd2b3f8aafbf2e41ca3aa375","dc6a14a107a2536064479014c6366d9703cedc55","568d83284c4797ce227241afc424fb2d2f8d7db3"],"title":"Causal inference with longitudinal outcomes and non-ignorable drop-out: Estimating the effect of living alone on cognitive decline.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12110"}

Many phase I dose-finding methods based solely on toxicity considerations have been proposed under the assumption that both toxicity and efficacy monotonically increase with the dose level. Such an assumption may not be necessarily the case, however, when evaluating the OD for molecular targeted, cytostatic, and biological agents, as well as immune-oncology therapy. To address this issue, we extend the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design, which is nonparametric and thus does not require the assumption used in model-based designs, in order to identify an OD based on both efficacy and toxicity outcomes. The new design is named \"BOIN-ET.\" A simulation study is presented that includes a comparison of this proposed method to the model-based approaches in terms of both efficacy and toxicity responses. The simulation shows that BOIN-ET has advantages in both the percentages of correct ODs selected and the average number of patients allocated to the ODs across a variety of realistic settings.","inCitations":["c10b8c4e92404fd94063db38bf2e51b1b9e6e878","23515392ad092e3f1d5d5c564f99387ee03353bb","0f8c6e826de02061eddaf93d7fb85a3462e7da7f"],"title":"BOIN-ET: Bayesian optimal interval design for dose finding based on both efficacy and toxicity outcomes.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1864"}

When these variables are simultaneously screened by a statistical test, it is necessary to consider the adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing. The false discovery rate has been proposed and widely used to address this issue. A related problem is the estimation of the proportion of true null hypotheses. The long-standing difficulty to this problem is the identifiability of the nonparametric model. In this study, we propose a moment-based method coupled with sample splitting for estimating this proportion. If the p values from the alternative hypothesis are homogeneously distributed, then the proposed method will solve the identifiability and give its optimal performances. When the p values from the alternative hypothesis are heterogeneously distributed, we propose to approximate this mixture distribution so that the identifiability can be achieved. Theoretical aspects of the approximation error are discussed. The proposed estimation method is completely nonparametric and simple with an explicit formula. Simulation studies show the favorable performances of the proposed method when it is compared to the other existing methods. Two microarray gene expression data sets are considered for applications.","inCitations":["289355a54eee1fad98471f32105823cb059a5b76","96401004ad3ab64af3482d575ae25598913f5ce3","f6a2a45e6de0a8d29810bb749d1c48cc5bb63a18","1b401062762e6d39a7d05cbeecb621eb28dd2cc5","b3f7d74986afb92b26139520754b44c724e11783","39bb8926f6547093c75fdf7f7cb8118d39e510a0","8a2a09ef11ef10e20e2cbe0610390e6cdf6a9a1c","a3177c344129298455445edb7902d40cd9dd3bc1","522a22f15190643e99bdd4a14357665443216260","424f2627bc0c4bee7a5b54f63797a419163f72e1","b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c","c21dde7f60fd7424d1252691bd922b1e81328cd4","b66f88aa0454a1f7c1d1ebb7209cee3baec1b175","84e034ebd3d51ad7a43b9ee7a05bdf9ddcee7564"],"title":"A moment-based method for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses and its application to microarray gene expression data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm002"}

Established approaches should be considered limited, however, because posterior estimation either requires prespecification of a shrinkage weight for each source or relies on the data to inform a single parameter, which determines the extent of influence or shrinkage from all sources, risking considerable bias or minimal borrowing. We introduce multisource exchangeability models (MEMs), a general Bayesian approach for integrating multiple, potentially non‐exchangeable, supplemental data sources into the analysis of a primary data source. Our proposed modeling framework yields source‐specific smoothing parameters that can be estimated in the presence of the data to facilitate a dynamic multi‐resolution smoothed estimator that is asymptotically consistent while reducing the dimensionality of the prior space. When compared with competing Bayesian hierarchical modeling strategies, we demonstrate that MEMs achieve approximately 2.2 times larger median effective supplemental sample size when the supplemental data sources are exchangeable as well as a 56% reduction in bias when there is heterogeneity among the supplemental sources. We illustrate the application of MEMs using a recently completed randomized trial of very low nicotine content cigarettes, which resulted in a 30% improvement in efficiency compared with the standard analysis.","inCitations":["f2d44160f14a96afb5fe021beda62b97b073daa6","a898acc2de378fb47650c7793361c919f1765c6b","2fa7be1a8cc76e291b50862a9470b4bbb503200d","add3331713845ce1065a83358633441b74315718","db1d99ce84f63343a6b30d5971b14ce313010473","b95685d9d28110e1c6782d15bcbe54f32dec58db"],"title":"Bayesian hierarchical modeling based on multisource exchangeability","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx031"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2016,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Electronic journal of statistics","paperAbstract":"Various forms of penalty functions have been developed for regularized estimation and variable selection. Screening approaches are often used to reduce the number of covariate before penalized estimation. However, in certain problems, the number of covariates remains large after screening. For example, in genome-wide association (GWA) studies, the purpose is to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with certain traits, and typically there are millions of SNPs and thousands of samples. Because of the strong correlation of nearby SNPs, screening can only reduce the number of SNPs from millions to tens of thousands and the variable selection problem remains very challenging. Several penalty functions have been proposed for such high dimensional data. However, it is unclear which class of penalty functions is the appropriate choice for a particular application. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis to relate the ranges of tuning parameters of various penalty functions with the dimensionality of the problem and the minimum effect size. We exemplify our theoretical results in several penalty functions. The results suggest that a class of penalty functions that bridges L0 and L1 penalties requires less restrictive conditions on dimensionality and minimum effect sizes in order to attain the two fundamental goals of penalized estimation: to penalize all the noise to be zero and to obtain unbiased estimation of the true signals. The penalties such as SICA and Log belong to this class, but they have not been used often in applications. The simulation and real data analysis using GWAS data suggest the promising applicability of such class of penalties.","inCitations":["19845f57a4b4b983bf6e92735b0971f5b09ca4af","e386fc0aac85bf7d78a24c978007493f6570909c","3c5e78f065bdbdab9fe202e8f2a1dcdf74958167","6cce9c3ce3b8e98d3e93ec884d0908333f96484b"],"title":"Designing penalty functions in high dimensional problems: The role of tuning parameters.","doi":"10.1214/16-EJS1169"}

In order to reliably compare gene expression levels between and within arrays, it is necessary to remove systematic errors that distort the biological signal of interest. The standard for accomplishing this is smoothing \"MA-plots\" to remove intensity-dependent dye bias and array-specific effects. However, MA methods require strong assumptions, which limit their general applicability. We review these assumptions and derive several practical scenarios in which they fail. The \"dye-swap\" normalization method has been much less frequently used because it requires two arrays per pair of samples. We show that a dye-swap is accurate under general assumptions, even under intensity-dependent dye bias, and that a dye-swap removes dye bias from a single pair of samples in general. Based on a flexible model of the relationship between mRNA amount and single-channel fluorescence intensity, we demonstrate the general applicability of a dye-swap approach. We then propose a common array dye-swap (CADS) method for the normalization of two-channel microarrays. We show that CADS removes both dye bias and array-specific effects, and preserves the true differential expression signal for every gene under the assumptions of the model.","inCitations":["dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d","0e488c5fc19b8a80402272175529112de3ef6b2e","ceee5dde1814f3e30e041750c1d3a669e7092539","b6e6ebfa6419a6744c0da91485c2bfe9e4fb6de1","99a9bded32591a98e5ec4da89ec992b202d61068","e3d4c08cf41be5bb88c7be48c31c15a243b41fb8","d889cb9fa00d253adcd8e5af9da944b217905122","abe58bc0b0e59f1bd5869bd4ce2269259921fa60","6403b36d5d90256d2a47ef961b50a218336fe30f","040384ea1537a9d714b8639774054082c758810d","0bffd3e137aecc3894faae8cf64049459b04089c","11633e5e99664c7758a99b532075d7bf99a965a7","b9e1271c01270be20ee99317f3832c0763f3ee32","e0acea17ee7c64436ed68deb467a40210cc2bd03","8d220501328503b9ab4ebd1077e40bbe8836688d","9c1d62d1509ee146ddd06e8c7c9af3a9cacd8d35","d616814a50af4e079fe43a6fac545ea37545a0a0","ab03c052eab0c4a3753f130d119bc5ad23adf32d","d327d42b27a1dca044236762bf3e29bfc2ebd7aa","d1f309885e9117c2aea3f795f657534eb294dfaa","59f33ccc069b5c9553684b2234176c73444b936e","655a7ab7c8ffd3259b80369bcac79c82d81cedcd","72392546d65eeb145c671b2cd4057216553af73a","54e77de486658c0579dd95367f0154e6eb0d1059"],"title":"A new approach to intensity-dependent normalization of two-channel microarrays.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj038"}

The main contribution of this paper is establishment of a connection between tree data spaces and the well developed area of Functional Data Analysis (FDA), where the data objects are curves. This connection comes through two tree representation approaches, the Dyck path representation and the branch length representation. These representations of trees in Euclidean spaces enable us to exploit the power of FDA to explore statistical properties of tree data objects. A major challenge in the analysis is the sparsity of tree branches in a sample of trees. We overcome this issue by using a tree pruning technique that focuses the analysis on important underlying population structures. This method parallels scale-space analysis in the sense that it reveals statistical properties of tree structured data over a range of scales. The effectiveness of these new approaches is demonstrated by some novel results obtained in the analysis of brain artery trees. The scale space analysis reveals a deeper relationship between structure and age. These methods are the first to find a statistically significant gender difference.","inCitations":["0f63b4532de1cf8a240a6d7218293f575f6e2ac8","df0b2eb106405ce5404de1515eb4ea4b6d5fb8e7","1faa6fc987458d3114d06cc950bba8db599715fe","dcd7c794c001f71a4737b4c553f57599f0635605","c9f99fc1638e854beb0ce1d95dd114db1db8729e","c92b6db56fa82fa666593a07419b8bc30030e3f2","c7ba47eacc72d720d7a22efa2fcd71d5f547de2d","86eaef6e177af043cb8820a681c4bd5a17f7a9e2","0ed1f34e5fd1a39c08a1ef478ddc774c1f4bdd8d","865a81d5a96cee6fb4b44f1a817cd095aff521f5","b38e73ddcb006f1987bdfc7e917eea08ed1d2627","ed807a3b51bdc5c2cb7054da18b86519fa542297","f8cd69ec01ff285cc4ff0fe8df7dc12defeea7ff","b2cd96beec70537546d5c6fcb0f6b7911446d278","6f9ce1d120a98f025f5eef083b8ce3244a941d67","e0df56129f81527cf0b6c4dee1e7e09223277e56","c466e986c3767e17b267e0d243c9e620ae653e9a","869263162d6dde4a56c8688ebbffa41a47fe3b6e","d4ccbe1d5dab07f8b9568e1041b98ad5e9fe9168"],"title":"Functional Data Analysis of Tree Data Objects.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2013.786943"}

Two kinds of stimuli were used; intervals consisting of two simultaneous simple tones (sinusoids) and intervals consisting of two simultaneous complex tones (funda­ mental plus harmonics). Subjects judged the stimuli by the method of triadic comparisons in an incomplete balanced design. Multidimensional analysis was performed according to Kruskal's MDSCAL program. The following results were obtained: (a) In both the space of simple-tone intervals (S) and the space of complex-tone intervals (C) musical intervals are ordered according to their width (frequency difference between fundamental tones). This ordering appears to follow a scale which is bowed upwards in the centre; extremely narrow and extremely wide intervals are therefore more similar than would be expected on the basis of their width alone, (b) In addition, the intervals in C are ordered along a dimension which is related to the complexity of the frequency ratio of the fundamental tones. This is much less true for S. (c) In S, on the other hand, intervals are differentiated on a dimension which is interpreted as indicating their resemblance to certain normative reference intervals. Attention is given to a number of methodologica l issues.","inCitations":["86dea58623ecf3854cfeeff1e06e22b3336ba88a","2d54a3967d8233ba4b25bca52ea493112ebead71","71e95bb26a2eadf84317ace36a64a165e125c9cd","ac60df8d46d5658ad7c47625476734ce58b60237","b8d16d3bcbd3e64c825d3dea94d718485fa51f1c","bfe25da0d2933ba77859991354422088ffaf3f16","f3700d63db67f6c9abadc01cd852c9a461d727d0","64ea095d1eb5a114479a8ff6def0e2d9e9652225","2542d84d7d0b2812c61fd1283b152ffe51ae4403","c7e4134985c9cc03e41c627d768cf9777ebcd0e9","93b75aaf938371cc59af9b67372c98b5ffb6e0e1","4c11251f25c0a9ee6b1093b35c3b35fad8371c26","ea2d64556145d8b39cd83389fd9361a7116e6d9c","a1c0abfd749426179414481e58e49ee59a8de5f6","2f8ff1f159b15cac54aea8b6e7037ab8a71c5b22","d7483c6761a3c1bea8b9d5a8aea0137e8702256c","90a40aed3f30f66b9d86be61d5163da0f9cce795","6650afeb6148d186cc9d39243583679442b943ac","b28d9025469dba2c05860bc2d842c64db1a7661e","aa8ca0d0861eaab4ccc344102bcb6a84cd285eb7","04d0daf15e6bd3b8b20d96513698d327584ace04","87da20e5b1f6e367878625ee8aeb70e131b20270","289ea915efdb3f4718acdf148fff124a3650d79b","4c861f7522e7f11dd3aff89698c0eb3bf5799502","667fda63780ead4101b31a22ff9be0321524fddf","81ba832204450c0a77d5946f769949a3ebddb210","cdea4dd030b0328a967979308dc8d64b9d802b27","9d1e4c6f09263909284908ace46845ab999b6b97","1f742d86a3030d9b8460a3c4b942540cce3f77f2","4d7bb8b6c552164547f34aa9586beba182d4cfa4","e48b02a243323c9be4c90efaee7761b5cba824cd","f080a5d844826705e1c6c39c9e08168fb4dfbab9","d5ee1e466d6f93d52ee6fe305e4705dd8f3ca6d7","6756320e2f8002394b6904ad362bcdacd344ea1c","cb27d611c130bb067ac79e3ae4943a5e6eabdd44","92084fa819299396da2316d4dab0e82c3d92e5f0","48eaaece47c14af1a5a99e2182bc85ee452bb842"],"title":"Triadic comparisons of musical intervals.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1966.tb00366.x"}

Recent high-throughput technologies have a resolution that permits the detection of segmental changes in DNA copy number that span thousands of base pairs in the genome. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) may simultaneously screen for copy number phenotype and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) phenotype associations as part of the analytic strategy. However, genomewide array analyses are particularly susceptible to batch effects as the logistics of preparing DNA and processing thousands of arrays often involves multiple laboratories and technicians, or changes over calendar time to the reagents and laboratory equipment. Failure to adjust for batch effects can lead to incorrect inference and requires inefficient post hoc quality control procedures to exclude regions that are associated with batch. Our work extends previous model-based approaches for copy number estimation by explicitly modeling batch and using shrinkage to improve locus-specific estimates of copy number uncertainty. Key features of this approach include the use of biallelic genotype calls from experimental data to estimate batch-specific and locus-specific parameters of background and signal without the requirement of training data. We illustrate these ideas using a study of bipolar disease and a study of chromosome 21 trisomy. The former has batch effects that dominate much of the observed variation in the quantile-normalized intensities, while the latter illustrates the robustness of our approach to a data set in which approximately 27% of the samples have altered copy number. Locus-specific estimates of copy number can be plotted on the copy number scale to investigate mosaicism and guide the choice of appropriate downstream approaches for smoothing the copy number as a function of physical position.

Most commonly, it is used under the assumption that data is normally distributed. This assumption, however, does not apply to skewed data sets. While methods for the estimation of the CCC of skewed data sets have been introduced and studied, the Bayesian approach and its comparison with the previous methods has been lacking. In this study, we propose a Bayesian method for the estimation of the CCC of skewed data sets and compare it with the best method previously investigated. The proposed method has certain advantages. It tends to outperform the best method studied before when the variation of the data is mainly from the random subject effect instead of error. Furthermore, it allows for greater flexibility in application by enabling incorporation of missing data, confounding covariates, and replications, which was not considered previously. The superiority of this new approach is demonstrated using simulation as well as real-life biomarker data sets used in an electroencephalography clinical study. The implementation of the Bayesian method is accessible through the Comprehensive R Archive Network.","inCitations":["0c2d407e75a7ea25c677e54168d85ac79997e9a0","ddfc9e436a219112a832f7ed9183ce4cf72dfc9c"],"title":"A Bayesian estimate of the concordance correlation coefficient with skewed data.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1692"}

In contrast, the literature has paid relatively less attention to sample size estimation for studies with multiarm repeated measurements where the design and data analysis can be more complex than two-arm trials. For continuous outcomes, Jung & Ahn (2004) and Zhang & Ahn (2013) have presented sample size formulas to compare the rates of change and time-averaged responses in multi-arm trials, using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. To our knowledge, there has been no corresponding development for multi-arm trials with count outcomes. We present a sample size formula for comparing the rates of change in multi-arm repeated count outcomes using the GEE approach that accommodates various correlation structures, missing data patterns, and unbalanced designs. We conduct simulation studies to assess the performance of the proposed sample size formula under a wide range of designing configurations. Simulation results suggest that empirical type I error and power are maintained close to their nominal levels. The proposed method is illustrated using an epileptic clinical trial example.","inCitations":["7e5e4bcf209423829129e1ee2f09ee483481e995"],"title":"Sample Size Estimation for Comparing Rates of Change in K-group Repeated Count Outcomes.","doi":"10.1080/03610926.2016.1260744"}

We suggest a general computation strategy for estimating nonparametric functions. We also employ the penalized spline method for partially linear models and conduct intensive simulation experiments to explore the numerical performance of the penalized spline method, profile and backfitting methods.

In each situation, interpretation and analysis are made easier if the items are ordered by difficulty in the same way for every individual taking the test, i.e. the item response functions do not cross. This is an invariant item ordering. In this paper we review a class of non-parametric unidimensional item response models in which the ordinal properties of items (and persons) can be studied, and survey both old and new methods for the investigation of invariant item ordering in empirical data sets. Our model formulation derives in particular from the work of Holland & Rosenbaum (1986), Junker (1993) and Mokken (1971). We survey methods based on the work of Mokken (1971), Rosenbaum (1987a, b), and Sijtsma & Meijer (1992), and we also discuss some new proposals for checking invariant item ordering. When violations are detected, these methods allow a rough assessment of where on the latent scale the item response functions cross. We also study similarities and differences between these various methods and provide guidelines for their use. Finally, the methods are illustrated with data from a developmental psychology experiment in which the ability to draw inferences about transitive relations is explored.","inCitations":["c3b0221de21ce7a521e49ec27b4a84a9e86f3075","de18422f114eb02eb2eb90cacf873e4cd4c42aa6","605e5abf3ec243a7c45a066fd52885b848a584f5","cd45fa7b672044110802a01d8b16f8c721e426a3","c822a1577929c9128b61070ad9e6c748bb4a4cf4","8367eda507e6ef56e8bd5aa61b25f6615eaa63d3","8c0765ce0db424d663df425105e3c97896fa1c65","aecf8edf0c08dd99ab1fa4a354773b3a875bee4f","395ec3425a64a3a29b27b703c64ce3165d74b172","1f8c864d97f34b06bdd20b6ac3299fb069337326","d77284d361d330eafc99687ff6abf1a8ebddaed8","59eddb57c6a8e67b8da638797d7854d6b0bd4b61","d9c3a1f3c17fd01a048aae4c7b351c135cb96189","3ab2b5f63383e02a4d610c10bc531c364f683e9d","15df3840ce14344ab56e6e0f6b81a2543f689d4e","c4ad7ddabef0269e7ce1fd05c9af1f8dc3c1624e","633ce1eed16dee48d010105f0c1f899233a1c710","ac207cfbd179f5b59e0f64a4f7f0b8133cc546f1","efee283127b69fc51ba9cd364900067534e272de","3487c7eded70b83be56c159413bcfb4774b192a8","7a6ad807b789356066c61b390fbd86f6a44f043b","2706040edd1b3553a0a3d985e950c6fe49b20c06","98316ea226c975ed3ccdb5d8892540c84d40474e","3d2efd3f3fb6cef0eb1883f23255d28441457cdf","58591ea124ec38224f34851c671792436c8b24e7","27e5a7e5d5096aa2477f4b682017f371c35baa1d","9fe18d81f865bd104ae2105fa5fb692a4b1a005f","538640dfc3d893e34ab213d4d7451483a61eb1fb","49c4f26f92dc63bea6f920f20ded5a33e81bdb97","1f3c6281e197db878ad7a480a05b93badd25ac24","d1bf73c848345261b7364b0f92799ec766751d21","efa9993577b16e622a3e79a2789958e2e4259fb5","a35a1e4812f1436bf264484853a8d0c1a0244cee","e92efc3b1cf0d48f8019f080f368e399740a040b","c9b9fac19cf5d7ab6f0d46262e7950e6f48be708","226123d210c3651e7699df5acc39a70e9456d5c4","d92da758897e02d638900266a5ec130f2b478dec","fba14969839de26a20f2f9b15dfa447c1849153e","6897bc55553bb1e483df84aee460e6a823aba25e","245fc9b208a10f9416c4d1a7415b2fce70c0dbd5","b879608db645eebf91e8ffcbe069c739f899bfea","c96b102bbdcbeb9f7a06bb93c1e0a904a1344c05","1340eb4217160b549cc4c58ff454482b5cd6029b","1ffab5bab6d35bea6c1acaaf68e5cebfcacb9956","88d516e1f1c52c53ab8c2c1266a9d6063a1caa71","349f1e9f4bd59ee101232449c9393fcf19b7de84","cbc07ee765b54b5f4999354c90a1334e1f5b1a1b","cff3f4d78730cd009791ac7f6aa1895016d50623","f1f637a65800278560acb9aa3c3ec4e1c4c2c9ce","f5dc157e67dd88b398ca39f55a128cc3516c6643","7423d0474efc6ff4247f8d6b10396a75e94e1dbc","102a29fac28f6e8c3c11d5c954902f620a85b01f","8c0cbfb6dbb1c524de029f0bbce34f319e6ab182","d4cc2afd4ae8bbd5db8f930e88178be64242600c","84aa1354cb71bc787fcbb5fe26dc0bb558ef7e06"],"title":"A survey of theory and methods of invariant item ordering.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1996.tb01076.x"}
