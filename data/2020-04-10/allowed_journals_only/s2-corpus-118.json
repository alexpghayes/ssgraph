Given a longitudinal data structure observed on a sample of n independent and identically distributed experimental units, MSM model the counterfactual outcome distribution corresponding with a static treatment intervention, conditional on user-supplied baseline covariates. Identification of a static treatment regimen-specific outcome distribution based on observational data requires, beyond the standard sequential randomization assumption, the assumption that each experimental unit has positive probability of following the static treatment regimen. The latter assumption is called the experimental treatment assignment (ETA) assumption, and is parameter-specific. In many studies the ETA is violated because some of the static treatment interventions to be compared cannot be followed by all experimental units, due either to baseline characteristics or to the occurrence of certain events over time. For example, the development of adverse effects or contraindications can force a subject to stop an assigned treatment regimen.In this article we propose causal effect models for a user-supplied set of realistic individualized treatment rules. Realistic individualized treatment rules are defined as treatment rules which always map into the set of possible treatment options. Thus, causal effect models for realistic treatment rules do not rely on the ETA assumption and are fully identifiable from the data. Further, these models can be chosen to generalize marginal structural models for static treatment interventions. The estimating function methodology of Robins and Rotnitzky (1992) (analogue to its application in Murphy, et. al. (2001) for a single treatment rule) provides us with the corresponding locally efficient double robust inverse probability of treatment weighted estimator.In addition, we define causal effect models for intention-to-treat regimens. The proposed intention-to-treat interventions enforce a static intervention until the time point at which the next treatment does not belong to the set of possible treatment options, at which point the intervention is stopped. We provide locally efficient estimators of such intention-to-treat causal effects.","inCitations":["9209ba418e073da038cea4ce9090e3d7d0bd769a","02d7edf1af0ac11d3ee94e25b839a4c956d4c58e","b26be44b7e9c49615a33fe6f7d32faca2cd8e49c","42e4451cf75ee3f2da952538cba07f9e181d633f","378acef2626b1b1dc1dc806f14bf534ecbacec60","cea5a78f75446bfda4128fa588cea52d9fff3fe4","27c6d95ab651a15ce916d6a1f42201f746def051","856e5aea41ea550ed6c577291856d4557b30b633","5ea8f173e45c912e475b68e31159c293df8c3e95","2ce76d7623055a844ce4d9ded653a63d0a9c9447","fb3bc1d6f74256e10a09fc0cff260593303e4c06","833aa056a64a612fa5f7b7781d29db34a3e9a777","407a22876ac2a0e1b8a7764fd12a669c4c313c81","2854de412a740453ecc6999fcec6a91936bf13fe","9e4b91edb7ef1c03148f2a587ce4949581e9b477","2d65a44e3e89836daae7950125b0f1ab31198b78","10ec5f67261e156a69444b3845f56d521edf7ba6","1c27c6016cbc706b99b8efe32d8aa02678bccb54","d5d3fcf1d89f03edab75d274620efd623fc07ea5","09bc263568c5437ba03e8acf6193714aaa22fb64","2e8da638ae14f74845629ee1c2661b9731006966","72d60971785685a44c2de55ede3a3f830d923e27","db5043638485d7203aec46bd367fda6fcfdb0f3f","9f6a7c3d65e159f6f8cdde1aead27f03e726ce9b","a1153519fdd6a696958dffc8b7a8b817e53bdcce","89a9f10a089555b5a91619cc7e863c7952bec1d0","99f0066af00e2d5e27127133f87383ce26d89864","7d9969e2cf64c731f0a5a857e5e219d828e961ed","e1cad477d89724410abbfc9624299df9fa91c686","a2cc5da9a16a9460a43644d642e436f360c6a392","d9717c53d893c435be06205f0893cf9dae78b04c","fc41ac21596f8d2da1214f9c0fca9f4942639340","b0b2c40e5689c5e0f6cf234d2ad48c6151da2efc","e5d164890b6930256f84639be76ba0b4807169d4","eba82e05120159fb6d1ee9b214e8ad3f2cfa65e0","b634bfa3f51c69ecadf627a316aded489d460067","9ae35d2d35d5399c158f1acf3704638f65331464","49ff23bf9908cf101b16700b7efe14164011eadb","f1232b518ae4b7f05647e68e5db69a753c55eb3c","9151d84629277bab26148bdb6379626b44e1cd0a","5eecd1a9922bd9233fbf0b025a86ef8c5e4e1b65","d29380842a0f0325832f43a416f4226231809cb2","afd9cc8b618d998e92e9d5bb2b18db2aa9050ffa","6188270aacef2f08bad71639783f3ef7b1407ad1","ef4c7472cc62426462b4bf938d1ade706f6582fb","209928f2019676a868b7f0becd4da023e77a086c","759b00cf35b397eab468935b5d90d04e9ed25549","870ba014a1fe5884e4495dd4c2f7733485b5ada7","5b00c26576f45320f009aa8f5e5b8dc553a179c2","1b94a2cbeb324055f42c2a801844417cbb73fa6d","97ce1e46e3df1febd847e3bda06014ea1033c4d2","ef93d9cb099adf706de21e5f83bd48e23d2099ab","764b113c9b04d2c10a2494db8d3bfa6885d97860","7d416d8b6201af8c06e05aa74f7a4ea5f4cdba83","c6706c9084e870737fc415555c529c29bc5e188f","a58005780902eda807118fe130a43fc924d2a2d9","858992ee0d559835a1fa9912e8cc76aaec49e4e1","620af58eaa251370cc07b6c954716da22e84a12e","4903bc7210ed733bbfbe9c4e222f8914a0f62675","ffb124fa7295e66e7991b7438b900b8fb24f0124","e41e75f4525e958bbf13b300b8ba41a4fa4e34ee","90a1973e41d7d8fdc1cc083c930f823e9e80882c","bc65f1fbf0ac429ffa1104cd8e026df861167331","a5a341eebc045665dd5eb7abaa5c5cc34992404d","2996e6ca65c6b509cff525f84f57e3964a65b6ae","cc6862d6d2f952b02b6b9cf18aa56ec131c9c227","9d8d43bc497d5f1e50a1a1b46df7e3b558b7604e","fe88ecf240782077d68d21cdbf2a78673e6a0e7a","2edc363b9b5ac16c7eac6e57950c8ad8bbb95cd6","fd63cae6559b98cf49e2c493d1b4aa5473eaa693","91a7943b130a5b108f43e12758ca1341e5c3a670","53586db3da5eaf80526965192e87e0f56f19630c","0eaa526ef29c6644d97c7628cfe8a37a72e69fdb","923181f074894638dba11dc1715a5953b7888d09","2fe4b965827630c76dd1208547c89d4c8c4b1b63","71b5b5786f63e90535470ab8262a60bb5f60eefc","3dda09003d822f2ec07e2d82ffd48c97c61452b0","e96d06351525051f6df82dd7ab3c17cc9e08b4c8","2beef38f5a3b7a2fd52e64d2b5a7f7cebc5479b4","e568a265747151e23e6db7ae64437dd854385fcb"],"title":"Causal Effect Models for Realistic Individualized Treatment and Intention to Treat Rules","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1022"}

Noncompliance by some subjects with their assigned treatment poses a challenge to the data analyst. The principal stratification framework permits inference about causal effects among subpopulations characterized by potential compliance. However, in the absence of prior information, there are 2 significant limitations: (1) the causal effects cannot be point identified for some strata and (2) individuals in the subpopulations (strata) cannot be identified. We propose to use additional information-compliance-predictive covariates-to help identify the causal effects and to help describe characteristics of the subpopulations. The probability of membership in each principal stratum is modeled as a function of these covariates. The model is constructed using marginal compliance models (which are identified) and a sensitivity parameter that captures the association between the 2 marginal distributions. We illustrate our methods in both a simulation study and an analysis of data from a smoking cessation trial.","inCitations":["0842afc925bd431cab85f73cb73ec66279a39e0c","8778a20c52a8146490b6e5ca8df69e1143dbd68b","9b7de019d6ae1914fb8631a99a6de209eb8c0d23","9c9ce8f34016ffb422cec215c70dab1ebd0b3554","1bef9ff36e9e33742b8751c8e244efdf32f28c1b","33585bb8106967332c464cf1eaaf23bdbde7ef55","30e575fbce864be687822f79a983031fe80969ae","e188a200c48b63d12fff4e580bfea04963ba763b","4d547cfbb0173f64dbdcfaab2fd8aa383f0d56fa","a97a6ad64e20f1fd0a636c1c2d3eeaff1013be57","e9eaae7f50632e044bfd0e6809d3b82bdfd4afda","9c0d4280ebb79a1283fe4c1dbbbea0b0f6d361e5","c9c1183a3bbbddf2b5b4d0dd81b8b2ddb728eebc","e231e698e024a19ce0daf5ff9550196eba58ba22","a2530552a5f5d216ff7357e12a6298fd3f41ec12","2a34062b8775d401ec9f1243ea82136d4b4373bd","717efef7202b5f0246bd872facfc40d7c191ea8d","305c1929f9b5cd60aede21b30b7f6fb65b31dbd3","14d1ddc8b3ff7c5821a6604dfb8e032f6899e794","099255bff15a8074f367b4d091f0ecb23c129329","4467ef17978e9166493c917e0df280fc3864d49d","dfd2ea644b94b5667423e4a6b73593ce47076af5","a68170a5e4fb11abfb645aded45795a0930f87be","258ab96e90f2356ed0ab6a2e2c3fb05982acac33","d58823a4e48073a1f45998689862ae7e732fbb21","cb9227ac8b864adbec32b94e8fbd22c0b8282014","46596b57af63696a1714f8ec515e360708ee9905","54acf3a3c239db81c41723b528d2baa513aa8ce9","81a10af6d1cd17ed65976603e916593950ab439f"],"title":"Principal stratification with predictors of compliance for randomized trials with 2 active treatments.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm027"}

The independence assumption implies that the number of false rejections V follows a binomial distribution and leads to an estimator of the empirical false discovery rate (eFDR). The number of false rejections V is modeled with the beta-binomial distribution. An estimator of the beta-binomial false discovery rate (bbFDR) is then derived. This approach accounts for how the correlation among non-differentially expressed genes influences the distribution of V. Permutations are used to generate the observed values for V under the null hypotheses and a beta-binomial distribution is fit to the values of V. The bbFDR estimator is compared to the eFDR estimator in simulation studies of correlated non-differentially expressed genes and is found to outperform the eFDR for certain scenarios. As an example, this method is also used to perform an analysis that compares the gene expression of soft tissue sarcoma samples to normal tissue samples.","inCitations":["9339111f4c1f4df1230d7e866e7df9b1d05dd02c","7fcdba6190c0873b11c1ff80e7482bf345011b39","6593aebe761bb0439343638735f5ac8cd0ae5cc0","b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c","bb205f0c917f3eb3ee6ea4b323ea34372b245d80","2ac47521a557a8fe3773b736ebb7797b9e485d42","1a7ee7b3f6f019a9ae13ef7165968f32e82435ff","c068a50eb6d1d5df437a825df57a512d608cce69"],"title":"The beta-binomial distribution for estimating the number of false rejections in microarray gene expression studies","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.01.013"}

A mean-square error weighted estimator is considered here; its performance is thoroughly investigated via Simon's optimal and minimax designs and Shuster's design. Compared with the sample proportion, the proposed method has a smaller bias, and compared with the maximum likelihood estimator, the proposed method has a smaller mean-square error.","inCitations":["6a702a9c401b72c71f3f0795b099dca868ee6b5f","8c9b9fbde17c6ce9bd56a54d7e059a18da4c6276","ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb"],"title":"An MSE-reduced estimator for the response proportion in a two-stage clinical trial.","doi":"10.1002/pst.414"}

We propose an approach to describe change over time of the latent process underlying multiple longitudinal outcomes of different types (binary, ordinal, quantitative). By relying on random-effect models, this approach handles individually varying and outcome-specific measurement times. A linear mixed model describes the latent process trajectory while equations of observation combine outcome-specific threshold models for binary or ordinal outcomes and models based on flexible parameterized non-linear families of transformations for Gaussian and non-Gaussian quantitative outcomes. As models assuming continuous distributions may be also used with discrete outcomes, we propose likelihood and information criteria for discrete data to compare the goodness of fit of models assuming either a continuous or a discrete distribution for discrete data. Two analyses of the repeated measures of the Mini-Mental State Examination, a 20-item psychometric test, illustrate the method. First, we highlight the usefulness of parameterized non-linear transformations by comparing different flexible families of transformation for modelling the test as a sum score. Then, change over time of the latent construct underlying directly the 20 items is described using two-parameter longitudinal item response models that are specific cases of the approach.","inCitations":["3385ef133b9674038b236c6e3e9a9c124d70eab6","5703534b8c917f2ba622f033b7ee4956a800d0e5","52317d0fa8995381ad5f384a3c878a0525c867fd","2d8bc61730c756318f88efa0c290f48faaa65257","a9144b94dcc6d216803eff97d3f494203b6e9c35","aa7ffa64a513efb3b0799aa6c835cec7375433f0","5d41a963ce851567867e33837409634f55ae8bde","1c55b3a58e10a24669445e516aba34cb66fc217c","cd7045839ea072c101312e9e0ca7d38400a835e1","0a064e30981389f60a748a52628cf443a32eedca","a05a9f6d009ed9773a9aaaea43dfa08ad856d5fa","1429ce2501bd1ccc89317fea888babd20db060dd","23f9b082301dfe41fb7d05f2193a53d3adeb3063","9ed60b8cf90d48e994310bfa90f03249cef6f797","50d75c5fe8ccce013ecb91f4840648221c997c0c","2b49488ffc71a9f8d15aabb21464047a9479c59f","7f1541cd3a58d252aaaf139dbf629d33f95c8885","75812511682f4f83941d53d4252fe4f2e059b5a1","6b170fe73ae42c404047a3aeb79da02a7f6ef77e","ba232cecfeb75db9ba680c309d6a37bafe1e6c0a","9a0d018d05f7a5ee7c688619454540a408dc03b6","86478eeb4cc22f362dc33e0a6c6e67066814b8bc","8e57ae03e2c1d46c40a88b9c583d28f2a5b4d77f","497a9d789eb0a415108933d78cfbc3378dd0ef20","28f7d15bf98066465f9485ec60616c593e09746c","b56eedcb578f2a19e8507edbf428e8c5f3c8128d"],"title":"Analysis of multivariate mixed longitudinal data: a flexible latent process approach.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12000"}

Recently, a new perspective based on asymptotic series has been introduced to make progress on this problem. Specifically, closed-form expressions have been derived for the first few terms in an asymptotic expansion of the two-locus sampling distribution when the recombination rate ρ is moderate to large. In this paper, a new computational technique is developed for finding the asymptotic expansion to an arbitrary order. Computation in this new approach can be automated easily. Furthermore, it is proved here that only a finite number of terms in the asymptotic expansion is needed to recover (via the method of Padé approximants) the exact two-locus sampling distribution as an analytic function of ρ; this function is exact for all values of ρ ∈ [0, ∞). It is also shown that the new computational framework presented here is flexible enough to incorporate natural selection.","inCitations":["1f5cbed8210b699871e27a54b95db0bca4cc2355","e91e9475d8c833a881ee9519f400486bb877f81d","61daf178406dd06c41d35a4687f22a5fa1d2d807","cf257ee62475b639dba4628c7194808bd9508cf6","ea3543d9174c5957f519ef85154930e07f10f972","d76ec00eca92f7fbdf2dba9fb2b9d1f997d5cd90","bc7f7f6eb2dc18490733d7253d9ef4412805aa87","05181c4a59fe8d96ce172860a3aa70bee95f5841","a3bd00e87c3a412b3ea58f31d90c78d946aacfcd","9bf02575de98138f490aa8e7cf940902936af0da","3acef3773227b56d184f62ed2afc8b8c49b4948c","98edb85dc419475406e08e7772e11f6e5cf83e53","8efa68aedbdfaa17df81983d150a668001a0e3f7","ab30b47cf0ca8e542b206393f9309e3fa90c6e4d"],"title":"Padé Approximants and Exact Two-locus Sampling Distributions.","doi":"10.1214/11-AAP780"}

Potential clinical outcomes are compared across dose groups using a marginal structural model (MSM) based on a weighted pooled repeated measures analysis (generalized estimating equations with robust estimates of standard errors), with dose effect represented by current dose and recent dose history, and weights estimated from the data (via logistic regression) and determined as products of (i) inverse probability of receiving dose assignments that were actually received and (ii) inverse probability of remaining on treatment by this time. In simulations, this method led to almost unbiased estimates of true dose effect under various scenarios. Results were compared with those obtained by unweighted analyses and by weighted analyses under various model specifications. The simulation showed that the IPTW MSM methodology is highly sensitive to model misspecification even when weights are known. Practitioners applying MSM should be cautious about the challenges of implementing MSM with real clinical data. Clinical trial data are used to illustrate the methodology.","inCitations":["3426592c30dc50a893da1ce92a19b68ee6045cad"],"title":"The challenges of evaluating dose response in flexible-dose trials using marginal structural models.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1540"}

Statistically, the challenge is that of allowing for multiple comparisons arising both from repeated analyses of the accumulating data and from selection of a treatment on the basis of data that will be included in the final analysis. This challenge can be met in a number of different ways. This paper reviews methods based on the group-sequential methodology for monitoring of sequential clinical trials.

Such a measure is important for the difficult problem of identifying dynamic properties of neuronal circuitries activated by a variety of stimuli and behaviours. We employ two-stage statistical pattern recognition to identify cellular nuclei that express Fos in two-dimensional sections of rat forebrain after administration of antipsychotic drugs. In stage one, we distinguish dark-stained candidate nuclei from image background by a thresholding algorithm and record size and shape measurements of these objects. In stage two, we compare performance of linear and quadratic discriminants, nearest-neighbour and artificial neural network classifiers that employ functions of these measurements to label candidate objects as either Fos nuclei, two touching Fos nuclei or irrelevant background material. New images of neighbouring brain tissue serve as test sets to assess generalizability of the best derived classification rule, as determined by lowest cross-validation misclassification rate. Three experts, two internal and one external, compare manual and automated results for accuracy assessment. Analyses of a subset of images on two separate occasions provide quantitative measures of inter- and intra-expert consistency. We conclude that our automated procedure yields results that compare favourably with those of the experts and thus has potential to remove much of the tedium, subjectivity and irreproducibility of current Fos identification methods in digital microscopy.","inCitations":["65aee5b58412c141607266785c569626c1dc71d2","368cf37a7d2883fc56f70a81a15cc2fe275d31ef"],"title":"Automated identification of Fos expression.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/2.3.351"}

Because confidence intervals/regions are generally understood, tuning penalized regression methods in this way is intuitive and more easily understood by scientists and practitioners. More importantly, our work shows that tuning to a fixed confidence level often performs better than tuning via the common methods based on AIC, BIC, or cross-validation (CV) over a wide range of sample sizes and levels of sparsity. Additionally, we prove that by tuning with a sequence of confidence levels converging to one, asymptotic selection consistency is obtained; and with a simple two-stage procedure, an oracle property is achieved. The confidence region based tuning parameter is easily calculated using output from existing penalized regression computer packages.Our work also shows how to map any penalty parameter to a corresponding confidence coefficient. This mapping facilitates comparisons of tuning parameter selection methods such as AIC, BIC and CV, and reveals that the resulting tuning parameters correspond to confidence levels that are extremely low, and can vary greatly across data sets.

It is common that a comparison between two treatments is focused on and that only subjects receiving one of these two treatments are considered in the analysis even though more than two treatments are available. In this paper, we provide empirical and theoretical evidence that the IV methods may result in biased treatment effects if applied on a data set in which subjects are preselected based on their received treatments. We frame this as a selection bias problem and propose a procedure that identifies the treatment effect of interest as a function of a vector of sensitivity parameters. We also list assumptions under which analyzing the preselected data does not lead to a biased treatment effect estimate. The performance of the proposed method is examined using simulation studies. We applied our method on The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database to estimate the comparative effect of metformin and sulfonylureas on weight gain among diabetic patients.","inCitations":["aa026f2ea303fda8ee516c848a74c29726340822","bdaf7a36e62728da7630de268f59735af3e2d87f"],"title":"Selection Bias When Using Instrumental Variable Methods to Compare Two Treatments But More Than Two Treatments Are Available","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0006"}

In particular, we develop iterative estimating algorithms and statistical inferences for linear models and estimating equations that update as new data arrive. These algorithms are computationally efficient, minimally storage-intensive, and allow for possible rank deficiencies in the subset design matrices due to rare-event covariates. Within the linear model setting, the proposed online-updating framework leads to predictive residual tests that can be used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the hypothesized model. We also propose a new online-updating estimator under the estimating equation setting. Theoretical properties of the goodness-of-fit tests and proposed estimators are examined in detail. In simulation studies and real data applications, our estimator compares favorably with competing approaches under the estimating equation setting.","inCitations":["81e9104aaba9fc43fe85c3b6ea2b58203576c103","b35918fe04e732a905ffe2a572fe92bff7beaa8d","6f0ba62fb7f55cd9c17322d738afd43bb58ff869","5e0426a6cd28a69b400f060b71da947a8d6025c2","9b34c00d21b00bac8e1f4e60c4637faae4a917d9","2ee67b191a9291e52f710a66e99ade060def5eda","0b8c5a2554ea6d67088fc3ae03a024af13b9b88f","d0c9dc6121b42f075f0118666acd4487c1b0cb4b","0be9c023ff77e16ccc25c000249bc13af47aae8e","39fd74787db13ef2f117cc2bf3c5e8734422120d","101547831e48c5f6e9a4fedee5bae194a1dbce57","54889c05abbf4eaa897f2d1b31daaa20de6d59bd","9e650fb4b4d51a612a206d6094c74cf974ccda95","e89af1f422769b211b963132a9bcd0c804b4f506","cebb916ff84450928218df8d53c417494409bc47","ba1e4df6f47096cae78054a00f58b873db197acb","ec42fc44556bfb5b51fda577963481ccaa692572","0802011931bf5b2f5957a9dd5b4b3e242d4b00e1"],"title":"Online Updating of Statistical Inference in the Big Data Setting","doi":"10.1080/00401706.2016.1142900"}

Our aims were to confirm that height skewness and kurtosis change with age during puberty, to devise a model to explain why, and to test the model by analyzing the data longitudinally. Heights of 3245 Christ's Hospital School boys born during 1927-1956 were measured twice termly from 9 to 20 years (n=129508). Treating the data as independent, the mean, standard deviation (SD), skewness, and kurtosis were calculated in 40 age groups and plotted as functions of age t. The data were also analyzed longitudinally using the nonlinear random-effects growth model H(t)=h(t-epsilon )+alpha, with H(t) the cross-sectional data, h(t) the individual mean curve, and epsilon and alpha subject-specific random effects reflecting variability in age and height at peak height velocity (PHV). Mean height increased monotonically with age, while the SD, skewness, and kurtosis changed cyclically with, respectively, 1, 2, and 3 turning points. Surprisingly, their age curves corresponded closely in shape to the first, second, and third derivatives of the mean height curve. The growth model expanded as a Taylor series in epsilon predicted such a pattern, and the longitudinal analysis showed that adjusting for age at PHV on a multiplicative scale largely removed the trends in the higher moments. A nonlinear growth process where subjects grow at different rates, such as in puberty, generates cyclical changes in the higher moments of the frequency distribution.","inCitations":["fbceb6d538118ba590ff45d7bb556e50e1dd5b92","ef4796bb03acb53808691481834ca5b0b9879904","3ee0a7a775ef3dc7847365c285481d52ae9c2fe1","a69423a7528db740800cd06f446ffb07db498beb","05492659159697690d0980475bf8d38a2e1cd938","10b30f7eabdb723e91d4eb0d992f632868922e4e","77befa80b739ef703ecf34f093e67b86c0a2be62","e90e1d3b679a62e41a3efbff0ae7b4eaff665e94","ce42e31a01d3fe4abe523dbc45bf12873adc5f46","9b8db5b2e9da9e84c4af2dec049104b07c8254c4","e148c70f76729e68c841a8a240034eec83820d23","bd7f477be628b7ead079d9c4e2dac4b6498d2d05","3a31a16690f9c19e1e12bb05a553c6b69d589119","e18ca57a2c7359993d64e79345d82616e1799233","b9ff88f1d13d96a33778abea9e0c38bc8b7bc010","66144912cb6720a6abb9ae0f7b8a2cf19bc5f80a","d4ced9e75097704a762808b36fe289beb827eb93"],"title":"Nonlinear growth generates age changes in the moments of the frequency distribution: the example of height in puberty.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm020"}

We illustrate our method with a quality-of-life study for patients with early stage prostate cancer.

Formal models of task performance were employed to address several issues concerning stress effects on cognitive functioning. Examined were effects on parallel versus serial processing structure, task-wise processing capacity, strategies of allocating processing resources to task components, and curtailment of processing of relevant task elements. Contrary to prediction, stressor presence generated slightly more rather than less evidence of a parallel versus serial processing structure. There was some suggestion of central-task capacity depletion among more susceptible subjects, in line with certain theoretical positions. Evidence of curtailed exhaustive processing of relevant stimulus items was negative. Most notable was the disruption by stress among susceptible subjects of performance-enhancing strategies of deploying processing resources across the different task components (elements of the visual display and within-trial stages of processing). Such effects have received relatively little attention in this research domain; their investigation is shown to be made tractable, however, through the application of selected formal models of information processing.","inCitations":["80d55bda7bcbae7d2b96c344874845424a03d43c","6938757950d7a198c07c8f43f9531e2e4b3aa70b","1d5cef076c6afbbf668b9bc776f7e935ffade629","34e2bb611e05adcf085123f3b172556f38c2b152","b03c451097a4b35ca13e60ec2774519cecb370b7","513ba89defcbe9669320e965de9c9363a33bfeec","f386564b825a8a18d7064e1d2fb3cdc8b2b1f15d","4449ceacb130ae344d94d4aaddeb2111a2d7e3c7","3df62cd473fc023a071f5d45aea254367f6acd39","95ae83b974b73ae7efeb17176b39f4b7e1a253e6","130055b81fa26d9dbb60404a0dabb419f650a85e","f686160002bff20f18550a3a4ed25909b9216a26","20d09f5613105ad4ba9ae3d6ae7e13680c0cf248","97735d2bb86abbc26e54916d044fd8614608951c","bdf5307e4be65e5114863614bb58a36572f0abed","5db3b627ced004d284878fcb41c8204708ae470b"],"title":"A formal analysis of stressor and stress-proneness effects on simple information processing.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1994.tb01034.x"}

Since more and more data from different biological systems or technological platforms are being generated at an incredible rate, there is an increasing need to develop statistical methods that are applicable to multiple data types and platforms. Motivated by such a need, a flexible finite mixture model that is applicable to methylation, gene expression, and potentially data from other biological systems, is proposed. Two major thrusts of this approach are to allow for a variable number of components in the mixture to capture non-biological variation and small biases, and to use a robust procedure for parameter estimation and probe classification. The method was applied to the analysis of methylation signatures of three breast cancer cell lines. It was also tested on three sets of expression microarray data to study its power and type I error rates. Comparison with a number of existing methods in the literature yielded very encouraging results; lower type I error rates and comparable/better power were achieved based on the limited study. Furthermore, the method also leads to more biologically interpretable results for the three breast cancer cell lines.","inCitations":["d9cee1b2f7b6ddc45c65cc6fe63211991bc8bc63","4c58964ee82c54bb491b5fd5786a6c78257b5631","9339111f4c1f4df1230d7e866e7df9b1d05dd02c","28ef1aa8ed45736dc597772f59a8d0c0ee021764","085c86cbe25cfaf4de1b8622f1c5a4d7fae88772","1841fff42ee46fedc332ccbf9c7f1d602a45fad3","ebd52c6551af0b2a70323e4b406c6bc90e5f4b22","4cb26ca0fc668c8be83d7ab87c0472474a249a54"],"title":"A robust unified approach to analyzing methylation and gene expression data","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.07.010"}

Unlike small molecules, the development of biologic products is not only more complicated but also sensitive to a small change in procedure/environment during the manufacturing process. In practice, biologics are expected to have much larger variation, which will potentially impact the product quality and potency. Thus, it is suggested that the assessment of biosimilarity between biologic products should take variability into consideration, in addition to average biosimilarity of endpoints of interest. In this article, we propose the use of nonparametric tests for evaluation of biosimilarity in variability between the follow-on biologic product and the reference product. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the relative performance of the proposed methods with the adapted parametric F-test in terms of correctly concluding biosimilarity in variability. Under normality assumption, the proposed nonparametric tests are found to be comparably well with the adapted F-test. However, the proposed methods are more robust when the assumption is violated.","inCitations":["63aff7336cde449ca6648e7e87dc4fe2719642b1","3485c87ea4c014b50e93759f1e9f021421a083d6"],"title":"Nonparametric tests for evaluation of biosimilarity in variability of follow-on biologics.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.941991"}

It is of major interest when the goal is to discover other genetic variations besides the major gene and to get accurate estimates of penetrance (i.e. unbiased by unknown confounding factors). This approach is further extended to accommodate missing genotypes in family members and the non-random ascertainment of the families.

Furthermore, a generalization of the squared trace correlation (RT2) for multivariate probit models, denoted by pseudo-RT2, is proposed. A simulation study was conducted, simulating a probit model with an equicorrelation structure in the errors of an underlying regression model and using two different missing mechanisms. For a low 'true' correlation the difference between the GEPSE, a generalized estimating equations (GEE) and a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator were negligible. For a high 'true' correlation the GEPSE estimator turned out to be more efficient than the GEE and very efficient relative to the ML estimator. Furthermore, the pseudo-RT2 was close to RT2 of the underlying linear model. The mixed approach is illustrated using a psychiatric data set of depressive in-patients. The results of this analysis suggest that the depression score at discharge from a psychiatric hospital and the occurrence of stressful life events seem to increase the probability of having an episode of major depression within a one-year interval after discharge. Furthermore, the correlation structure points to short-time effects on having or not having a depressive episode, not accounted for in the systematic part of the regression model.","inCitations":["ca7304060fadd3b4fef966f05c31d7db70bc5c8d","867038504db8958e7ed6ce975be389123e2a8f35","03ac23ddcd2e88896b794536ca467c0bfac1ae49","2456f9b6f1950be1a18cbc643bc54a83a01861d9","9818a1519082925ccf5a701a0c4dc521c074d843","59a6bc387edc462db26a99f8062c629d80163bcd"],"title":"A mixed approach and a distribution-free multiple imputation technique for the estimation of a multivariate probit model with missing values.","doi":"10.1348/000711099158928"}

SigmaPlot does indeed have many excellent features and any psychologist could feel proud of many of the graphs it produces (not the box plots). As to the competition, JMP-IN produces a similar rage of graphs (and a rotating 3D plot for factor analysis), but has much less flexibility about appearance in terms of colours, fills and other features of graph elements. It can also be difficult to make different graphs the same size appear neatly on the page. STATVIEW produces less graph forms, and does not perform the non-linear regression, but has similar excellent control of the colour, form and sizing of different graph elements. Both STATIVEW and JMP-IN have well implemented 'by variable' facilities and produce graphs well linked to their associated statistical analyses. SigmaPlot wins on the flexibility of its error bars. However, EXCEL and other spreadsheets are also well worth considering, as they produce the same range of graphics and are equally flexible over error bars. An experimenter would have to be very sure that the slight advantages in flexibility of presentation from SigmaPlot outweighed the hassle of having to totally re-organize their data.","inCitations":["0b4dccc1f7a4a7347a511d41dcb8be8933a573dc","6a085303b7225a400b6500be88efd95564ebfb7f","0515d4c37ef3f09d1ab22efe3c2e1c41e13b9545","05a286248f25b42b6771e81a9f74285777e29d9b","320b06c6cab5e1abbd6554fe676992c36b91b82f","4a1f32108e4395dcd3c41f50cba259753ec89370","4996203dbedeea79bbe6e6cb0cd3c041291be4c1","e2e4ffcea52e0be44e96be841ff6c16622f6b116"],"title":"Statistical software for microcomputers: SigmaPlot 2000 and SigmaStat2","doi":"10.1348/000711000159268"}

When reinfestation is present, household randomization tends to magnify treatment differences when compared with individual randomization or a randomized blocking design in the simple setting of two patients per household. The effect of reinfestation under more general household randomization settings is investigated by determining the relationship between the treatment effect and the number of patients per household. In an actual clinical study of treatment for head lice infestation, household randomization with proper stratification was adopted. The results from the study were consistent with theoretical expectations. This seeming contradiction to the blocking principle demonstrates the need to check whether all conditions are met before applying standard design principles.","inCitations":["96518481d93b137df2ae86362c1b68c791ad5d6a"],"title":"Effect of within-household reinfestation on design sensitivity.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120019368"}

A challenge in designing the trial was that both the efficacy and toxicity outcomes were defined as four-level ordinal variables. To reflect possibly complex joint effects of the two doses on each of the two outcomes, for each marginal distribution a generalised continuation ratio model was assumed, with each agent's dose parametrically standardised in the linear term. A copula was assumed to obtain a bivariate distribution. Elicited outcome probabilities were used to construct a prior, with variances calibrated to obtain small prior effective sample size. Elicited numerical utilities of the 16 elementary outcomes were used to compute posterior mean utilities as criteria for selecting dose pairs, with adaptive randomisation to reduce the risk of getting stuck at a suboptimal pair. A simulation study showed that parametric dose standardisation with additive dose effects provides a robust, reliable model for dose pair optimisation in this setting, and it compares favourably with designs based on alternative models that include dose-dose interaction terms. The proposed model and method are applicable generally to other clinical trial settings with similar dose and outcome structures.","inCitations":["32056bcab22c6f5cb6cbe852ea4f5cdf6ad7af45","e52b774d3cb7ffcb5dbbb7d8fd12e4a5e0724092"],"title":"Parametric Dose Standardization for Optimizing Two-Agent Combinations in a Phase I-II Trial with Ordinal Outcomes.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12162"}

Genetic Matching (GenMatch) matches on the Pscore and individual covariates using an automated search algorithm to balance covariates. This paper compares common ways of implementing Pscore matching and IPTW, with Genmatch for balancing time-constant baseline covariates}. The methods are considered when estimates of treatment effectiveness are required for patient subgroups, and the treatment allocation process differs by subgroup. We apply these methods in a prospective cohort study that estimates the effectiveness of Drotrecogin alfa activated, for subgroups of patients with severe sepsis. In a simulation study we compare the methods when the Pscore is correctly specified, and then misspecified by ignoring the subgroup-specific treatment allocation. The simulations also consider poor overlap in baseline covariates, and different sample sizes. In the case study, GenMatch reports better covariate balance than IPTW or Pscore matching. In the simulations with correctly specified Pscores, good overlap and reasonable sample sizes, all methods report minimal bias. When the Pscore is misspecified, GenMatch reports the least imbalance and bias. With small sample sizes, IPTW is the most efficient approach, but all methods report relatively high bias of treatment effects. This study shows that overall GenMatch achieves the best covariate balance for each subgroup, and is more robust to Pscore misspecification than common alternative Pscore approaches.","inCitations":["5ff53b360307c85d37aee4f8f7445f8472d2e46c","11ef682754addddc04d44e9934a9323b83d9e5db","fb442a82823f3e26ee11dcccd7869d47532aacf0","700bd177a19ffacd62fefe286d5bfc95b107c744","e34e7b8d11610e919f96a901d13f07a0f01f58c0","691580ded4f71f71918bdbf41d8cf66178056be2","44f3191d4e4aef0052f32ece96755792fc5ee055","bc5574c699a0838f2fc049aff6fa09b21c2bb079","7918859956b0be0e0d79561ce3d300d928fd1bd5","fba6430dbf9559f26b1a996b71902f22ff2c93c0","2a127ae826710e91928205ad797fbfebed1c2295","137416a59c7684b7cb59e9984877aaed63b33827","06e907c7b1e70f1059914d2ec7b627f3ba9bdb95","89db76b3b6d13538377a2f62a2c5b8a44f767828","ecc0ad122924105254801a6a6a580b7cc4640823","0713fc8ed5c1ead025eedc43a456a9f7d5b444ce"],"title":"Evaluating treatment effectiveness in patient subgroups: a comparison of propensity score methods with an automated matching approach","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1382"}
