The procedures are compared with regard to actual Type I error and power and examples are provided. The conditional approach and the E + M approach performed well, with the E + M approach having an actual level much closer to the nominal level. The E + M approach and the conditional approach are generally more powerful than the other p-value calculation approaches in the scenarios considered. The power difference between the conditional approach and the E + M approach is often small in the balance case. However, in the unbalanced case, the power comparison between those two approaches based on our proposed test statistic show that the E+ M approach has higher power than the conditional approach.","inCitations":["ad71c0e5bbbc868eb0ee99dbd10201d3f97d3dfe","fa10a4076ebf80d6d641f15fb899e6512daa3e27","f7bd078b6f51d785625e0e097cdbd273ec533ef2","fbb856d8dfdca6e8f01916d63a6c29fd5f9fd021","b7c872d9248edcd2ef4845399d415aae5f0f3eda","50e3274159c330fb1c6e264fd50eb48b6b25f518","f2ce2228b8a30569e201e4c4bf7bb6ee9657a841","dff37284d5b1fc18cb05aac588f8294f772b7162","62896c1f80b7074a2662f234a755cccadfd23eef","8cc49eca5b3c59ac46c068f7d78d22592335e47e"],"title":"Some tests for detecting trends based on the modified Baumgartner-Weiß-Schindler statistics","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2012.04.021"}

These models, introduced by Robins, model the marginal distributions of treatment-specific counterfactual outcomes, possibly conditional on a subset of the baseline covariates. Marginal structural models are particularly useful in the context of longitudinal data structures, in which each subject's treatment and covariate history are measured over time, and an outcome is recorded at a final time point. However, the utility of these models for some applications has been limited by their inability to incorporate modification of the causal effect of treatment by time-varying covariates. Particularly in the context of clinical decision making, such time-varying effect modifiers are often of considerable or even primary interest, as they are used in practice to guide treatment decisions for an individual. In this article we propose a generalization of marginal structural models, which we call history-adjusted marginal structural models (HA-MSM). These models allow estimation of adjusted causal effects of treatment, given the observed past, and are therefore more suitable for making treatment decisions at the individual level and for identification of time-dependent effect modifiers. Specifically, a HA-MSM models the conditional distribution of treatment-specific counterfactual outcomes, conditional on the whole or a subset of the observed past up till a time-point, simultaneously for all time-points. Double robust inverse probability of treatment weighted estimators have been developed and studied in detail for standard MSM. We extend these results by proposing a class of double robust inverse probability of treatment weighted estimators for the unknown parameters of the HA-MSM. In addition, we show that HA-MSM provide a natural approach to identifying the dynamic treatment regimen which follows, at each time-point, the history-adjusted (up till the most recent time point) optimal static treatment regimen. We illustrate our results using an example drawn from the treatment of HIV infection.","inCitations":["3c7c29486ce668c1888a1c8214a9914afab0c17a","8e8b74f49b6cabde2ce36cf90653758d9186f1c6","5b394bc3f1332674958f3cf4c443a8802bf3701c","646396749b27926e605a25241e78a189f1d693c2","71b8b09616772ec7050e0e57f594440b704116ef","31b16cb76e4e1461b28400927f41c97a283272c1","a58005780902eda807118fe130a43fc924d2a2d9","2a3f37e144ba9f84da112bbd7631d7981c686061","13b5212a0b95332827a932863aed8e79242d7ac8","9151d84629277bab26148bdb6379626b44e1cd0a","59194934ad55c250547e15d36a88d0335277ab84","3f7dd1e8fefe0872a34214088fc33c2218ed5289","611d2b955143d2c9ef10b2b169775cb05b53b748","9e2c5191d322a6ab720778cc2412247c1facc10e","f1232b518ae4b7f05647e68e5db69a753c55eb3c","fc41ac21596f8d2da1214f9c0fca9f4942639340","efd9742cb274a548b1255c342a8553275c7c142b","1847dbe105401f2bfa1cfbaac35d89be8bb69ce4","48d4f716939215907dc51d5bbd6d45c7b05f0e29","3a58a191e48766a4d938fc69a34c183b83fbe8bf","ff690a56bff464fd9a39ef25012c60366032edb0","574e8ceee80a6907f1918c7e647325f74f5530e3","3637d4bf1d6af1bd9dbc46bc2b78db2eaaf3a260","a62ce812a0eed7a2d1e88ba17b6e71a881d49cd3","fd63cae6559b98cf49e2c493d1b4aa5473eaa693","74264b1a86efc480b4656485a7d6cd806d3139ab","b7168ba6706836178b8ef4a850d281f33fc0bc89","73004f4cc2768cae76528ec472601d10ae7607de","c5485cfad84936838da1b2fe0abee26cbb7b371c","f8e12f600388d631ce07bf2a18a37c7c48a6b891","fb3bc1d6f74256e10a09fc0cff260593303e4c06","e6f12f4a3884dfc7f927c503fb37fb80d0fb26bf","c6bdd4f1c2f5da5caa32e7ab6eb9acdef70d397f","b6fe2d135767c4e1bb3e37ac3d3439471cf42bb6","b0b6e8bde49aab0c61973594a3ee072bbdaf8d23","2beef38f5a3b7a2fd52e64d2b5a7f7cebc5479b4","abb8112e9bbf80be174212d6e920863d6d7df560","84956b93631269a9f382833ce6e68c78c61dd023","ac7b38c7eb07f234b2fdc0360c5a48aa35f273ab","4467ef17978e9166493c917e0df280fc3864d49d","cb8500f6e8c9b7200f16f1ab147fdc617af2f15b","0af0637decd1b6052a5beff9c335099f340a0c6f","97bf74af7a4c2b690dab3ebf0a7898dacb217576"],"title":"History-Adjusted Marginal Structural Models and Statically-Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimens","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1003"}

More recently it has been used to monitor surgical outcomes whereby it 'signals' if sufficient evidence has accumulated that there has been a change in the surgical failure rate. A limitation of the standard CUSUM procedure in this context is that since it is simply based on the observed surgical outcomes, it may signal as a result of changes in the referral pattern, such as an increased proportion of high-risk patients, rather than due to a change in the actual surgical performance. We describe a new CUSUM procedure that adjusts for each patient's pre-operative risk of surgical failure through the use of a likelihood-based scoring method. The procedure is therefore ideally suited for settings where there is a variable mix of patients over time.","inCitations":["e95acdaaadee73542312cb30ca271881a5166b6b","5c89b2e839c1a1486e7194d40cc779611a46a887","9ad1b6dd93e5153ded95638cd46adf8c4900d4f1","8c5b2185b7e07c9649657c87fe49f86d7c866c2a","1bd59a9c2ce2045f08f5c2e5d6829fa075f58b83","d088fbaa79ee9771db0df89bb4967f2a808c221e","7f0bafe11f380f138cc08f6781cc908ddc8d3063","82a68be566b734b082478f2d12751e3118d03386","8b70d7129eb2dfae48f9e8c0b0c6e56964218045","390cccd2882e26c672cdb6522be48b9edcb5b99a","b78c908be5e1091610aff653eaaa726b1d719a08","51a1020335203964524702b4ab3f7b7c6a4cd872","33f6d15b8445d4b0d39171e1c79f7b90d78f26ed","5426e4ecc0cf476e27a9fe5ddcd5f7a14e9ae22e","da7a5459cbd0ba7ea81d18c76758c9f67f80d817","d7711f1f704a090f480c1234f1dc3cd663583ca5","d01768470db7d0d56d30e0599adf3dc5c34ee354","f0fa89f53d7cfcd042e3d59b33da649ac19a7717","720eb36e558214beb138800c138960af81e01335","220c4e64af8ab56a400943b84b7162d73dd79425","61e32a5a31cc6c4a064a4471b917fe880e11a0e7","05b8a80ffbcf59e39767643d718e196454e47da5","a029a5818ca65b1be61d47a332efe1c5f35e94c3","1a7080be2d728fc3a6d5c3f3eca268fd30cec767","87486d59d11be910728e1653d490cb18a7c37779","56d98ba64308ed13fc16b3544486d638e9b49f96","67e46d48590226750d72740741596afc2d8ce148","2fce5bf64e4db4dc1d128fe89f46d01323412c4e","734641b743dee1215ac38b007b96bb7926c88582","07017af221273b0da09c373f6243b75ba4f8cfb2","2433cf52f606185b0a791c7314de33cb4f9eadf7","13ffd3481dec53dd4f358f8fc86af9e56905ab97","a57c539eab048f226f7881305243f90eefa8d0d3","d3150afa56a27f3c04560cd9bfd1b1d817d73a65","3106734d78d3fc6790891bd7a618a86d08e673a7","6775ec1450709437a88b97e42cce9eba6d2276ad","f665485df47389b70df37ec038e736b60bd0c020","5a5e0c9c74e6cc293cd081ad2ffaea828664be4a","f946f5b099a6b871bb1cc2ab17bf5c65cec449c6","4d4b06382879f35daa2b2d43446a168523422de0","09b2a5a291ad1355fb42626dddcbfffdd801a1b0","2ef6f65516b8551b4bfdff393b1bb533307ea3e6","2652692005700fea7abfc5cf89fc290030141b97","1b65027da465287b9b629c509141de70197cf880","8f76b7e6e460760feef4006443929e628e51f690","f2940a75f3e3518daca03536a7ca6988eb79925b","30b7b89b6a1da6ca2147ad4617825990197bd0f7","a5c49ec1a3b020877785aa74c2b6d3c828e5040c","9ebb6b5421925a73328d9143a00b6000a914f46e","a433bc2a71830c6ad3364a11a69bd4b19fa40965","ecd310dd5d6f46b2a1a934bb63d66d35df51fb14","3f0e935faab834188c815d5be2576079918bedd1","e06df845b109e20b3f5093e5b96edec3f47ac4ac","ef610390736488b08b2e574a2ace2e851438dd1f","14809a26cf865c406281ed533b0a16dba30c8885","b5d9752aafdbf54c296ce702b45f150742cfb96d","d53708042750aa7de6f96b76779dc52c7d1fe019","4ae971385a355566060210e76f8e02cf193b5258","ee3812140f9972f1cc2ac7308064d3eb9bb52075","d19855dc1014063f102f4de677d2ececc34f4a63","31e358852e9e02ea1972178c8290b1f133a159a9","a118340b2540d815fe404606a4e537ca2df915f9","a69f3dccf62813a737683d9f23463f0fdf22f75b","f32659bc866b0fc6650e6fce3228526cf6f7f2a4","98a295f15129f05d403b8ff7bd957fb5dcd9cf05","ddb3ba27035f4ba1635f9dd166eb415789b5b7bd","23bd3e212db6e06d1df2b162c38acf0d15e0bfda","7a168795716be348828947676cf8929e6bbf0eda","78e0478a6332a71061e0d7ce1cd7753766c2fd31","a225aeb4ef83bb365918d1859ac0c85a5412e36a","cb1ad6e9bdcdd76ee7ab3fafa39091ab281df523","da86c956fd1ef9c253170c1376332fdf7ce6b901","dfbf04bbed5eaeba339d22976b778214461ca822","82252bb8f231f396ed9e615a6500b737933ebb8f","7d38b2e16286a9c35d7dbf475b548431af9dea78","7fec38f47936c2c56a74b7474033275f0244033e","3c13e9bb5c350675170317330c18381f233070fb","1584bbc43bb9e47ab0da42c784045c7eabe1be08","33bc72194944ed63714f24cdfbd904cae77095f0","f5ac629b3d2e44a38b7a9533bb756216bd93e84b","d0b941b69b7ade702a6a814694c259da7e4cd1f0","2182397ba790d976b2bdb26cebb6be67e74eb226","6c812b02221835ce188034f6932200e0462e82ef","3def32a3e4ff9130e68c82475ec546518caf50ba","9b9901c44df7d343526033b94ef7ce12071bfbc2","efb2bf78d094710a3fbf688e2cb8f26d2d781f9e","16543242b8d01703f7fadeeb8ba4102a39cbe355","ffe9709e3abe412a1ac3c1c493cba361f61c2c28","3e273a9ec2b4bff279bce5caaedd8e83770d6668","659f71d10e8e03b0ad63711fa657a9bba526d417","cfd38b874891d8f227b5c7116e1f451994248e8f","bd9f394865f48cb18bb55b8ebf4b49c6ed9d9e6c","2970e3e11d29308427affe25968e97600c718886","c57057c5746fb406a27f52b7896fea36a9020ad0","23a1efffd1fe55ad705f774bd9461740825821a3","9b63996a8eaa1cdf9d4916a8a14c204314791c5d","ea68facba4a85d9412385f49eef77e5661adcac6","01d91e93f46877e4ff6800ab6da2a653240b8803","0d82397311cea54b13da0432984d8136d3fa856d","57c0217c9ff5bd847efc0489123cebfc520bf1d3","4de5be9ad6fc35c01979a01f0ebd11c103ac2c73","e527b1be0d568a0465c12f64d9c081a6a6d1a744","8a509686cde9f1e5b5091b2641c0f1826a137cef","517a37daa15e22bf6608fb675322404dc53011ff","584166026b350000ab7f79b8553505e367971c5c","76b0878dd13f7d0c3913ac039229c58a80c51a4c","894ef7a7a4b184d440f4dc6efbc293bbbf51dd14","f5b51ed6a61f92be455c23bf520e2979fd8da4b2","86cee70331aded3cb6dbab8b2f66ba2dc1c51988","d27cf32153d8617e557d7ce7e6387fd41605bcbc","4eb29574483f55ca8e285d39efb7d7d0ddbe4eed","4aa97a2de05581a619647781fbc5ad02eb93bcf7","0c3608d4e9d92e6ac15324ea098be2a60657ac2d","62e4741dfa3872622b90e7073f7f83a2ea1c0f59","b5df902348af0571b0ffdfa6f805ddce633e07e7","ff5b580caceb75d4ee51087f0e1cbaba

The current methods for evaluation of within-device precision recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guideline EP5-A2 are based on the point estimator. On the other hand, in addition to point estimators, confidence intervals can provide a range for the within-device precision with a probability statement. Therefore, we suggest a confidence interval approach for assessment of the within-device precision. Furthermore, under the two-stage nested random-effects model recommended by the approved CLSI guideline EP5-A2, in addition to the current Satterthwaite's approximation and the modified large sample (MLS) methods, we apply the technique of generalized pivotal quantities (GPQ) to derive the confidence interval for the within-device precision. The data from the approved CLSI guideline EP5-A2 illustrate the applications of the confidence interval approach and comparison of results between the three methods. Results of a simulation study on the coverage probability and expected length of the three methods are reported. The proposed method of the GPQ-based confidence intervals is also extended to consider the between-laboratories variation for precision assessment.","inCitations":["9e072c31de18f5bc7f5346132b43dc684160ee83"],"title":"Statistical inference for the within-device precision of quantitative measurements in assay validation.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903105166"}

The present study proposes Hall's or Johnson's transformation in conjunction with the trimmed mean to deal with the problem. Computer simulation is carried out to evaluate the small-sample behaviour of the proposed methods in terms of Type I error rate and statistical power. The proposed methods are compared with the conventional Student t, Yuen's trimmed t, Johnson's transformation untrimmed t, and Hall's transformation untrimmed t statistics for one-sided and two-sided tests.

ANCOVA is valid when the missing data are completely at random. Likelihood-based linear mixed effects model approaches are valid when the missing data are at random. Pattern-mixture model (PMM) was developed to incorporate non-random missing mechanism. Our simulations suggest that two linear mixed effects models using unstructured covariance matrix for within-subject correlation with no random effects or first-order autoregressive covariance matrix for within-subject correlation with random coefficient effects provide well control of type 1 error (T1E) rate when the missing data are completely at random or at random. ANCOVA using last observation carried forward imputed data set is the worst method in terms of bias and T1E rate. PMM does not show much improvement on controlling T1E rate compared with other linear mixed effects models when the missing data are not at random but is markedly inferior when the missing data are at random.","inCitations":["634e56ad9ab872aea6ff7fd865a1cc594f936344","42de2bccd3236e9a69639f5970d46944ad6f4f40","8b82631f383453f4316519b4827fca9e8283fe4b","c6451315d631c71f5651e4183d7dd1c29714165b"],"title":"Impact of missing data on type 1 error rates in non-inferiority trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.378"}

Standard regression calibration assumes that the measurement error has a homoscedastic measurement error variance. An estimator is proposed to correct regression coefficients for covariate measurement error with heteroscedastic variance. Point and interval estimates are derived. Validation data containing the gold standard must be available. This estimator is a closed-form correction of the uncorrected primary regression coefficients, which may be of logistic or Cox proportional hazards model form, and is closely related to the version of regression calibration developed by Rosner et al. (1990). The primary regression model can include multiple covariates measured without error. The use of these estimators is illustrated in two data sets, one taken from occupational epidemiology (the ACE study) and one taken from nutritional epidemiology (the Nurses' Health Study). In both cases, although there was evidence of moderate heteroscedasticity, there was little difference in estimation or inference using this new procedure compared to standard regression calibration. It is shown theoretically that unless the relative risk is large or measurement error severe, standard regression calibration approximations will typically be adequate, even with moderate heteroscedasticity in the measurement error model variance. In a detailed simulation study, standard regression calibration performed either as well as or better than the new estimator. When the disease is rare and the errors normally distributed, or when measurement error is moderate, standard regression calibration remains the method of choice.","inCitations":["855d293aff8fa1ef7bf773cb9ac4efc8790ab2b7","f91e5a547e508b4ad31fd2bd4fa4bd18d92ca751","bea3022d57c0fd62fe0d4dab2c5d3425a149f401","3f1199c4461acde9da6d78f7f418bf667c921508","80c9dcce3da62c6097556386084d2a75233934f1","9c230139744fae9466666e7b26d0ad8cd8513014","d50db71ef79166549902f6ca150ed15bba015b3d"],"title":"Regression Calibration with Heteroscedastic Error Variance","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1259"}

Unlike traditional sensors which rely on a single chemical interaction, CSA can measure multiple chemical interactions by using chemo-responsive dyes. The color changes of the chemo-responsive dyes are recorded before and after exposure to toxicants and serve as a template for classification. The color changes are digitalized in the form of a matrix with rows representing dye effects and columns representing the spectrum of colors. Thus, matrix-classification methods are highly desirable. In this article, we develop a novel classification method, matrix discriminant analysis (MDA), which is a generalization of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for the data in matrix form. By incorporating the intrinsic matrix-structure of the data in discriminant analysis, the proposed method can improve CSA's sensitivity and more importantly, specificity. A penalized MDA method, PMDA, is also introduced to further incorporate sparsity structure in discriminant function. Numerical studies suggest that the proposed MDA and PMDA methods outperform LDA and other competing discriminant methods for matrix predictors. The asymptotic consistency of MDA is also established.

Therefore, the age-at-onset data are often collected in order to map the disease gene(s).

In this paper, we present a correlated frailty model for censored survival data of siblings.

The model is applied to interval-censored migraine twin data. Heritability (obtained from the frailties rather than actual onset times) was estimated as 0.42; this value was highly significant. The highest lod score, a score of 1.9, was found at the end of chromosome 19.","inCitations":["97fd816bb7a96c00b5997dea39919ac493e8042e","acf3e488c5242d94bd44fa64cc05138a2d8917fb","59c24f9b3234e2eaaa97d3fc48da9b31a25a8805","91e46d7f5488fe7b94b4002917d75d2185d99e27","857bff3c0d0271951a3197db72750d22630ab62c","85e817985241f5265383d757bdcaf5098aee9a72","b474c517a8d7abadd3cb28b97c3199af21ec574f","a54ea1a5c71a1c85a6f811e54ec08f21822c67a5","e1d37c275f7f37d5c0a5a1275c46497f964b2b01","5a73fcce3aa4c540bb2ce21cb3b7cfabc77d16ea","e6aff2270b65ef7730b596bf3d2d63692bcc61de","686b754eae7a084b4757c98b5364f4f88a6788c7"],"title":"Gamma frailty model for linkage analysis with application to interval-censored migraine data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn027"}

Most commonly, it is used to understand the etiology of a public health issue, to assess the impact of an intervention, or to provide detection of unusual behavior. In this article, we present a Bayesian mixture model for public health surveillance, which is able to provide estimates of the disease risk in space and time, and also to detect areas with unusual behavior. The model is designed to deal with a range of spatial and temporal patterns in the data, and with time series of different lengths. We carry out a simulation study to assess the performance of the model under different scenarios, and we compare it against a recently proposed Bayesian model for short time series. Finally, the proposed model is used for surveillance of road traffic accidents data in England over the years 2005-2015.","inCitations":["bf8b2bc9d0e72e0439619631e7f29301a1a5a6fa"],"title":"A Bayesian mixture modeling approach for public health surveillance.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy038"}

For traits with variable age-at-onset, it may be of interest to investigate whether age-at-onset itself also exhibits familial clustering. A complication in such investigations is that censoring by age-at-ascertainment can induce artifactual familial correlation in the age-at-onset of affected members. A further complication can be that sample inclusion criteria involve the affection status of family members. The purpose here is to present an approach to testing for correlation that is not confounded by censoring by age-at-ascertainment and may be applied with a broad range of inclusion criteria. The approach involves regression statistics in which subjects's covariate terms are chosen to reflect age-at-onset information from the subjects's affected family members. The results of analyses of data from a family-study of panic disorder illustrate the approach.","inCitations":["7ee7c631e782a392e78f34690fbcb4c274ab9ee6","81d1f6454d70442032de796f4c16611aba1e1f01","de08241d90f74e28551321dd897dec6455ea2098"],"title":"Testing for familial correlation in age-at-onset.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.1.77"}

Furthermore, a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo method that combines the Gibbs sampler, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and Langevin-Hastings algorithm is implemented to produce the Bayesian outputs. Finally, the proposed approach is illustrated by a simulation study and a real example.","inCitations":["5cc396f458a749b3104130f39d43b0fc951a32cd"],"title":"Bayesian analysis for finite mixture in non-recursive non-linear structural equation models.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X466367"}

A typical study will have three batches, several strengths, several packages, and several storage conditions. Thus, if every batch by strength by package combination is tested for every storage condition, i.e., if a complete factorial design is used, a substantial expense is involved. To reduce expense, a matrix design is commonly used; e.g., only the smallest and largest bottles are tested. Fractional factorial-type designs for stability studies are proposed, and the statistical powers of various designs are compared.","inCitations":["e04d589f772319a28026431e848fc044085fefdb","cfd3f842fb04c1c81235aaff6efe44f576e0f74b","66c0a757ce8e5a47882758b1d85351f7c2f3f411","868c4616939b89a85a775c7fe695bfdee2651d14","cee7e0dcad6318711e7763c29d2b98e222924f92","00eb56da224c5bd7bab33b5708269299254319af","3e5c88b4f4f4624f05dc8f939ea2da681cdfc6b7"],"title":"Statistical comparison of stability study designs.","doi":"10.1080/10543409208835033"}
