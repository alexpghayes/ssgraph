Further studies have been made, concerning relatives of other degrees of affinity than siblings, but these did not usually yield joint distributions. Recently this aspect of the problem has been studied in the framework of a Galton-Watson process.... In these studies the population is treated as monotype. Applications such as pedigree studies of diseases require a multitype approach (in the example, two types: victims and others). In this paper such a study is undertaken.\" Problems and questions involved in this type of approach are discussed, and joint distributions are obtained under a number of sampling schemes.","inCitations":["ee784b5bce6488bcc6807925391bc61c04a09ddf","1310349c62b9dc9e75c2e70ba2a1d48e3f7a4b01"],"title":"The kin number problem in a multitype Galton-Watson population.","doi":"10.2307/3213746"}

The model is applied to time series data on mortality and morbidity for 10 metropolitan areas in the United States from 1986 to 1993. We postulate that these time series should be related through a shared relationship with PM10. At the first stage of the hierarchy, we fit two seemingly unrelated Poisson regression models to produce city-specific estimates of the log relative rates of mortality and morbidity associated with exposure to PM10 within each location. The sample covariance matrix of the estimated log relative rates is obtained using a novel generalized estimating equation approach that takes into account the correlation between the mortality and morbidity time series. At the second stage, we combine information across locations to estimate overall log relative rates of mortality and morbidity and variation of the rates across cities. Using the combined information across the 10 locations we find that a 10 microg/m3 increase in average PM10 at the current day and previous day is associated with a 0.26% increase in mortality (95% posterior interval -0.37, 0.65), and a 0.71% increase in hospital admissions (95% posterior interval 0.35, 0.99). The log relative rates of mortality and morbidity have a similar degree of heterogeneity across cities: the posterior means of the between-city standard deviations of the mortality and morbidity air pollution effects are 0.42 (95% interval 0.05, 1.18), and 0.31 (95% interval 0.10, 0.89), respectively. The city-specific log relative rates of mortality and morbidity are estimated to have very low correlation, but the uncertainty in the correlation is very substantial (posterior mean = 0.20, 95% interval -0.89, 0.98). With the parameter estimates from the model, we can predict the hospitalization log relative rate for a new city for which hospitalization data are unavailable, using that city's estimated mortality relative rate. We illustrate this prediction using New York as an example.","inCitations":["7458f25e290b69999e83ac4b777edb45b05d57ae","b735009c89c8dcaf60984014af28689c9f0b9958","9f521f6712a3ba55bf329ecaca1fc700ac30e79e","51a93ccccaba1e35ab4e0b20db3db3efa0e36c00","da56bef58e981b26dfc5af1663ecc0c30c9d8f2f","77c7d9f182cd9b48b4f51b327b169d04e513fbdb","c33e24e8704c5f42b3e9c14f1f1f11b3c77e67f9","533f0f2e75b3b3b3a543c8544f97aa52c61cf8e0","8e1f13691dfdb95e3da4314065eb72bf53c8c40b","99a5a55d18c98c0849589f1c6d3529362c12a9e5"],"title":"Hierarchical bivariate time series models: a combined analysis of the effects of particulate matter on morbidity and mortality.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxg040"}

Not accounting for such left-censoring appropriately can lead to biased parameter estimates in most data analysis. To properly adjust for left-censoring, this paper presents an extension of the Tobit model for fitting nonlinear dynamic mixed-effects models with skew distributions. Such extensions allow one to specify the conditional distributions for viral load response to account for left-censoring, skewness and heaviness in the tails of the distributions of the response variable. A Bayesian modeling approach via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to estimate model parameters. The proposed methods are illustrated using real data from an HIV/AIDS study.","inCitations":["c5fe92c9180986bea79569444a652dce04c7905a","e1b448181feecef0e4120cc9351ab9d48ca34375","9be582d135ead3bd403b6a1d98e71f387dac9e67"],"title":"Bayesian inference for a nonlinear mixed-effects Tobit model with multivariate skew-t distributions: application to AIDS studies","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1387"}

Here we present two contributions to statistical methodology for this purpose. First, we propose and compare a set of wavelet-domain procedures for fitting generalized linear models with scalar responses and image predictors: sparse variants of principal component regression and of partial least squares, and the elastic net. Second, we consider assessing the contribution of image predictors over and above available scalar predictors, in particular via permutation tests and an extension of the idea of confounding to the case of functional or image predictors. Using the proposed methods, we assess whether maps of a spontaneous brain activity measure, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging, can meaningfully predict presence or absence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Our results shed light on the role of confounding in the surprising outcome of the recent ADHD-200 Global Competition, which challenged researchers to develop algorithms for automated image-based diagnosis of the disorder.","inCitations":["c8982d9982e1abdd60bcf34b4aef1b688ff6cf3d","68d74b70efc0b29d9d797ee602e7ad875aad0ef1","d7a8cb038d1d8c272e992fe529aab0287276ec5b","f3f807e7eeb09b5011d25c0f5427706dcd80abc6","92480b0e0492fcf305769774afa2b514e4a38b02","be7f545e045c5560749653feacbbbea335be74ad","f507a994c5609306b8e5c5fedf494420fc95411b","bb5f2d60731ab730031eb3c2d5c2be907a66a618","8ad9e9a9a3ea56d687da88a1a2766c8c0d05a0ec","7e0a7e71229a42b95478b312cd2835a9c0ac2dd4","aedabc42f64667bebfc4c8b1c1a999a075768a0a","b35865588cc1b8351f30f19fffe7fafb82c63f40","1c3af3df8e68c9c1fc14ebe89b0be661613bd665","af0b37406f98ed57e7a5de85d88a93ff60f6f5c4","f9a2bf39d243d3f7947f4067be7acba0026e8d5d","6666473c926665eecc741a0dd29e1b329d273e38","41d64b7c32c8610de5075b09b148e5479fdfe215","8fb65e2ce4d9783a926f832585ae5340cbbc055b","7668ff48d0c4faee44423579dc9481a0663e0044"],"title":"Wavelet-domain Regression and Predictive Inference in Psychiatric Neuroimaging.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS829"}

In this article, a James-Stein type shrinkage estimation strategy was developed in a Bayesian logistic regression model to analyze pharmacovigilance data. This method is effective in detecting signals as it combines information and borrows strength across medically related adverse events. Computer simulation demonstrated that the shrinkage estimator is uniformly better than the maximum likelihood estimator in terms of mean squared error. This method was used to investigate the possible association of a series of diabetic drugs and the risk of cardiovascular events using data from the Canada Vigilance Online Database.","inCitations":["7b0a486511897710bcd7aa138e7d3ae4bdaef00f","ce96bb13c2eec47e375574709b38820c38bf9626","3e7ad7d1079bb21634e809072e5dc3153485d1fd","7b59b9898d07b68e8d0147a2004a6433a536b25a"],"title":"Mining pharmacovigilance data using Bayesian logistic regression with James-Stein type shrinkage estimation.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003619056"}

However, for the logistic regression model, variance reduction is not obviously obtained. This can lead to concerns about the assumptions of the logistic model. We introduce a complementary nonparametric method for covariate adjustment. It provides results that are usually compatible with expectations for analysis of covariance. The only assumptions required are based on randomization and sampling arguments. The resulting treatment parameter is a (unconditional) population average log-odds ratio that has been adjusted for random imbalance of covariates. Data from a randomized clinical trial are used to compare results from the traditional maximum likelihood logistic method with those from the nonparametric logistic method. We examine treatment parameter estimates, corresponding standard errors, and significance levels in models with and without covariate adjustment. In addition, we discuss differences between unconditional population average treatment parameters and conditional subpopulation average treatment parameters. Additional features of the nonparametric method, including stratified (multicenter) and multivariate (multivisit) analyses, are illustrated. Extensions of this methodology to the proportional odds model are also made.","inCitations":["7a41f8dc796a1a3ddba38f463c4a42e94c4f4564","72a75a79501959269215ed8717b5a0b48c847c01","b052fe7531b9e15aa3219eaee21b4c979d8648d6","4283303d25d902a3c34a226376c5de40716c97df","50d5e0edd7dc2bc8d8973ecf5097196e8efd20d1","72b3f98f203e82d18def3444ced128167a9a17c7","6c3c184e9bdb7508da1691da60d9592c57fb267f","9a8fb9915f9ce8afaac4987d005ee20b20793ae3","0fa6a5b47ffbde44637657be817a0088a6f4c57b","aadfecb392b4c60d6fe90e51f81390281ca4a6fe","17dde866ca8d00a9a409f610385b8eafd0aa11f0","f5d4537d1c1e1c2e42a79a0ec794ad49fbaa257b"],"title":"Complementary nonparametric analysis of covariance for logistic regression in a randomized clinical trial setting.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100100999"}

This method is capable of detecting genes that are differentially expressed (DE) in only a subset of the combined studies, and the latent variables help quantify homogeneous and heterogeneous differential expression signals across studies. A tight clustering algorithm is applied to detected biomarkers to capture differential meta-patterns that are informative to guide further biological investigation.

In propensity-score matching, pairs of treated and untreated subjects with similar propensity scores are formed. Recent systematic reviews of the use of propensity-score matching found that the large majority of researchers ignore the matched nature of the propensity-score matched sample when estimating the statistical significance of the treatment effect. We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to examine the impact of ignoring the matched nature of the propensity-score matched sample on Type I error rates, coverage of confidence intervals, and variance estimation of the treatment effect. We examined estimating differences in means, relative risks, odds ratios, rate ratios from Poisson models, and hazard ratios from Cox regression models. We demonstrated that accounting for the matched nature of the propensity-score matched sample tended to result in type I error rates that were closer to the advertised level compared to when matching was not incorporated into the analyses. Similarly, accounting for the matched nature of the sample tended to result in confidence intervals with coverage rates that were closer to the nominal level, compared to when matching was not taken into account. Finally, accounting for the matched nature of the sample resulted in estimates of standard error that more closely reflected the sampling variability of the treatment effect compared to when matching was not taken into account.","inCitations":["04e619542fba2ad6557b126d80c5e156484c93b7","001d3560f0833df5262d61096aef43f359da9274","189f1e39afd9384e7ded19d6e99758fe253fb42b","697c571b7f797662836b305adeb63eb73e54c0bd","f8e98e9fce9a0f4ef79e3aa9049933f724c4570a","0d668b9f7ea58f0447d25965eedd5fb15553306b","0551e563fc01587a717fad73b9eca008309cbe74","c829006cdbeb81dd3ec89c88b2a3145b34d80dfd","87b5a813a1dee7b74d799360ed327d633c4d58eb","957dbba7578099a5f537b3a6140f89b396112904","8496da1c2eeeccfa4e312542d169bc2a3189f696","4017f7139bd5547c2633bf314f1eaa15b314b9fa","e5722f83048780751b3a931f9f324f728570f62d","4e6310604a20e0798b05e2c5bdc3a1da30f31253","0c5f781db06964f5b5c38698e594e6779a2efe14","2f29c2a013c75a32d683596f40c88031b043303e","acb971dad4887887b13c73e24c29006d69ace08a","4f11029837d3235f4944c2892957662aab28a213","9880099e55343da4d636ec164762de1910d604cc","24e0117a1f5e0b90825a7bd81290f2fd999d62e8","bc4a8faef960fe66f8c5f69fdd1b1db46a00ccff","d6bb435c9d2f0423ec990127a06ff8789c908727","66388fed7c574e6105d869da3703d44c00ad70c7","24e9f9c8f3a284b969c08682bfe3079277b20e61","b6c01dad288766d224239e74f3a624dc0653fdaf","878497caaf535ecaa209a01abc50b6faa433c01d","d9df01b123790fb0ede60eef5fc934a9eeca262a","70c5c114ace628888c298b580320cc7ffdbc69cb","c5feae78fc8d430dcd889e2dda77d696793a4fc0","d6788c9dd296e73ff8a06e4a74ddcef3c7243c0e","30e544dbc655d14b964638838ba410540ebfb3f5","45dfc58d52d83996a88aa26e2e8348838556506a","5d58ab2c3ccdca7fbe31a5299b1fd97e21ca2dd5","2d91f7e3e5ce7cb688de32ada6fc0df05f7bedfc","f33cc378857bf409b856ba726957b249d4fdd37f","7884ff095ddb0fb7bfa90437381bfecfbc21d2bd","7e7ccf7829a3ab0588e053deb44e819460a254b9","3e9a0801bd1a6557a8e60e3ee457b66377ed4948","831259d19c81d4c48e6507cb19eaf5c70198ada0","eee789a934bd5ef92a80f77d7e9479f455674bc8","444a500cf37399e35df03be98b6023fb67d28c5a","ba536496d71be40c75ab31761040b279684fd336","571c861f818ec6630b402605ed3f3fca1a9aa943","94410db53a0e77282fc2914bc34c8451b77ef676","40c4f1980316b3cf3c9b1932287f5f711057b2ae","ad19d62602b90077d9dda101ec8731e61ceffce4","b9019be7bc2853c170c816b47a94f7e161d5f17f","306ff0b53c9ac8d87fb8fb092feeaebded7890f7","9b3813dbf396149e6288a30815d0ebffcae20f6f","d0d981f1bc20312f541682e9db6bf2865ccc8d15","848204d258bd0ef694c753e7e36cd81a15a12029","52da5fb7f56a2970b75bbcd4e86e4614e6ebd574","a9ad9f9972304c0de885ceba49d3fdd18b4f86bf","ef08af025c2f66e8f014171488c05772493fa105","8c657f24c4f1951ef16f66b4c1ce4ccdddfde72d","4efdc7b6a1a79d3a53d1ae832cbab722a281f684","f63f4a10184450d8108e4b8569dfa644ccfad6fd","5afb40fc76a0b2eb925f3a02fb7d0d75d840a846","36d480546ddbc043493e7ba492fc8a4b973f1f94","5b92b59e158ed76e3efa4ace45ee55db1fc2a73c","a919c7af73627a8676e0e117d08541ca391dc731","360e8606301ecfe41ab375788340719ea4bc16ee","37cfeefe094f5f7f3ce79e2915ac57295e53ed23","deff9129266f3bbf31727686a70f5f188c6a87d6","501ac82b4559248850a35dd4360e639b616110a6","6697fed2d403249a54e9c090ea2686018f255fdd","5a7ce80311848f747203634a933230f2cbe9fe5f","0e5a383b8ca1e8c7bbcce842bd7cabf8856c2806","8c00c952667863cfea4761e0bf9b4944d94e2afd","e6381f459117d05288178b16cc18a5a92d36d881","511ed44411bffcbb249d10e2dda7e8d3876a10bc","185492e18e22927b554409b6cd7bcd2bb2b779ed","44cf9bb0ac2b370df86e2a2a2ead98ddc563a30e","3782c415d8526478ac6aa54e076ec5d6d9e165f7","7a8b80815719795600d94c9ab3b73ed447c5d413","d77a180e716fc92c83bc23c542fc15bacfd56233","dcc695e64ba80c58fab4a00fd5208e4375e1fb48"],"title":"Type I Error Rates, Coverage of Confidence Intervals, and Variance Estimation in Propensity-Score Matched Analyses","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1146"}

The natural logarithm of the baseline mean function, logΛ(0)(t), is approximated by a monotone cubic B-spline function. The estimates of regression parameters and spline coefficients are obtained by projecting the GEE estimates into the feasible domain using a weighted isotonic regression (IR). The proposed method avoids assuming any parametric structure of the baseline mean function or any stochastic model for the underlying counting process. Selection of the working covariance matrix that accounts for overdispersion improves the estimation efficiency and leads to less biased variance estimations. Simulation studies are conducted using different working covariance matrices in the GEE to investigate finite sample performance of the proposed method, to compare the estimation efficiency, and to explore the performance of different variance estimates in presence of overdispersion. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a real data set from a bladder tumor clinical trial.","inCitations":["5727fa020084effdfb69f11255dc8b128ddab2b4","706af2283706de847d79f051d28cf3df6315a7e4","59fdb933964cd64463227715060bad3413a97c90","d5caef4b069550d142895bd5645f794ea3c0ed6b","5ca6425be2521e00ead9c47bb55681b1cfea9141","3f4d9c416b8ab6847df8998da160674a00a48595"],"title":"Spline-based semiparametric projected generalized estimating equation method for panel count data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr028"}

With the number of high-throughput large-scale gene expression studies still on the rise, the need for effective data- summarizing tools has never been greater. By grouping genes according to a common experimental expression profile, we may gain new insight into the biological pathways that steer biological processes of interest. Clustering of gene profiles can also assist in assigning functions to genes that have not yet been functionally annotated. In this paper, we propose 2 model selection procedures for model-based clustering. Model selection in model-based clustering has to date focused on the identification of data dimensions that are relevant for clustering. However, in more complex data structures, with multiple experimental factors, such an approach does not provide easily interpreted clustering outcomes. We propose a mixture model with multiple levels, , that provides sparse representations both \"within\" and \"between\" cluster profiles. We explore various flexible \"within-cluster\" parameterizations and discuss how efficient parameterizations can greatly enhance the objective interpretability of the generated clusters. Moreover, we allow for a sparse \"between-cluster\" representation with a different number of clusters at different levels of an experimental factor of interest. This enhances interpretability of clusters generated in multiple-factor contexts. Interpretable cluster profiles can assist in detecting biologically relevant groups of genes that may be missed with less efficient parameterizations. We use our multilevel mixture model to mine a proliferating cell line expression data set for annotational context and regulatory motifs. We also investigate the performance of the multilevel clustering approach on several simulated data sets.","inCitations":["c17526f836a3b9cec7bf52edea629f59a60c27f6","55bcfe76f4990a877b1904084141c349dc7b48b7","714a53c55784c8a6dd7fd6b11e61efcb939295bd","3ba453570fcfe6979c9ab618a07e1c2c3ccb654d","e65804f7c292987b678e3b48902db387a43c60b1","777e6d96a9835dbbab8cc51b94bd5827ed257a83","94de78edbc3d17bcbc6336830abcd5badd01ddd1","1470679715766c8b5d1a3a5265ce91552f4cef49","3c1c20d2bfda6d59443d7f642ef034b4cfbd28d3"],"title":"Mixture models with multiple levels, with application to the analysis of multifactor gene expression data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm051"}

In many applications, the gap times between two successive recurrent events are natural outcomes of interest. Investigation on patterns of associations among recurrent gap times within subjects is an important inferential issue. In this paper, we introduce flexible functions of previous gap times to create a class of summary measures of serial associations for a sequence of recurrent gap times through Kendall's tau. Such a general class of serial association measures provides a useful tool to quantify the predictive abilities of event history with different aspects. Non-parametric estimators of the proposed measures of serial associations are developed by generalizing the existing estimator of Kendall's tau for two serial gap times, in which inverse probability of censoring weights is used to overcome the induced dependent censoring.

High throughput technology has made such studies possible: in a given tissue sample, it enables us to quantify the expression levels of approximately 20 000 genes and to record the alleles present at millions of genetic polymorphisms. While obtaining this data is relatively cheap once a specimen is at hand, obtaining human tissue remains a costly endeavor: eQTL studies continue to be based on relatively small sample sizes, with this limitation particularly serious for tissues as brain, liver, etc.-often the organs of most immediate medical relevance. Given the high-dimensional nature of these datasets and the large number of hypotheses tested, the scientific community has adopted early on multiplicity adjustment procedures. These testing procedures primarily control the false discoveries rate for the identification of genetic variants with influence on the expression levels. In contrast, a problem that has not received much attention to date is that of providing estimates of the effect sizes associated with these variants, in a way that accounts for the considerable amount of selection. Yet, given the difficulty of procuring additional samples, this challenge is of practical importance. We illustrate in this work how the recently developed conditional inference approach can be deployed to obtain confidence intervals for the eQTL effect sizes with reliable coverage. The procedure we propose is based on a randomized hierarchical strategy with a 2-fold contribution: (1) it reflects the selection steps typically adopted in state of the art investigations and (2) it introduces the use of randomness instead of data-splitting to maximize the use of available data. Analysis of the GTEx Liver dataset (v6) suggests that naively obtained confidence intervals would likely not cover the true values of effect sizes and that the number of local genetic polymorphisms influencing the expression level of genes might be underestimated.","inCitations":["91424d1e7bf928dc4ebb3085163f4bf5d2fff5eb","1a9fcdb5b9b84f24ac2f6fb8cd5b4511f4c6ec56"],"title":"Selection-adjusted inference: an application to confidence intervals for cis-eQTL effect sizes.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz024"}

In principle, this holds the promise of being able to find genomic signatures for a particular disease. In particular, cancer survival is thought to be closely linked to the genomic constitution of the tumor. Discovering such signatures will be useful in the diagnosis of the patient, may be used for treatment decisions and, perhaps, even the development of new treatments. However, genomic data are typically noisy and high-dimensional, not rarely outstripping the number of patients included in the study. Regularized survival models have been proposed to deal with such scenarios. These methods typically induce sparsity by means of a coincidental match of the geometry of the convex likelihood and a (near) non-convex regularizer. The disadvantages of such methods are that they are typically non-invariant to scale changes of the covariates, they struggle with highly correlated covariates, and they have a practical problem of determining the amount of regularization. In this article, we propose an extension of the differential geometric least angle regression method for sparse inference in relative risk regression models.

There is much empirical support for the belief that RR methods improve the cooperation of the respondents. Recently, RR models have been extended to measure individual unidimensional behaviour. An extension of this modelling framework is proposed to measure compensatory or non-compensatory multiple sensitive factors underlying the randomized item response process. A confirmatory multidimensional randomized item response theory model (MRIRT) is proposed for the analysis of multivariate RR data by modelling the response process and specifying structural relationships between sensitive behaviours and background information. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to estimate simultaneously the parameters of the MRIRT model. The model extension enables the computation of individual true item response probabilities, estimates of individuals' sensitive behaviour on different domains, and their relationships with background variables. An MRIRT analysis is presented of data from a college alcohol problem scale, measuring alcohol-related socio-emotional and community problems, and alcohol expectancy questionnaire, measuring alcohol-related sexual enhancement expectancies. Students were interviewed via direct or RR questioning. Scores of alcohol-related problems and expectancies are significantly higher for the group of students questioned using the RR technique. Alcohol-related problems and sexual enhancement expectancies are positively moderately correlated and vary differently across gender and universities.","inCitations":["9bdc94017e607838331e9171d35604948d41ec10","daca00d7b3a22744be2a2dc6c11601cf0fc7be79","312f9426c4fc42fa9261f65f8619771c230a5f48","d5800f7734cbd30610e3d015841bc9767b13141a"],"title":"Compensatory and non-compensatory multidimensional randomized item response models.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12012"}

We first present an examination of the important statistical differences between fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) models in meta-analysis and between two different RE procedures, due to Hedges and Vevea, and to Hunter and Schmidt. The implications of these differences for the appropriate interpretation of published meta-analyses are explored by applying the two RE procedures to 68 meta-analyses from five large meta-analytic studies previously published in Psychological Bulletin. Under the assumption that the goal of research is generalizable knowledge, results indicated that the published FE confidence intervals (CIs) around mean effect sizes were on average 52% narrower than their actual width, with similar results being produced by the two RE procedures. These nominal 95% FE CIs were found to be on average 56% CIs. Because most meta-analyses in the literature use FE models, these findings suggest that the precision of meta-analysis findings in the literature has often been substantially overstated, with
