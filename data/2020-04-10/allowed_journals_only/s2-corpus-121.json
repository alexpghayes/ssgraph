Unlike global nonparametric tests for homogeneity such as the Kolmogorv-Smirnov test, testing the equality of a set of percentiles (i.e., a percentile profile) yields an estimate of the location and extent of the differences between the populations along the entire domain. The Wald test using bootstrap estimates of variance of the order statistics provides a unified method for hypothesis testing of functions of the population percentiles. Simulation studies are conducted to show performance of the method under various scenarios and to give suggestions on its use. Several examples are given to illustrate some useful applications to real data.","inCitations":["3ce725a542234c223349f5f006f42b20bd3cd679","b6d8e58a00524b4b48421ddeb44a2d19cf066509","44a423ecd3a2fa6cce27ab12800b71f4cf007a2d"],"title":"Hypothesis Testing of Population Percentiles via the Wald Test with Bootstrap Variance Estimates.","doi":"10.4236/ojs.2016.61003"}

These estimates may be inaccurate if CCVA is trained on non-local training data different from the local population of interest. This problem is a special case of transfer learning, i.e., improving classification within a target domain (e.g., a particular population) with the classifier trained in a source-domain. Most transfer learning approaches concern individual-level (e.g., a person's) classification. Social and health scientists such as epidemiologists are often more interested with understanding etiological distributions at the population-level. The sample sizes of their data sets are typically orders of magnitude smaller than those used for common transfer learning applications like image classification, document identification, etc. We present a parsimonious hierarchical Bayesian transfer learning framework to directly estimate population-level class probabilities in a target domain, using any baseline classifier trained on source-domain, and a small labeled target-domain dataset. To address small sample sizes, we introduce a novel shrinkage prior for the transfer error rates guaranteeing that, in absence of any labeled target-domain data or when the baseline classifier is perfectly accurate, our transfer learning agrees with direct aggregation of predictions from the baseline classifier, thereby subsuming the default practice as a special case. We then extend our approach to use an ensemble of baseline classifiers producing an unified estimate. Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate how the ensemble model favors the most accurate baseline classifier. We present data analyses demonstrating the utility of our approach.","inCitations":["2c943c2db2e5914d7b636c79db7397736014227b"],"title":"Regularized Bayesian transfer learning for population-level etiological distributions.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa001"}

Bonferroni-Holm, Simes-Hommel, and Resampling-Based methods all are considered in this context. Familywise error rate control heuristics are developed and evaluated using a simulation study that is specifically tailored to the intersection-union setting. Both Resampling-Based and Simes-Hommel uniformly outperform the Bonferroni-Holm. Using simulations of power, the choice of Simes-Hommel versus Resampling-Based is seen to depend on the particular alternative of interest.

Rather than modeling the interaction term per se as with regression methods, a data reduction strategy seeks for a pattern in a combination of factors/ attributes of interest that maximizes the phenotypic variation it explains. It treats the joint action as a whole, coinciding to the very original epitasis coined by Bateson [40], offering a solution that avoids decomposition as in regression methods where the number of interaction parameters grows exponentially as each new variable is added. It also has a straightforward correspondence to the concept of the phenotypic landscape that unifies biological, statistical genetics and evolutionary theories [41-45]. Notably the pioneering MDR method has sustained its popularity in detection of interactions since its launch [46].","inCitations":["5474b86aa66614be9f49aefe76b662c35dddf6db"],"title":"Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions Underlying Complex Traits and their Detection.","doi":"10.15406/bbij.2014.01.00007"}

In recent years numerous studies have evaluated pairs of tumor specimens to examine the similarity of the somatic characteristics of the tumors and to test for clonal relatedness. As the landscape of mutation testing has evolved a number of statistical methods for determining clonality have developed, notably for comparing losses of heterozygosity at candidate markers, and for comparing copy number profiles. Increasingly tumors are being evaluated for point mutations in panels of candidate genes using gene sequencing technologies. Comparison of the mutational profiles of pairs of tumors presents unusual methodological challenges: mutations at some loci are much more common than others; knowledge of the marginal mutation probabilities is scanty for most loci at which mutations might occur; the sample space of potential mutational profiles is vast. In this article we examine this problem and propose a test for clonal relatedness of a pair of tumors from a single patient. Using simulations, its properties are shown to be promising. The method is illustrated using several examples from the literature.","inCitations":["79236c317a82d6063718c0f86270ced1e07d27e7","ed8cd55e7c16b9e2b7eae32fa443f3d2aae677eb","046412e5938d607cde378c92f01172a15c6a72eb","834ba0d9b06909db18c4413032be059e6e7697f3","18d30f4cc55df5cca9c150c7a2e491bfa9472e59","d1a07f79271e0576ccd58c2579ab7703635a84da","6393b690d4cfb0b4c72c38db30a6a1bbe7a97226","1c9e9f85810ed60183c9dcff0304f025c042990c"],"title":"Using Somatic Mutation Data to Test Tumors for Clonal Relatedness.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS836"}

However, the standard method for estimating variance components in LMMs-the restricted maximum likelihood estimation method (REML)-suffers from several important drawbacks: REML requires individual-level genotypes and phenotypes from all samples in the study, is computationally slow, and produces downward-biased estimates in case control studies. To remedy these drawbacks, we present an alternative framework for variance component estimation, which we refer to as MQS. MQS is based on the method of moments (MoM) and the minimal norm quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE) criterion, and brings two seemingly unrelated methods-the renowned Haseman-Elston (HE) regression and the recent LD score regression (LDSC)-into the same unified statistical framework. With this new framework, we provide an alternative but mathematically equivalent form of HE that allows for the use of summary statistics. We provide an exact estimation form of LDSC to yield unbiased and statistically more efficient estimates. A key feature of our method is its ability to pair marginal z-scores computed using all samples with SNP correlation information computed using a small random subset of individuals (or individuals from a proper reference panel), while capable of producing estimates that can be almost as accurate as if both quantities are computed using the full data. As a result, our method produces unbiased and statistically efficient estimates, and makes use of summary statistics, while it is computationally efficient for large data sets. Using simulations and applications to 37 phenotypes from 8 real data sets, we illustrate the benefits of our method for estimating and partitioning SNP heritability in population studies as well as for heritability estimation in family studies. Our method is implemented in the GEMMA software package, freely available at www.xzlab.org/software.html.","inCitations":["abcc3fbd961b10deb57b95021de56bacadc2425b","3b909c34bc656f2992b86de40043419954123a48","560b8e10cc199f0b67fe114872589161e8e5e290","8755c3bbd10a35796a6565df049d91b15eaed7bd","5eb02cfcf08495ba88722d1feb61f2fc2cbf0cf3","5eb5d8f397180f528c71d7694f76b18096bfacc0","9c135577d628a25e6da2d639dcd1783014697d78","53f6ba367f511c9eace3a83a0c1b5e4ae0d5c3c4","a387c25310cf6c0660189bf9134fa3dd7caec499","81efb23e12089af0d7bdd26fe6ee92045fe3690e","d6d04501fe89b00725daf955dae3049783a1468b","9f9b935def1aaac336d9cb96a58bb3d99df4dfab","4e9866494f8bdb51fe95acf126d9e8df6fbf3409","a9459a778b9456386a1869049ed9e7b6bf9c71a7","9308e42df88fe94112c70b174c9c7f31e6a7b629","bf811a1ca329d5de5ac5e15af1b3dcf0ddc17a65","2a2b35c5d0efe90054483a7387f382eb6a26c973","2a6cdab9933bb1355723cc43e4e42f945d1ed2d4","c1c3f1cb7f09b782b83b0ad3cd4844ddacc7e4c8","8144a2091756c96ab9d400e9b9563a297533e2ca","d7b26a3d7b8496a440ae84e242067115700b4e71","678dcc77fd2b412e328df71c2065e4138d6cfd1f","e9d7e5e6093ada19088a28b1f0745dd520824f5c","cb1c94eb3d594654d77d29af87027334c3edbf18","af911a99c72093fcd8458d0bbde042d42ac5a6b3","26cd7fecfeffccdd5f3dd00e74bb2b7844414606","408643bb0931b23b0bfd3a02e7bb99abe127b6ea","e42db234c460be435437fe980b06b1bfff454e4f","40bd5780af022727f9a5f4c954e3dfffb5626149","75cf44c0ab05e4fe5b11f35143574e8931be8fc3","4bd54391c91998098a4f7d3ce89d5775e8ab00ac","aefdf6761cde0ef3ade4ae3345407fe398d451cd","3e4c1fcaaa435406c80703634b806bdad379a620","b8b477810a656ab81fe7f09454a7df23c402ea56","6d2822adc512a8d41f022117bb2db431ea2c7bf4","37c85dffa4415925c13d29f4d72bc62375ff8fd2","a12e353c8f863cdb3d600fef62168718eade57d0","02c9b3e936bb45578eb6886989131ae8f31ca6bc","b8fdd2db413659381f1301b6d0283dd100fb5489","8a6ad2d70320b5611ee94648b4b71bcba1e70400","fb20c86cf3755ea7d9e0d0fac10317c497b4beaa","ba5ddc0ac2f4fe72d5255e493b2cf02bea01025f","82dca3d0694f080f632e821ce596b38fbdc0df3c","a33a32aa7832bf63c06670aad8bdf3dae41b4467"],"title":"A Unified Framework for Variance Component Estimation with Summary Statistics in Genome-wide Association Studies.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1052"}

Consequently, many conclusions based on normal theory methods are suspect. In this paper, we develop test statistics that can be correctly applied to the normal theory maximum likelihood estimator. We propose three new asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) test statistics that technically must yield improved behaviour in samples of realistic size, and use Monte Carlo methods to study their actual finite sample behaviour. Results indicate that there exists an ADF test statistic that also performs quite well in finite sample situations. Our analysis shows that various forms of ADF test statistics are sensitive to model degrees of freedom rather than to model complexity. A new index is proposed for evaluating whether a rescaled statistic will be robust. Recommendations are given regarding the application of each test statistic.","inCitations":["c8b7e6d47152fedc23f77050dcdaf135071e817d","4395d2cc63b0ac508a24d9488a7454ee23e8648f","977d30042cedb11dbe5cf2399aa024f629ebb4da","5789e7531c5826c2782991c40892c7acdebf8389","8714bf764c6fb28f806f13e63d55cbc27769054a","ecda3e5089996cccb1509a84f0af4f265caca4cc","0111c0b20044abeddd853e80aaa82b47154737f9","ea147f7c98f5b8e82793558b81b5f9aad74f5193","2dafdcc9587e92be3bef0a91d9caf11b14733767","e0b45222989f581d0fe6e9d8e772ba2fd146aa64","a429a194bb05f581d1f721595b6529dfd352730a","852aab7b4d8db572105f6b08d70d829407b31b88","002d6623a263900ba4807b21122769b52486d877","2dd9701bed94952c8b6035d2b2b18d56ebcbaa06","05f1bb8fd342722bb087fe4739532efc60e41c92","ae5c838e1935fb2bcef392a303c9cce0a1a3d9c9","bba3bab8bfd8640c25b15aadd3421a10f692f49e","d253cf7054dcaa9ff0d1743abe4866a18c3d696d","a85f00149747a01d8239c61dfc1b820223a5d0bf","c95a5fa1c1ded4131d0fe5b3178cf3f9b05301a1","da9b27b0ae0aa74bf943cdc237bedbf7dcc3d855","a28b19476edd9106699b03d5fae95a4c84b37b8f","3beffe8ba5916c82253849bae3dcb376a2b7d8ae","454396b71f91c441643a1efeb5bc36cd842808ec","3fe222956447ed16ffc124e3192caefc5ca34b49","899218f4641c178c3e07567ba1931dc2c1de7b00","e507eea020c154c3cf7f2b88cc89bd51e8c6308b","ff1760042a97af05b17cb983f355cb426644a062","8cecbba06b41704b80c5f59bedc2ab96e4d8790f","faf63349439c31171633d6a975902ca8cd27c7fe","3410310c8c8802d21d2ce62187f6cbeec2496c0d","89533c37bfde3f714ef6ef2fd2ac4ab0ce811907","c6ee3ea473c6617fd84267b16958490084a08342","f4bf97fc10610e03107d8e7adeab520cac5d4fa5","22d5e861cb5e1b554d3538fc4fb0120b022430bb","27cc61de98d89ee4c2cd517f04b08bdc4cbe61a1","ced58c49d72c72789c6a0b3a839a018fa1aee2e0","f7425b65810ad9fbeec0bde4379684502e35af65","8b76dd604abef25e4a78e88e602105fab62b8459","851948c91bc26e0a8027801fd4947068a2de083b","3e56faa767a326abd34270d445bf25b12a43ffb8","678e3d57b9d3b47f1bec5ae074a8fadf093c1486","35a5ca7303b72ba674c18a965bac1d63f947b4b2","53bee0858170dc871eb452fdfa2fb2d040a5ba0a","d0f238d1748602d9ddf196d823773393867273ea","d26cd85f4275088722753b30bdd4b551d3c89b84","343b0cfd18c24d55c814c72e88afde389db92abc","c6630f05bd757073871dda25a1d05fdebe337599","236f151ba111c689c58b2ad400f50199c7e08e29","fd733040c449de100b95a0bce879f20b2ef5e839","f4536abec3178ac0415969b61e63412b8312628b","749a21e3f7607b4360114e5e42b6bcd99a010b46","84aa667a38580c75651305501b2e501773619302","dd5e1f5ab70ff2f9b77c87ec46e16c0d8118eb58","e65820645aa40b7a05aa05ae31b4150b8fca0696","9235322dd3bf687764a5ce125a07277b45462f63","9d6a2510e61e0b8c1b680cb5eea189cbb8f062d7","7743c7da998a2f5becfaf1a06e8974a8acbc5016","895d7c94a92f1e43dff1c5866945499e22a7f13e","fef0106c1756538c8b11a3b82779d28eb14f1290","eb001538dc453bc5825a16b267d05d32763cd4f2","346baacf62d0ebae78959698e6a7492ebd29e0a9","f1822289eab74e473c4fdbca0cb0ab66a8a62a25","f563ff6075973938b258e5f4758747be9ee715b4","3ba8281ff0098690b152189f656f377fa1ba0722","19c445aac6fffee696a32fe4d6a6064e9f0de6f8","a1823f4d185be4c28cd336a4597a3671081a5998","f66ac36afe4faaf243b3c208f668c36fed37e2eb","59b9f6ffda0ded339bdc1910d6c88db5be1b5656","b704e4269e9fc5b1a632c6ebc60a910ab95fc1e4","8b732766055208d81f0f433d05796f926aec3ec0","46092ac8ab9f662dc5d9d5c0d2a93f0a786bd884","5bae89a09822e0ffa52e7b20dbb31158e9203129","049367cee5e5bda73bb9ba588b19048a814c542b","4ff86d4dbf7eda196289abd98b7882af15071117","85ed31aa796d240836c79547f892d5d72bc2d349","169a76c94747a1b713c008d6e26eb492d9d9f691","7bab721460269905945a45065d43827b00fa7cc3","3c2d528245c0e00d2ad1d80ea08cdc8f6b9df480","359140d6d40afa730349e675a95c09b811fe73c0","cf737e8418917517e3663dddeed31dace8475cda","daa3ddbbcb9ab41582650f175be600523f92be40","6055e1be940216afad07801e2a15deb1cd7d9e2a","ff7eda661f81830d2b0ae2520ef3f22a2840dbcb","d4eb3134ac16c9e4c0b6e9739441bb24c3e808d3","2b255587946d75dc0081ce80ac2359c3944bb739","5a9785aceed5ce8bf2997af31ce5756b7ca94a8a","13466664ebd1a3b6a29fee7676af5c4ebf7264ee","129b33e79e028f80a4e88a863a8ced7f756265e0","00ca70b29e3f23b74f7c438cc00a84edbb4039ec","9811175eec40a0e5eb15620cd1bcfab6de73d4a2","383333f4b5abdaf4f67e09343548f7e0930524cb","67123f08ba8ffa75126cb68fd6860e5d34494815","227c65ec8dc043a62b3315ad0fd79b4600254698"],"title":"Normal theory based test statistics in structural equation modelling.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1998.tb00682.x"}

For many markers, genotypes cannot be imputed with complete certainty, and the uncertainty needs to be taken into account when testing for association with a given phenotype. In this paper, we compare currently available methods for testing association between uncertain genotypes and quantitative traits. We show that some previously described methods offer poor control of the false-positive rate (FPR), and that satisfactory performance of these methods is obtained only by using ad hoc filtering rules or by using a harsh transformation of the trait under study. We propose new methods that are based on exact maximum likelihood estimation and use a mixture model to accommodate nonnormal trait distributions when necessary. The new methods adequately control the FPR and also have equal or better power compared to all previously described methods. We provide a fast software implementation of all the methods studied here; our new method requires computation time of less than one computer-day for a typical genome-wide scan, with 2.5 M single nucleotide polymorphisms and 5000 individuals.","inCitations":["3dd4b0b01c380dd1791cf08cfd3060c0e727e20e","4dcf3500e1b6a6177be6f4f05ec122432d7a1c83","95cf36e2cd57179fb3392f8c296737c566ca0cb4","ca12afe7a33cfcd6f4a43656453ad7a3b0c881a6","1d6fc9f69f0ba51871922634ae7c0004e8162d2d","468f060fb560e8e9e79334f1349f595ac53f7d42","ffbb56ee197086833f5355ce7ada74b14b81a22c","7b342f09fbf08bb711904fd97953d8b94051860a","ae4513eb11fa98319cc89a6b3d9707670fbe49fb","c744b40b2b129099ad08527677774ac501bbee5b","584deed29310984b003e911ed0af5c8d910f865c","ff3f0a23ebca7e937817a3aca456c5aa33d9b1f1","18b07e5bf3382f2c2e74f95e20571f32c07553b0","3195ae2f86db4c90674f83fc311714aa4df7c296","8855ce9584bf84ebed70fc5a6a63f195d861edc8","cf0267443ba80b2a0b277078904787c605c6f7dc","8ffe27e1ceffa2f398fd6972257aa547a1f28e77","6b4db25c9979b390bdb346f228e07563e00c6118","693309d7d636d55af3e11ab81bae3b6190714c64","7b5ac8de8165882e56ee5fc245b652ffcb7adace","efc3dd4fb0fcfb9d9f49877ad6ebc7125b7cba11","4e1dede72fa13d3787564d29f5bb6142e1b53d57","90165a3cf047a6cfe40dfd3eac2796ed4b108489","4140293dbf6554e77579e3bbdd6bce18369c7589","ac2b3ea8a4eded06f6fd69c72b63b78fe0156d6e","a7dd2a1073bf31dae3508afa3fd66c110dec5b48","602128ccf4cfbcb2c448473e8275888153d36ab3","63cc546a6463e7bc90ae54a2c9cf8c79a0cdd1fd","c83b84d1ea904c6a63d81759ee3c69a76542b4ca","310aa50c22095cc587e565e48962d34a1529a29a"],"title":"Methods for testing association between uncertain genotypes and quantitative traits.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq039"}

However, the development of a sufficiently general asymptotic theory for nonlinear spatial models has been hampered by a lack of relevant central limit theorems (CLTs), uniform laws of large numbers (ULLNs) and pointwise laws of large numbers (LLNs). These limit theorems form the essential building blocks towards developing the asymptotic theory of M-estimators, including maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments estimators. The paper establishes a CLT, ULLN, and LLN for spatial processes or random fields that should be applicable to a broad range of data processes.","inCitations":["f0ed3c684318d4186c6817c2c40ae2a6a129700d","f88ea335a02d9a6c5f86887203f08669d11b4510","a00078ccf855c4f791d6c23b072874a2d9d593e1","edb329e1ede837262f245563681f9dc8bddc20dd","b47ac4002d2b636a523b325d7ffc4498ca739b5b","66afbbe3f4aa7051d36f547fa1d29d43244451f8","c2b18cb54b5b401b2baa48dd0436da5b4e2fef10","6d161d951f8a3c7ba44d76900818004892fd999c","9517907eb9e62b2d6cfa2ac2fe6a16cf9bcb04fd","89626ff0a87bf17364f7c3a2d15474c302d6e103","eb2557d4363eed5a6f211a67165bafc0c7f2b7cb","353d6bd7ae8a74f24bd7ec4c98b8e7741de9c010","82a0007801eec3b057496ccc4a0fc786e1ba004d","170e1497e1d1a1d9cefc421db921214cfef6ec8e","ad4c73219d3cac3e05e77bf9373d818a0ebf31de","9c3338fda1027cf5c869a80c25dd80246c5dc3e9","b23c2021c6ab7e8ed7171be3d64686b2cef0e2d9","b8fa1686e6e344c9ae6aad1dd9e878249d85c4ac","74643434d26f94958d40d77ad91509ee65963914","9e5eda45ace1bb6cfc59e180aec965e038d02546","f69f606ada0cde18b3154c31392681ff02cd23c2","24552cb5648186aa0cf737b3c9c2fabea9de7be9","751181ca6de4684afa345243c37575a3dcd7c4d3","3022511867d9487bb493d552a1240b48b7a3afdd","39fc536fb9d84991f88ad4e120fd4b0c8d7b8a21","40619950ab30651686b82785f7bbfb0ee874bddb","82a4448683329f1197f04a8232e4c006af9e0620","990b18d9aa31561862512839daad1cc0ed7ab8ec","2a024537d012c96244e8e03185ccc31543d4bed4","28670c3d92cc3c0ae5aa35571373e58a5a420697","9729b99974be6cccecf7d78c823da21fa4daef05","55931ffd524f6ea394824610903f6689999f4ccb","0635b895b8e4456d53aaeec016268afa976b42d7","589dfcb8e78d73eda26a90ebed04cd96b38870c6","42ce33c5f0754ad8a7b99755692b997ff6058805","6b86c667aa58d61c3ebd796d38a095957e3fdc2d","977676be7ec13396c1e09484bc831acc36631bf2","d694a77063c17812538213daa31055e533554521","24e17258864b39a8fa91a906c11c691c3fff871c","36aa5510c787972ae80e2e82091760b4977985b0","e6421b2c5a96ff6e3e99032ebc3c505ca7ed57d3","499a55ef4e76883da48ef47e211f3482003b7f7e","89951d98511805cb3583e14dca5032a7e22460c0","ffe5d676e36f386b436b2ec1dd4ee3c4288b36d1","6031d010a8f48578a18b631b9cdd416070331a28","2ee631afee16922318f6bfac356357023834f761","2a1db35d3201fe4a2abac054320174a7b45180d9","31cced8d5e473cb6310f88f5c6eb535ca9f691b7","4f714d4b148a1d1abd77971c5e3e9a635ae1f0e1","d1dfbf9ba038901f6e1ad1c4898bc83cc405c9f9","9b79811e0f7d4ccf9ad493967f34169d663c3302","169fdceb057b381b4efe06d71df71f5c0db11dd0","e47910dd1c653520297884f1c9d0bae689df973c","beec937945457f1624b7bf240efc05e30d862397","763e6b1ed6a48e842981d97dbaf528b328f73625","982ed1e39a65672c9b098596a843eca88778f81c","ec25019940621124a3c108dfd45f1d44bba754ff","e5f07dce15f1ad726373f782f14289210e3c2f3f","6c49e009bf169dccf5450fbd153b2e636a43e405","11e5c4cc1fd3776ce355903cecf567f11279e3cd","65d1bde66f05fcb18cdde6a7bd2763a5dc59ed96","daab340351dd74e44c7ac74edd879515b3d08f2d","a6b2c2cea25f77e6e393f11d30038d3e0e197c8d","75e7d846ccb51eb82b71e742c71eebd08db626d4","63e0ad60fc7a2e71014f554198e371f7d869d64d","6bf3e3db2a9f13b5e850d663096a0164617628dc"],"title":"Central Limit Theorems and Uniform Laws of Large Numbers for Arrays of Random Fields.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2009.02.009"}

Two estimating methods for the controls based on maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood are proposed. The bias and mean squared error performances are studied by simulation.

In a subset of the whole cohort, a surrogate variable is available for the true unobserved exposure variable. The surrogate variable satisfies the classical measurement error model, but it may not have repeated measurements. In addition to the surrogate variables that are available among the subjects in the calibration sample, we assume that there is an instrumental variable (IV) that is available for all study subjects. An IV is correlated with the unobserved true exposure variable and hence can be useful in the estimation of the regression coefficients. We propose a robust best linear estimator that uses all the available data, which is the most efficient among a class of consistent estimators. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal under very weak distributional assumptions. For Poisson or linear regression, the proposed estimator is consistent even if the measurement error from the surrogate or IV is heteroscedastic. Finite-sample performance of the proposed estimator is examined and compared with other estimators via intensive simulation studies. The proposed method and other methods are applied to a bladder cancer case-control study.","inCitations":["9d1b0c0edc1d66037813956e45db22750843a6f2","1e13b6fe2bea1b14e0c7083eceb92063550d1763"],"title":"Robust best linear estimation for regression analysis using surrogate and instrumental variables.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr051"}

Simulations illustrate the performance of C-TMLE relative to current competitors such as the augmented inverse probability of treatment weighted estimator that relies on an external non-collaborative estimator of the treatment mechanism, and inefficient estimation procedures including propensity score matching and standard inverse probability of treatment weighting. C-TMLE is also applied to the estimation of the covariate-adjusted marginal effect of individual HIV mutations on resistance to the anti-retroviral drug lopinavir. The influence curve of the C-TMLE is used to establish asymptotically valid statistical inference.
