Furthermore, we introduce a semiparametric least squares ROC estimator and apply the estimator to the separation curve method. We derive a sandwich estimator for the covariance matrix of the semiparametric estimator. We illustrate the application of our separation curve method through two real life examples.","inCitations":["b805c973be3bea45c94394666cd585e1cf1863ff"],"title":"A semiparametric separation curve approach for comparing correlated ROC data from multiple markers.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2012.663303"}

In order to correct the bias present in the maximum likelihood estimates and the problem of nonconvergence, the penalized maximum likelihood estimator is considered. Simulations compare the fit and empirical confidence levels of inferences made from the maximum likelihood and penalized maximum likelihood based models.","inCitations":["5bea2cc5df7a7413593e5f0626d04bc2f7a8a37b","6b1c1f09935d63bfe3c720bcfdbc9031fde3f65a"],"title":"Bias reduction in logistic dose-response models.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003703306"}

To facilitate a general asymptotic inference theory relevant to economic applications, this paper first extends the notion of near-epoch dependent (NED) processes used in the time series literature to random fields. The class of processes that is NED on, say, an α-mixing process, is shown to be closed under infinite transformations, and thus accommodates models with spatial dynamics. This would generally not be the case for the smaller class of α-mixing processes. The paper then derives a central limit theorem and law of large numbers for NED random fields. These limit theorems allow for fairly general forms of heterogeneity including asymptotically unbounded moments, and accommodate arrays of random fields on unevenly spaced lattices. The limit theorems are employed to establish consistency and asymptotic normality of GMM estimators. These results provide a basis for inference in a wide range of models with spatial dependence.","inCitations":["c3fef8ab49c037e1c80160039ec4ffba6557ad06","d694a77063c17812538213daa31055e533554521","999787f75582225f3f8f9b2bc67e481b02d4e9ea","daab340351dd74e44c7ac74edd879515b3d08f2d","7b4e1c9b893438709180574e995c1f0d06873fdb","31cced8d5e473cb6310f88f5c6eb535ca9f691b7","d73f0c6d33d91b640e1d43f07e6d95bdb8f3f8d8","a6b2c2cea25f77e6e393f11d30038d3e0e197c8d","4b399dfd3fd8c00000a427f101c4a6193bb9f7cf","9b79811e0f7d4ccf9ad493967f34169d663c3302","945118c74756525ee5773bf7ed6a66fd1e0941d0","95bcac6aec4faf8997ecbb44dac53623ec61f911","d396e903ca246931976b72a0e703fc2aa0c542ef","beec937945457f1624b7bf240efc05e30d862397","770f999bf54203a5eb1e7c97563db43e6cd24111","6bf3e3db2a9f13b5e850d663096a0164617628dc","88b19c9322eb696283d29fea3d9516e06b16dc9e","982ed1e39a65672c9b098596a843eca88778f81c","24552cb5648186aa0cf737b3c9c2fabea9de7be9","89951d98511805cb3583e14dca5032a7e22460c0","6d161d951f8a3c7ba44d76900818004892fd999c","9517907eb9e62b2d6cfa2ac2fe6a16cf9bcb04fd","89626ff0a87bf17364f7c3a2d15474c302d6e103","82a0007801eec3b057496ccc4a0fc786e1ba004d","0324979900ff08eab0a4fd9c4b5bf6d7543bb2c8","d1dfbf9ba038901f6e1ad1c4898bc83cc405c9f9","5af732b9f18e358b09fa14901e3b0fa921e13acc","353d6bd7ae8a74f24bd7ec4c98b8e7741de9c010","8c1e552c2e97cead89469df3c97fa01c7e7f2be7","56395fa1e8fe739e0565ff689205103500d1ae91","bee7351652cca6f153eb7fbd67bcbb291283ae8f","763e6b1ed6a48e842981d97dbaf528b328f73625","28670c3d92cc3c0ae5aa35571373e58a5a420697","55931ffd524f6ea394824610903f6689999f4ccb","ec25019940621124a3c108dfd45f1d44bba754ff","e5f07dce15f1ad726373f782f14289210e3c2f3f","11e5c4cc1fd3776ce355903cecf567f11279e3cd","82a4448683329f1197f04a8232e4c006af9e0620","dfbba40d4dea136df564123289c02a47915af138","2ee631afee16922318f6bfac356357023834f761"],"title":"On Spatial Processes and Asymptotic Inference under Near-Epoch Dependence.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2012.05.022"}

Results are presented of a substantial simulation study conducted to investigate the influence of some of these factors on the safety and the accuracy of the procedure with a view toward providing general guidance for investigators conducting such studies. The Bayesian procedures evaluated use logistic regression to model the two responses, which are both assumed to be binary.

Extensive attention has been directed to analysis methods to adjust for the bias induced by missing observations. There is relatively little work on investigating the effects of covariate measurement error on estimation of the response parameters, especially on simultaneously accounting for the biases induced by both missing values and mismeasured covariates. It is not clear what the impact of ignoring measurement error is when analyzing longitudinal data with both missing observations and error-prone covariates. In this article, we study the effects of covariate measurement error on estimation of the response parameters for longitudinal studies. We develop an inference method that adjusts for the biases induced by measurement error as well as by missingness. The proposed method does not require the full specification of the distribution of the response vector but only requires modeling its mean and variance structures. Furthermore, the proposed method employs the so-called functional modeling strategy to handle the covariate process, with the distribution of covariates left unspecified. These features, plus the simplicity of implementation, make the proposed method very attractive. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic properties for the resulting estimators. With the proposed method, we conduct sensitivity analyses on a cohort data set arising from the Framingham Heart Study. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the impact of ignoring covariate measurement error and to assess the performance of the proposed method.","inCitations":["0c2f49a240b096a324831ce64f411366623fb6fa","30aad921a25b5da7efcbf29bd15c0f9b5838e15f","73c415f9026d9489a84a2ac016374f386ffac703","eaa46393ab48395c1ae54429acdf49a85002e96c","52becd745e63e624b1638c39ff40cb5bbacb2c36","286feb9e33822ce59542cc7b0ec283693048e2c9","a759af566e9e6b333edcb48b8235a1aad7c3e5c0","3b55462c9e7077daf62d24431b60b6255586753b","f6cbc2fd131a1c7c6d175e69f010fafaf1346e58","f3bf2df14264c9f4726e344499f8acecd5d560b2","29b4efa01708b84b5c133adf800ae57d3cd9cb76","f84de791a989f3c2f993f2045fd4c34251c55669","19eb242f363fde4f81f446bc9c0a65cd911823ef","7bc31fda685794b76937985600aae6bb91f468e3","90f52933b7e5f39dbd0c393fe392accce2a2b676"],"title":"A simulation-based marginal method for longitudinal data with dropout and mismeasured covariates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm054"}

Dynamic, exploratory and interactive visualization of multivariate data, without preprocessing by dimensionality reduction, remains a nearly insurmountable challenge. The Statistics Online Computational Resource (www.SOCR.ucla.edu) provides portable online aids for probability and statistics education, technology-based instruction and statistical computing. We have developed a new Java-based infrastructure, SOCR Motion Charts, for discovery-based exploratory analysis of multivariate data. This interactive data visualization tool enables the visualization of high-dimensional longitudinal data. SOCR Motion Charts allows mapping of ordinal, nominal and quantitative variables onto time, 2D axes, size, colors, glyphs and appearance characteristics, which facilitates the interactive display of multidimensional data. We validated this new visualization paradigm using several publicly available multivariate datasets including Ice-Thickness, Housing Prices, Consumer Price Index, and California Ozone Data. SOCR Motion Charts is designed using object-oriented programming, implemented as a Java Web-applet and is available to the entire community on the web at www.socr.ucla.edu/SOCR_MotionCharts. It can be used as an instructional tool for rendering and interrogating high-dimensional data in the classroom, as well as a research tool for exploratory data analysis.","inCitations":["bbf808c2b03b02055d8142387a775eeb9f5eda62","21ff69e7f256278aed6733d6d2a356fd2e62dfe2","69cde7952f074eb4e766bec16f75dba037f98e7e","214971ef14eb2e993cd66d1975171ba873cfd2d0","df75426aa1894c26a5092bef659c59a8bd6eebf9","21a2a0282e53da98ff7043aa77f0a976961ea078","24def99cd8fe961cf3155a4e73b9a13cdbc98977","906ad1c5828adf93773c6106cdf1f94d55c30b26","b0fc6a707daf2a9a6e85e23120baf4257dd729ab","9d656f056c97ed25b8186455d85c61eeedb7b6fc","8a790d631225a3f9a88c7e2b8a6e28b6bf694eaf","9fd5e7dd064c0dcb7d18f6240fb1ceca9a69bf03","d7cc12834412ef0150e99a632de087dded8528ce","e582ff524db700f8c94be471804a95d74eefee73","ad2730576e0693a281ae6ceca19af3ee781b191f","7ffe6b495c6409effdf9a972df4a60f474210357","f55b57e7ac3b8214313193e16a078e8d149676f6"],"title":"SOCR Motion Charts: An Efficient, Open-Source, Interactive and Dynamic Applet for Visualizing Longitudinal Multivariate Data.","doi":"10.1080/10691898.2010.11889581"}

In this manuscript, we particularly focus on a J-shaped dose-response relationship for binary cancer responses. We propose and examine two new flexible models for testing the hypothesis of hormesis in a Bayesian framework. The first model is parametric and enhances the flexibility of modeling a hormetic zone by using a non-linear predictor in a multistage model. The second model is non-parametric and allows multiple model specifications, weighting the contribution of each model via Bayesian model averaging (BMA). Simulation studies show that the non-parametric modeling approach with BMA provides robust sensitivity and specificity for detecting hormesis relative to the parametric approach, regardless of the shape of a hormetic zone.","inCitations":["15b789da18157a135c316e64ea87288410cf2c2a","cf7b8477c55e970aa586dccb26bac66e8e372289"],"title":"Inference for the existence of hormetic dose-response relationships in toxicology studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw004"}

This can make the interpretation of trial results difficult, because observed differences between treatment groups may be a function of the covariates and not necessarily because of the treatments themselves. We propose a method for balancing the distribution of covariate strata across treatment arms within RAR. The method uses odds ratios to modify global RAR probabilities to obtain stratum-specific modified RAR probabilities. We provide illustrative examples and a simple simulation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy for maintaining covariate balance. The proposed method is straightforward to implement and applicable to any type of RAR method or outcome.","inCitations":["f1d6c3ef2efd082d425e0bf75332030e128021ec","0b7bbbe02b3ec27d8300439202dbfe11e31e52a2"],"title":"Balanced covariates with response adaptive randomization.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1803"}

A new type of double-penalized least squares is formulated, using the smoothing spline to estimate the nonparametric part and applying a shrinkage penalty on parametric components to achieve model parsimony. Theoretically we show that, with proper choices of the smoothing and regularization parameters, the proposed procedure can be as efficient as the oracle estimator (Fan and Li, 2001). We also study the asymptotic properties of the estimator when the number of parametric effects diverges with the sample size. Frequentist and Bayesian estimates of the covariance and confidence intervals are derived for the estimators. One great advantage of this procedure is its linear mixed model (LMM) representation, which greatly facilitates its implementation by using standard statistical software. Furthermore, the LMM framework enables one to treat the smoothing parameter as a variance component and hence conveniently estimate it together with other regression coefficients. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed procedure.","inCitations":["edb4692b1ee0d6f8442164f2f29ff081baf5ebda","744dfda286cd7b99e7565bb4247aa6611dd3b45a","62db1a664c414c47077d465b4ab95f439efeda90","b1460f36c137668a319a6ebb6450cc1240a442c0","012c1bdf4ef40df7851342892c39107ce61fcd8e","84d31738f1cca851e0005a45eecb54563ca6d609","a1427c650e2e11afd8b065cd191ee036f0255797","b007b24fb64374f35b30f59cb1ec24627e7d3ce1","648f4d043ac6658d115c0eec5b5d835c22351f63","57e5884dc8c8914866c9d1fea95f89fa8b89a26f","2ff4c45bf26539d0776547e432dd7865f3eedb5a"],"title":"Automatic model selection for partially linear models","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2009.06.009"}

The justification of using variance adjusted non-inferiority or equivalence margin is for the consideration that a larger margin should be used with large measurement variability. However, under the null hypothesis, the test statistic does not follow a t-distribution or any well-known distribution even when the measurement is normally distributed. In this study, we investigate asymptotic tests for testing the equivalence hypothesis. We apply the Wald test statistic and construct three Wald tests that differ in their estimates of variances. These estimates of variances include the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimate (UMVUE), and the constrained maximum likelihood estimate (CMLE). We evaluate the performance of these three tests in terms of type I error rate control and power using simulations under a variety of settings. Our empirical results show that the asymptotic normalized tests are conservative in most settings, while the Wald tests based on ML- and UMVU-method could produce inflated significance levels when group sizes are unequal. However, the Wald test based on CML-method provides an improvement in power over the other two Wald tests for medium and small sample size studies.","inCitations":["ab3c9f169e0dbbe937c7290cd4189df1c4b75792","2487edd533c3f5bcf0b314157f83b588d107b0d5","00b17200b92771aaa132d2d95165e3e8552e9ba3"],"title":"Wald tests for variance-adjusted equivalence assessment with normal endpoints.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1265542"}

Here, we focus on longitudinal cluster randomized clinical trials (cluster-RCT) that aim to test the hypothesis that an intervention has an effect on the rate of change in the outcome over time. In this setting, the cluster-RCT assumes a three-level hierarchical data structure in which subjects are nested within a higher level unit such as clinics and are evaluated for outcome repeatedly over the study period. Furthermore, the subject-specific slopes can be modeled in terms of fixed or random coefficients in a mixed-effects linear model. Closed-form sample size formulas for testing the preceding hypothesis have been developed under an assumption of no attrition. In this article, we propose closed-form approximate samples size determinations with anticipated attrition rates by modifying those existing sample size formulas. With extensive simulations, we examine performances of the modified formulas under three attrition mechanisms: attrition completely at random, attrition at random, and attrition not at random. In conclusion, the proposed modification is very effective under fixed-slope models but yields biased, perhaps substantially so, statistical power under random slope models.","inCitations":["b9bd27fb3ffd8bad37c03c45f8916309887da09d","b82cb0c484be6ba62a2ffd6ff6c3fb7e7201c1bc","52ecac6de4c9052dea33b55efa9f6992aa2aaf6c","4933921f527c32f758d850ed119c3ef605c7a3f1","1c3472b4b13ea0d6f5244c750b7ac204f44df22f"],"title":"Impact of subject attrition on sample size determinations for longitudinal cluster randomized clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.888442"}

A lack of association is usually established by demonstrating a non-significant relationship with a traditional test (e.g., Pearson's r). However, for logical as well as statistical reasons, such conclusions are problematic. In this paper, we discuss and compare the empirical Type I error and power rates of three lack of association tests. The results indicate that large, sometimes very large, sample sizes are required for the test statistics to be appropriate. What is especially problematic is that the required sample sizes may exceed what is practically feasible for the conditions that are expected to be common among researchers in psychology. This paper highlights the importance of using available lack of association tests, instead of traditional tests of association, for demonstrating the independence of variables, and qualifies the conditions under which these tests are appropriate.","inCitations":["2cef07f790e4c8a660e11ead745157f06092a340","f10f87cdda77ebbf0c3d3a555923ac5cc2fe2df9","81386d28416dcac2621abcbc73726161c6780748","6fb42b440a476b0483d4514560ecac2f9c6d56d4","7ef3de505e1865c25d18c8fa8fae9ddde92d6dc3","3a6384bc3d093c6b132552584710e3222bddfddb","1e8bc41782584da0e6a5970bfb6f46085838a283","4e9e8bcb04fb50df6297e99bdd916bac9cda04ff","3590ee5cd78891e1cdc95429ba3bedd0ae433704"],"title":"Detecting a lack of association: an equivalence testing approach.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X475853"}

Although many such approaches have been developed and used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with complex traits or diseases, few are able to detect gene-gene interactions among different SNPs. Genetic interactions, also known as epistasis, have been recognized to play a pivotal role in contributing to the genetic variation of phenotypic traits. However, because of an extremely large number of SNP-SNP combinations in GWAS, the model dimensionality can quickly become so overwhelming that no prevailing variable selection methods are capable of handling this problem. In this paper, we present a statistical framework for characterizing main genetic effects and epistatic interactions in a GWAS study. Specifically, we first propose a two-stage sure independence screening (TS-SIS) procedure and generate a pool of candidate SNPs and interactions, which serve as predictors to explain and predict the phenotypes of a complex trait. We also propose a rates adjusted thresholding estimation (RATE) approach to determine the size of the reduced model selected by an independence screening. Regularization regression methods, such as LASSO or SCAD, are then applied to further identify important genetic effects. Simulation studies show that the TS-SIS procedure is computationally efficient and has an outstanding finite sample performance in selecting potential SNPs as well as gene-gene interactions. We apply the proposed framework to analyze an ultrahigh-dimensional GWAS data set from the Framingham Heart Study, and select 23 active SNPs and 24 active epistatic interactions for the body mass index variation. It shows the capability of our procedure to resolve the complexity of genetic control.","inCitations":["0a3219659badf728f86e3cec84e577ee869fd379","48e9d4a12964b034db14b8173c0b9e8acfdd7342","5dd642cdbee4943154d4fe6ba3fcccbc74018943","dc2b9dcec1ebb70b04d85f929eddb5ded2601b80","8dee1d79543f14f081fba59c12c3f0cdb49de707","d85d65f463eeed69d78dfc7ee5448c3f7190ba09","3d9d6f0baa1405c9a157227410581b6892d90a25","59213d5d0e0d7308630889d7314b1fd716aa8654","cb341935050be9c69fce2c8e4f7e63b712660752","72a655aadb41c6d1170793926d4bd223674f0ed1","2a777190f4f794895e5f738a13ac0b02dd289278","e229037576d7c7b7b38063953b51f84a7f21f64a","f3cf6a5e7387d795f19a460a84905b873a3822de","5fb70cc7ebe7c62fcf29775d788de09d5720df50","72d4c99321ac0f64227b1d6e225fd858311e0154","290c08a34045ae37f74a843e158235590a694324","1d260fe9daa235b5b28587926a4598929016345d"],"title":"A Fast Algorithm for Detecting Gene-gene Interactions in Genome-wide Association Studies.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS771"}

We extend the multiple comparison procedures-modeling (MCP-Mod) approach into a two-stage design. In each stage, we use the same set of candidate dose-response models and test for a dose-response relationship or proof of concept (PoC) via model-associated statistics. The stage-wise test results are then combined to establish \"global\" PoC using a conditional error function. Our simulation studies showed good and more robust power in our design method compared to conventional and fixed designs.","inCitations":["a953796d04406e7f2b0f16dad1647276fe20eca7"],"title":"An adaptive two-stage dose-response design method for establishing proof of concept.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.813519"}

This methodology rests on the definition of a crossbasis, a bi-dimensional functional space expressed by the combination of two sets of basis functions, which specify the relationships in the dimensions of predictor and lags, respectively. This framework is implemented in the R package dlnm, which provides functions to perform the broad range of models within the DLNM family and then to help interpret the results, with an emphasis on graphical representation.

There is no easy way to adjust for covariates in a non-inferiority study for which the margin is defined as a risk difference. Adjustment is straightforward on the logit scale, but reviews of clinical studies suggest that the analysis is more often conducted on the more interpretable risk-difference scale. We examined four methods that allow for adjustment on the risk-difference scale: stratified analysis with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) weights, binomial regression with an identity link, the use of a Taylor approximation to convert results from the logit to the risk-difference scale and converting the risk-difference margin to the odds-ratio scale. These methods were compared using simulated data based on trials in HIV. We found that the CMH had the best trade-off between increased efficiency in the presence of predictive covariates and problems in analysis at extreme response rates.
