Intact groups (called 'clusters') of subjects are randomized to receive different interventions and all subjects within a cluster receive the same intervention. In cluster randomized trials, a cluster is the unit of randomization and a subject is the unit of analysis. Variation in cluster sizes can affect the sample size estimate or the power of the study. Guittet et al. (2006) investigated the impact of an imbalance in cluster size on the power of trials with continuous outcomes through simulations. In this paper, we examine the impact of cluster size variation and intracluster correlation on the power of the study for binary outcomes through simulations. Because the sample size formula for cluster randomization trials is based on a large sample approximation, we evaluate the performance of the sample size formula with small sample sizes through simulation. Simulation study findings show that the sample size formula (m(p)) accounting for unequal cluster sizes yields empirical powers closer to the nominal power than the sample size formula (m(a)) for the average cluster size method. The differences in sample size estimates and empirical powers between m(a) and m(p) get smaller as the imbalance in cluster sizes gets smaller.","inCitations":["bd2aa53846bd7e86d804c8a981198cc01d18a069","4933921f527c32f758d850ed119c3ef605c7a3f1","e0ecc24c7a3105a60ede1b8b1c61fe8443d23776"],"title":"Effect of imbalance and intracluster correlation coefficient in cluster randomized trials with binary outcomes","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.09.007"}

We find that an observation with a very large Cook's distance based on the sample influence curve may not necessarily exert an excessive influence on the factor loadings pattern but may change the ordering of the factors.

We propose a quantile regression model to analyze current status data, because it does not require distributional assumptions and the coefficients can be interpreted as direct regression effects on the distribution of failure time in the original time scale. Our model assumes that the conditional quantile of failure time is a linear function of covariates. We assume conditional independence between the failure time and observation time. An M-estimator is developed for parameter estimation which is computed using the concave-convex procedure and its confidence intervals are constructed using a subsampling method. Asymptotic properties for the estimator are derived and proven using modern empirical process theory. The small sample performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via simulation studies. Finally, we apply the proposed method to analyze data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.","inCitations":["15f24b4503f6ec3c9417cabcfc11517ac8ead015","5c6180527b9383119dbe2d57e16cde311f6612c1"],"title":"Quantile Regression Models for Current Status Data.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2016.06.001"}

Because often there is no need to parametrically smooth multistage trial data (in contrast to observational data for adaptive strategies), it is possible to establish direct connections among different methodological approaches. We show by algebraic proof that the maximum likelihood (ML) and optimal semiparametric (SP) estimators of the population mean of the outcome of a treatment policy and its standard error are equal under certain experimental conditions. This result is used to develop a unified and efficient approach to design and inference for multistage trials of policies that adapt treatment according to discrete responses. We derive a sample size formula expressed in terms of a parametric version of the optimal SP population variance. Nonparametric (sample-based) ML estimation performed well in simulation studies, in terms of achieved power, for scenarios most likely to occur in real studies, even though sample sizes were based on the parametric formula. ML outperformed the SP estimator; differences in achieved power predominately reflected differences in their estimates of the population mean (rather than estimated standard errors). Neither methodology could mitigate the potential for overestimated sample sizes when strong nonlinearity was purposely simulated for certain discrete outcomes; however, such departures from linearity may not be an issue for many clinical contexts that make evaluation of competitive treatment policies meaningful.","inCitations":["9ab65c6d194955418a7f4db0b86742a5ba844c11","80c83da55101e8a8353276c089e9e71589a89312","12191d9e950cf7af684c5acae58794e41988fd6b","cb616b1a5f3dbc234f6cc98b1979c5bed13b7061","59e7551f5b6ffde5cc9f8f2e29bd3c6fae1f4155","f3334c777c5095f93a123bf09f49e45a21fd93ce","98611a1eddb27a2043fd0e09bd18a8fd5d9a0791","b5040503b48d34f90048f5ad621660da7302b47a","cef3f1c914982ee79522e3ae7d26131d026ac90d","a988d14409810485f763c2fe6e215a6b6ebc08cb","88a81da5e82359cab83a69c59a70b848858e3230"],"title":"Efficient design and inference for multistage randomized trials of individualized treatment policies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr016"}

Most existing methods seek to borrow information based on the degree of homogeneity of estimated response rates across all baskets. In reality, an investigational product may only demonstrate activity for a subset of baskets, and the degree of activity may vary across the subset. A key benefit of our Bayesian model averaging approach is that it explicitly accounts for the possibility that any subset of baskets may have similar activity and that some may not. Our proposed approach performs inference on the basket-specific response rates by averaging over the complete model space for the response rates, which can include thousands of models. We present results that demonstrate that this computationally feasible Bayesian approach performs favorably compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, even when held to stringent requirements regarding false positive rates.","inCitations":["8484be05b4d17eb466f6b1098e559f82127daabf","defaa701eddee7513d6d64b1af8b587deaaad9b8"],"title":"Bayesian adaptive basket trial design using model averaging.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz014"}

If these fine-grained skills can be identified, a sharpened focus on learning and remediation can be achieved. The focus here is on how to detect when learning has taken place for a particular attribute and efficiently guide a student through a sequence of items to ultimately attain mastery of all attributes while administering as few items as possible. This can be seen as a problem in sequential change-point detection for which there is a long history and a well-developed literature. Though some ad hoc rules for determining learning may be used, such as stopping after M consecutive items have been successfully answered, more efficient methods that are optimal under various conditions are available. The CUSUM, Shiryaev-Roberts and Shiryaev procedures can dramatically reduce the time required to detect learning while maintaining rigorous Type I error control, and they are studied in this context through simulation.

In our commentary, we discuss the role of principal stratification in causal inference, describing why we view the principal stratification framework as useful for addressing causal inference problems where causal estimands are defined in terms of intermediate outcomes. We focus on mediation analysis and principal stratification analysis, showing that they generally involve different causal estimands and answer different questions. We argue that even when principal stratification may not answer the causal questions of primary interest, it can be a preliminary analysis of the data to assess the plausibility of identifying assumptions. We also discuss the use of principal stratification to address issues of surrogate outcomes. Our discussion stresses that a principal stratification analysis should account for all the principal strata and evaluate the distributions of potential outcomes in each of the principal strata. To this end, we view a Bayesian analysis particularly suited for drawing inference on principal strata membership and principal strata effects.","inCitations":["74e2f8d403eb661314f69d721bfd1ff158607eaf","2507eaa62fa1f09e2a69cd409f0c07ee06015ec8","139a48f0ac4731e75973c2c973209892c88fe669","8f5c257cd64a413a2e0e17ae1f008310bc7b8799","33585bb8106967332c464cf1eaaf23bdbde7ef55","3d3b985dd6555283c072727d4e62272c7105a46d","d1225abcfc1948811c58e8e8c05f9e4ef664e0b3","8b7e92f6c393ef2508d7fa90a73a417a6766ce56","4f08f4786039e82b0157282ab24b3164c91a9a3a","ef84b89febe2b7f986d1c42e0d3f0715b9d588e1","39fc44f692b890bad80f273e28a182e05e27d900","b2cf4ef5b4fabc28ca4638fe3a0853e78b59a6cf"],"title":"A Refreshing Account of Principal Stratification","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1380"}

Inclusion probability methods are more efficient than the conditional logistic approach of Thomas; however, the epidemiology research community has not accepted the methods as a replacement of the Thomas' method. This paper promotes the inverse probability weighting method originally proposed by Samuelsen (1997) in combination with an approximate jackknife standard error that can be easily computed using existing software. Simulation studies demonstrate that this approach yields valid type 1 errors and greater powers than the conditional logistic approach in nested case-control designs across various sample sizes and magnitudes of the hazard ratios. A generalization of the method is also made to incorporate additional matching and the stratified Cox model. The proposed method is illustrated with data from a cohort of children with Wilm's tumor to study the association between histological signatures and relapses.","inCitations":["8ea7ba113265d1c06903a1b6e2dfbb27e2b6f0d3","75ccea3d95853266dbb79362dfc55ac6bdbee0c3"],"title":"Analysis of Nested Case-Control Study Designs: Revisiting the Inverse Probability Weighting Method.","doi":"10.5351/CSAM.2013.20.6.455"}

Background fluorescence, whether attributable to nonspecific binding or other sources, is an important component of noise. The decision to subtract fluorescence surrounding spots of hybridization from spot fluorescence has been controversial, with no clear criteria for determining circumstances that may favor, or disfavor, background subtraction. While it is generally accepted that subtracting background reduces bias but increases variance in the estimates of the ratios of interest, no formal analysis of the bias-variance trade off of background subtraction has been undertaken. In this paper, we use simulation to systematically examine the bias-variance trade off under a variety of possible experimental conditions. Our simulation is based on data obtained from 2 self versus self microarray experiments and is free of distributional assumptions. Our results identify factors that are important for determining whether to background subtract, including the correlation of foreground to background intensity ratios. Using these results, we develop recommendations for diagnostic visualizations that can help decisions about background subtraction.","inCitations":["cd29d39ca5aa49deeaf6624e3a50d1ecc047ebcf","b8df7591a05a53bff1ed74174ce40d0684766d21","42af173915c7b4652d4615cb9a3ab4ae1207bbcc","075ce2886cb1d6d83417e48adcd2c8713eb1ddf9","ea934fd83699f1feba0179f5d5b4b207cfabfefd","5dd53a60a280d3cbc5e84c4919f0a184e089ae54","24699e21baba95030ec3fee98fa4fb9a011b4509","2ac7c3c8510b6072f52f62f54023c47dc9e33fe8","99e9360162411391fd3ef1f7465570c5228c4e32","e1fe28e14640cc97fc157b661e11757fcb1c1d35","7d3704b9b68004c8ea1049f2c6c48181861aa770","58efbf9ab0c289985dc845b7de015f746f4df471","eca2e6fed5856db810e849ebaf419cdf0241316e","c0b508082c8f7b64fb10b7570d455518dd845e30","38a29d65ff04cce132733896820d3f1b67d0ee53","ff8ab6f027e4e0929722d8749e42ba7085d4e93c","fcd647a79610888aea38d9c338b1bccc8b73047b","e1c2925f01b82448179782a9e00c51170740f5a8","176026081a83e147140cb095d73208991331c2e0"],"title":"When should one subtract background fluorescence in 2-color microarrays?","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl041"}

Empirical Bayes allows borrowing information across genes and can automatically adjust for multiple testing and selection bias. However, the standard empirical Bayes model can perform poorly if the assumed working prior deviates from the true prior. This paper proposes a new rank-conditioned inference in which the shrinkage and confidence intervals are based on the distribution of the error conditioned on rank of the data. Our approach is in contrast to a Bayesian posterior, which conditions on the data themselves. The new method is almost as efficient as standard Bayesian methods when the working prior is close to the true prior, and it is much more robust when the working prior is not close. In addition, it allows a more accurate (but also more complex) non-parametric estimate of the prior to be easily incorporated, resulting in improved inference. The new method's prior robustness is demonstrated via simulation experiments. Application to a breast cancer gene expression microarray dataset is presented. Our R package rank.Shrinkage provides a ready-to-use implementation of the proposed methodology.","inCitations":["9848605507850714fa11d4769c4012895d010d20","bab7d45203db902b0299a3e819d7107cb12a2a6e","3e52b68b6d34bc5d28144ad3ea8de5acfd5660b3","ebf1f38a6d1ac14518257ab85a5d1ce929382d44"],"title":"Prior robust empirical Bayes inference for large-scale data by conditioning on rank with application to microarray data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt026"}

HIV1-RNA levels in successfully treated patients tend to follow a standard pattern of biphasic decline-a rapid early decline in viral load, followed by a period of slower decline or a steady level. Fitting nonlinear regression models to these patterns of declining HIV1-RNA levels can be of value in comparing different treatment regimes and in predicting treatment outcome. Simple exponential-decline models can give an adequate fit to the typical pattern of HIV1-RNA decline, but we have explored the extent to which curve-fitting can be improved by using two novel nonlinear model forms. Specifically, we describe the fitting of multiple polyexponential and quasipolynomial forms to longitudinal HIV1-RNA plasma data collected in two recent trials of the novel anti-HIV1 treatment Fuzeon. We comment on the practicalities of fitting these nonlinear models, and compare the fit using various criteria.","inCitations":["862d8be8f27ff7ce90a92a1700254292bb15ceb5"],"title":"Multiple polyexponentials and quasipolynomials as empirical nonlinear regression models: a case study with HIV viral load data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400500508788"}

In particular, we develop a simple method based on generalized linear mixture models for handling nonignorable dropouts for a variety of discrete and continuous outcomes. Statistical inference for the model parameters is based on a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach (Liang and Zeger, 1986). The proposed method yields estimates of the model parameters that are valid when nonresponse is nonignorable under a variety of assumptions concerning the dropout process. Furthermore, the proposed method can be implemented using widely available statistical software. Finally, an example using data from a clinical trial of contracepting women is used to illustrate the methodology.","inCitations":["08c5c33c033bf9665feb1b0c1d83a04be6e6a614","e7ffbcf891eed7e4cef0ff07bbf6664af6c610d9","322425379c5397bb76bdec790e0fcde09c5feeb1","bdc7bfad0c29768574cc95bf98aac582d365a184","c8321f5d621cac417b879491597453e37831c610","90f52933b7e5f39dbd0c393fe392accce2a2b676","ddc779c0554035abf298690d594cfb6cd5a128bb","6bb8428fb0c4581d77f25dd9a75d4a944252a183","38a30c386d06d0c31dd5f076cae392498c350442","12ec8bde5b1d46607bbd86fe401498986d7b8614","1b8539b2b0cdcecc1f6c690721bbafb66abca328","d58823a4e48073a1f45998689862ae7e732fbb21","a1bb81fa975521d3d6167f7882cdbb6475f53c14","f15aec11ebda503e25ec65e5695a8ff6592e8e62","f512e4da7c62eae45117884369de020e802fb754","a72876d64b425d7f95ae4e499df4a77193ceaa18","8e6332a776c15412fca8a186e641b8ffc4510344","61266d6c782bbfff56e069b449f3bfee288592b3","2faa6ca47e49f8762241eb628b476d0880a7a762","5583b5c22b1831c4f21b80639e8e797fcfc5c857","36023de04216f4190a6e21f446a0187b3a2cbbe0","37c024fdde760fd22293c9721e2216e1222a923f","eaf70e7de69423f9f3e11bafcac6d915ae825114","c79e310568437f0a7d5fcf898ffc77b5d043d64c","bea3b636b93a9a3473436025e6d2e9df19f5e825","18ca93b6922c31ab436c34d8a293aca0df7ada19","894d47968641fbb721f81998e3625b8f535c4216","43f271494af73813c1fc49103deddcb9f20a8286","efd8be537bd7f4d7d0be36de93bb4e24625ff45b","c11150da34526ab9a121246cc47b0965f546d1a5","e0b11cfcc06c261d271759e603a7fd2dc260aa97","50fc93fd4d220e15bade99293a6aca8fe70e932a","223f55b9d9fb721ebbf8c28aaef299b10be13f9b","bf188e201288e1c7a0d61a32abdd41ea78aa913f","56061cf8f982c5e8c61d8d247e26bb52a6f5360b","30aad921a25b5da7efcbf29bd15c0f9b5838e15f","5d90e48a55c9c41ef549acfdbcc907392942377c","f55f099e37ded6da9ae130f399beb1cfa85b5208","0f0345a9470b690810e4819602681f5a44bbe7e2"],"title":"Generalized linear mixture models for handling nonignorable dropouts in longitudinal studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.2.141"}

Consider a Gaussian mixture model, where the null distribution is known to be normal but both null parameters-the mean and the variance-are unknown. We address the problem with a method based on Fourier transformation. The Fourier approach was first studied by Jin and Cai [9], which focuses on the scenario where any non-null effect has either the same or a larger variance than that of the null effects. In this paper, we review the main ideas in [9], and propose a generalized Fourier approach to tackle the problem under another scenario: any non-null effect has a larger mean than that of the null effects, but no constraint is imposed on the variance. This approach and that in [9] complement with each other: each approach is successful in a wide class of situations where the other fails. Also, we extend the Fourier approach to estimate the proportion of non-null effects. The proposed procedures perform well both in theory and on simulated data.","inCitations":["a1b9ddd5cfc6532761c6f693878ac148c0f2b191","bc0003eff7c1b6ccfd95d33758fc174b290122eb"],"title":"A Generalized Fourier Approach to Estimating the Null Parameters and Proportion of Nonnull Effects in Large-scale Multiple Testing.","doi":""}

For many applications, one often needs to estimate multiple conditional quantile functions of the response variable given covariates. Although one can estimate multiple quantiles separately, it is of great interest to estimate them simultaneously. One advantage of simultaneous estimation is that multiple quantiles can share strength among them to gain better estimation accuracy than individually estimated quantile functions. Another important advantage of joint estimation is the feasibility of incorporating simultaneous non-crossing constraints of QR functions. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based multiple QR estimation technique, namely simultaneous non-crossing quantile regression (SNQR). We use kernel representations for QR functions and apply constraints on the kernel coefficients to avoid crossing. Both unregularised and regularised SNQR techniques are considered. Asymptotic properties such as asymptotic normality of linear SNQR and oracle properties of the sparse linear SNQR are developed. Our numerical results demonstrate the competitive performance of our SNQR over the original individual QR estimation.","inCitations":["30e423483799bc9e89ba0a30aacd02b6869696d3","fc4097dad008b7f701189904c73c522c7b3925f2","7f836ada7f93000c1e3f6a5e5092485ecb7a2080","946a7e50fd3198a53b38759ba2aeac1c22d421e5","d089a290e5e7c903617d53c919a20c0c094dd6cf","115a9a508aa4d9f3efbe44857fd9841106c2693d","6615eb972a5cf7d0ed5981dff9cd4bdeb16f1455","ebe31e5f33218aade70770296a86d75a1fae42f8","2eea713f8325d37566566e5e86f4c5bcaf4a12f6","10072d57ef6bc3f506754cefefd45f6ff2f0f3b0","d25c12de2307fc882d12f4aaec494c12aeab6628","93e4ca7ef01b7943f43a731fc16924daefa95c94","f355b550ababa3992bb446fbe25ee9c48c58b462","b2b0ba964daabb3f6c7a647e665a22d11c443722","9f47dcd4379d8ac2c4f0b23e2daeeb7347cd54de","c8da0fb07aa24c6200658738c7330a73cc9b6323","11f132af9c40a7e869633e20f1e63cd0086c7a77","213fefb8809c9c42628182189814c708d4f66cd5"],"title":"Simultaneous multiple non-crossing quantile regression estimation using kernel constraints.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2010.537336"}

Methods are proposed for use when another treatment arm is to be added mid-study to an ongoing clinical trial. Monte Carlo simulation was used to compare potential analytical approaches for pairwise comparisons through a difference in means in independent normal populations including (1) a linear model adjusting for the design change (stage effect), (2) pooling data across the stages, or (3) the use of an adaptive combination test. In the presence of intra-stage correlation (or a non-ignorable fixed stage effect), simply pooling the data will result in a loss of power and will inflate the type I error rate. The linear model approach is more powerful, but the adaptive methods allow for flexibility (re-estimating sample size). The flexibility to add a treatment arm to an ongoing trial may result in cost savings as treatments that become ready for testing can be added to ongoing studies.","inCitations":["ef841f1c9b47fabfb3bd5ff67f3684ef717e2f26","17dc5a05bbc0d015db51dc9b73fdd64933e241db","04f58c6dda2807f796ada43de524fae47ea5816f","d1b6c2e43933900e1268358f558d6a62ca09bae2","369022af1435a22462ebcb831a2f36788ac15712"],"title":"Flexible analytical methods for adding a treatment arm mid-study to an ongoing clinical trial.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.528103"}

In case of a linear mixed effects regression, it is examined, starting from a flexible function of the costs involved and allowing for subject dropout, which design is most efficient in estimating this effect. For no carry-over, the AB/BA cross-over design is most efficient as long as the dropout rate at the second measurement does not exceed 2ρ/(1 + ρ), ρ being the intraclass correlation. For steady-state carry-over, depending on the costs involved, the dropout rate and ρ, either a parallel design or an AA/BB design is most efficient. For types of carry-over that allow for self carry-over, interest is in the direct treatment effect plus the self carry-over effect, with either an AA/BB or Balaam's design being most efficient. In case of insufficient knowledge on the dropout rate or ρ, a maximin strategy is devised: choose the design that minimizes the maximum variance of the treatment estimator.

This estimation problem is addressed in a statistical model for the data distribution that is nonparametric, beyond possible knowledge about the treatment and censoring mechanisms. We propose data adaptive estimators of this optimal dynamic regime which are defined by sequential loss-based learning under both the blip function and weighted classification frameworks. Rather than a priori selecting an estimation framework and algorithm, we propose combining estimators from both frameworks using a super-learning based cross-validation selector that seeks to minimize an appropriate cross-validated risk. The resulting selector is guaranteed to asymptotically perform as well as the best convex combination of candidate algorithms in terms of loss-based dissimilarity under conditions. We offer simulation results to support our theoretical findings.","inCitations":["25ec378cebbc9d608d38ec891999b37791fdd689","d87a547d3cd6ecd31773e2a1ecff29494b159b6b","45f223c8bdbeee57ba5aa56d460b862e17964c13","7cd0ff116044e00bfd6fb275aa701619a7916799","a5a341eebc045665dd5eb7abaa5c5cc34992404d","fa14b07295b80a88833ff5281b2bb067ed44ecdc","a1850837382a77318e73ee093bf3912bc40f937b","81d07e2be139ef4c342320831bf965267c64ee93","abb8112e9bbf80be174212d6e920863d6d7df560","2c7cc63e1263ab5deef9f227a254049e537b05f8","a843250f1637997204b03b27d5ca00992364dc8e","1fb99eb350c1ae182b949d965a248c238491b398","5cdd187dfdcaef62c847256af7807495805bca05","525c7afb291823946be7ded9efce3a8df3c7b36c","255266eca3f2611e1e702d425e24d3d0dc8c6481","db0c1b316aa03b1bcc0be9698dae97243b685a5e","93b213fd336e6d308d1234fd717cc3629283238f","ee07ca60a0619f2f0cb72c7fc690c14a6598801e","fcedc83519202a20064bd078d8dfbb3e97b10cbe","f345afc1837b1a358bc0578d467ef683c74179aa","7ac31b4f1bc36eea267f2b4f6068f3226a7c6067","5baa13dd85966d81f05fb781bae444fc175722b6","9ba6e7f676c270249aea38d105621e38bdee7e3b","1d2203c77620e43c0aa050a1b8ed4c229304dfd9","3f02b7b25fa9dc9e033beabd54a9916228e934c9","30eef96540a101e076d94e02651cb5c197059409","79c7788ceac3f43412ba163db995d80202c9ac4a","d2a56c13463b021d5f6af4f9f93aa3a5a31cf82d","daabcb9863668c0c10b73628c34201b7e640c988"],"title":"Super-Learning of an Optimal Dynamic Treatment Rule","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0052"}

In this approach, we impute the missing data assuming a latent class imputation model and we use likelihood methods to analyze the imputed data. Via extensive simulations, we study its statistical properties and make comparisons with complete case analysis, multiple imputation, saturated log-linear multiple imputation and the Expectation- Maximization approach under seven missing data mechanisms (including missing completely at random, missing at random and not missing at random). These methods are compared with respect to bias, asymptotic standard error, type I error, and 95% coverage probabilities of parameter estimates. Simulations show that, under many missingness scenarios, latent class multiple imputation performs favorably when jointly considering these criteria. A data example from a matched case-control study of the association between multiple myeloma and polymorphisms of the Inter-Leukin 6 genes is considered.","inCitations":["5973fcc15d600c178476bb7baeb17aedbd301a30","fa763994ac085b7f843609b4161ccba227ed39d7","354818cebfb297113f40a3bf172e22da72d23f18","a5340046eefbed1bc0bcf5070783a881ed803f87","48c092f202e0e9de8123f8f65a9b4f87f2aa973b","a8c666318453407810a6421c2c3ef0507ab72533","6b02436e61a8d7f77e0efb9c838215d6147b75de","e139399c52f9c6f26b14469bdb206aeb21175044","fefaa383f995adbdd506922aa6960210019b90c8","db5898a04a3f0bab8fa25e93bf8e73bc724f6d7f","cd0a75fe5068ba2324838f55554cb4453c82a3a7","e1064a15b12784b93e756c4170ccf2256715b6b9","2737cc9e946555a61f253ac2931d04bc43bc82aa","bc5631a933f2799862f4ef9877d5baa931c24128","c0eada53536b83c8bc900ee096a7e52b206ae4ef","946389156db3fe3b6626ffb6a8d7bb13cf4f8295","353d0b9496add4fcdc55b0b20d1b5f6943101337","e7ed3904704e2fb7b030e4a08110fdd0eba63271","46ab565c801256fa5ccb3d1736b08479bbdf9f40","c1b29d6220e9d7d7a244e3c60f020204b66326bd","e073bba760097e85d07cdc33797bf7c3470a2632","2423724a68038dae7e92a6ca768d16f874625926","acc70b0df79e571fe1427333f14098e51f34b891"],"title":"Latent class based multiple imputation approach for missing categorical data.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2010.04.020"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2006,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The proportional hazards (PH) model is routinely employed for the analysis of time-to-event data in medical research when it is required to assess the effect of an intervention in the presence of covariates. The assumption of PH required for the PH approach may not hold, especially in circumstances where the effect of the intervention is to delay or accelerate the onset of an event rather than to reduce or increase the overall proportion of subjects who observe the event through time. If the assumption of PH is violated, the results from a PH model will be difficult to generalize to situations where the length of follow-up is different to that used in the analysis. It is also difficult to translate the results into the effect upon the expected median duration of illness for a patient in a clinical setting. The accelerated failure time (AFT) approach is an alternative strategy for the analysis of time-to-event data and can be suitable even when hazards are not proportional and this family of models contains a certain form of PH as a special case. The framework can allow for different forms of the hazard function and may provide a closer description of the data in certain circumstances. In addition, the results of the AFT model may be easier to interpret and more relevant to clinicians, as they can be directly translated into expected reduction or prolongation of the median time to event, unlike the hazard ratio. We recommend that consideration is given to an AFT modelling approach in the analysis of time-to-event data in medical research.","inCitations":["bd4a66df678ed9fd74260a84364f19b4db04f394","6d7d2b3f3e9a67d9bd70bd2f8630e9f64cc033da","7699e1ee4051ba7dc35584885ea74c89196c7142","814823361fc32676525c73332b08a5ef71c8b5c7","270a9b867f1e0b8840f4c0034d5538c85eb893d4","ba95301851a8a92ba52efc95dc66c66fd825678a","9be53d63424179138771c708c525f8a665e6ee51","99fec3765c9c9eacbacacdb5df6c846714412384","799c2eaae8b4bdae13ef788d89a040377bc365b9","33160ccaf1d991e8f6778b9ced8d7311329a10b4","7636eb13c01bd0be9c29ce1c93db636ff53b6007","c549363833edccc2e3240120d790dfd0b2e4860e","0489b37cc42fd42eaa9743570ed1b42b16368450","253b1eacbf9e5335b629f63792134c8cbfb1ba91","d34fcc7f867935b1414498449a01ce7fe676bb91","987558efb9bb3bbfbd467d10e28d1077f82e8051","9303715c0a9cd7bad83669bc04f2dc5a3b72b8a9","f6f4a1205cee5106411d7d362c150128920e8dbc","f0d90a6a7ea1a3bbac279cde1723562beec2e397","4d9cb36e9b5c01f2de81667ef61c81a0bedea396","bbd07ea56a3d867fe9a639438701a690462edde1","58d82fb7e185db0ccde8d9b2e5db0e0258a0df8f","91b60682462654c5f3403fa20e738fd0e67e0e83","95c48effbfb1fa0e7a32c571bf5a68e17590dd9f","fa45a08798ad95e111836191fe0d181999521793","5a031d3ca7fe9d0366620c519d5c7557bc38eeca","e140bcbd87caafcb618b9b19b7403d6a77aae3ba","f453ddc2131a5e5265701d564a09a7d0f7a28a0e","4cb3df964a114b741094a03aaebe22fa2f3d0c82","d74e3fd33ad7f8e485c4e8df13f6cb7c24f32aa3","247565e22abab4a63fa63d2df3d568c219332077","388f9aa035c0873b77ef7a02a86dfd35edf6ba1e","b3325f9be0df6ac33e1036e2c409d7ee29ab0c69","911325ed9aea9641f55f03eadd92c6f5bc2a88f7"],"title":"Comparing proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models: an application in influenza.","doi":"10.1002/pst.213"}

In this paper we develop an efficient algorithm to identify the optimal two-stage randomized multinomial designs in phase II oncology clinical trials comparing a treatment arm to a control arm. The proposed algorithm substantially reduces the computation intensity via an approximation method. Some other techniques are also used to further improve its efficiency. Examples show that the proposed algorithm has more than a 90% reduction in computation time while having an acceptably low approximation error. This may enhance usage of the optimal two-stage multinomial design in clinical trials and also make it feasible to extend the design to more complicated scenarios.","inCitations":["ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb"],"title":"An efficient algorithm to determine the optimal two-stage randomized multinomial designs in oncology clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903541097"}

However, sometimes it is not possible to satisfy this condition or to check whether it is satisfied. In these cases, the test statistics and p-values of each stage may be dependent. In this paper we investigate the type I error of two-stage adaptive designs when the test statistics from the stages are assumed to be bivariate normal. Analytical considerations are performed under the restriction that the conditional error function is constant in the continuation region. We show that the decisions can become conservative as well as anticonservative, depending on the design parameters and on the sign of the correlation coefficient. Further, we discuss properties and advantages of this design and compare it with the Bauer-Köhne method.","inCitations":["5284ad72302ae9c7b59644ccdb02d81d4bd831c2","9398a20346ce835bb98c2e1ec63f1cdd524f51c6","c7cad80ec6c8155698e529a75d0d9ee1ae948db7","db6b09daa34ba71d0c54ba2703c69adc94ecee1d","00f4a8852aba5c6479ee2db42a01732e9eaec3ec","7a678129c347ffce95883952c7558fc4a1f0c3cb","13c0a69e874932892988237a02fb2673a4d6e6f3"],"title":"Two-stage adaptive designs with correlated test statistics.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200062282"}

CQIV allows estimates to vary across the conditional expenditure distribution, relaxes traditional censored model assumptions, and addresses endogeneity with an instrumental variable. My instrumental variable strategy uses a family member's injury to induce variation in an individual's own price. Across the conditional deciles of the expenditure distribution, I find elasticities that vary from -0.76 to -1.49, which are an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates.","inCitations":["58189223c64f9932de3669f706fcd03929e6167c","455c8239a1062f41249e65a7ce941d7744916697","32e4f0c26cee0307b173101b107b4be22354f0a1","3153515aefb98f89d4f8fc2bd5601c3868bb856f","a527ef24fc450ca16255c2ecf904cbc11675d16a","7cdccbfa90974806f6dac78b3d14a5c7e10a288d","dc8ad1a4211d48895e965e63f5168db6dca73990","3439039417e5f1aa2c70117d1b423036e950ac3f","90f9981f6fb23d11f5397d954287b200eb5a3870","0910e8237028f78944b83c2eb86a75f2758f310f","69716bac0ac56c2536bad23f77bf975d01f3674f","5800a2e2e57a6af590e82556ba1694241fcd96a7","57131ab30a5de1654808f953d62b500e503823a8","abfb405fa18485b43947724f63b37abb1d5d9cca","91694acfc6ce6708254ec000f750ced97dc1ff76","07b98d4fd1854c950a6ba696fd05c06137284ed0","d19779c067b662161b58be9a4ca69898f2247365","3f78b388e6fee077a6c6d043dc2d8d8972f20a70","543173d943a92ece7f53e36c52319023e771a51a","82de1feaddb4ac90e8fb0caa5514c109e33c99a4","471c6084928c461412c641ffa166bae882095bbd","2bd2e156d7229b10194796f6a88b1c36f3942c36","56e07fd5d7e7e4f4a276477e620e3b8e719c5f7c","e7dc0977a496ac9562ee4b859e1869e8b2448703","cbb43da5897ff959981ed5fe12d75c3143450979","64125d138230c3bbc5e29551f9d2255f9931475c","bb25fc63e5a077498ceaff098c962100641ce2ad","ff2de41f5d1711ea4bcebf9493ebdb0f9f73398f","40c289980eab12e7cdabe21fc0489c37bc099573","8886072c1a2b26aa5ec33f6d0f63a8284be99332","79da107dcd9085e855ced62c4241395d5b198545","35c2b3163f37283c1eb35c79e51d7c18d6b69940","c209b8001de9905418f4f9db79cd012e1b2e362c","fd6b9b1c9a4b87bbe7b25715f5fdaa85041495ca","a66d39432dfb5c5a5aca5d69594d520a42e26215","e6b376df9a36720811c6af4431bdf2bca983bfb8","70a8cefc5b00384ccf50ec40026b28b8c1d872e0","821d2328cb044cb043a208758c94d4920e24ea97","87ac402e59c3296e911c7389f08c1a3e60e658c3","bbe5763b0dc2c13bb1fce881a1d9ce6f43facfe1","7d77f4a13f7c8b39ca8af3c02e4107500a337521","f3f98ce3eb844c639c1944b36fd5db698c9665dc","5cff9be13d212f6d24cf74d2fc5c4e37e3231e68","9a014dd7035ac7aef535b9841ad108893ae931e0","369fbd62cc087e651e1b889726f7d39053db1f23","8dba4d474613c00009bf23dad4c378be1394badd","711379c0f1015d907b1fbad4619574a8d6aa4f73","72162ce7315afb8c2cf522503d76cfa3b152d08a","274b9ccd46d028cb14e935062b514ef2d501eab2","f15e1eb809204278d21f7ce4addca51e99c9f284","da8d986407779c9ebec9b17bd557cf55dab2a3aa","46e47030915e2e26668cdd9865263ea89e05299f"],"title":"Censored Quantile Instrumental Variable Estimates of the Price Elasticity of Expenditure on Medical Care.","doi":"10.1080/07350015.2015.1004072"}

Its advantages and utilities are well known. However, recent studies have raised questions about the accuracy of the commonly used moment-based meta-analytic methods in general and for rare binary outcomes in particular. The issue is further complicated for studies with heterogeneous effect sizes. Likelihood-based mixed-effects modeling provides an alternative to moment-based methods such as inverse-variance weighted fixed- and random-effects estimators. In this article, we compare and contrast different mixed-effect modeling strategies in the context of meta-analysis. Their performance in estimation and testing of overall effect and heterogeneity are evaluated when combining results from studies with a binary outcome. Models that allow heterogeneity in both baseline rate and treatment effect across studies have low type I and type II error rates, and their estimates are the least biased among the models considered.","inCitations":["7419376551c20fc88f524cb08e32aff7d348b90f"],"title":"Likelihood-Based Random-Effect Meta-Analysis of Binary Events.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.920348"}

For many interventions, the possibility of confounding due to the effects of health-care seeking behavior on disease ascertainment remains a concern. The test-negative design, a variant of the case-control method, was introduced to mitigate this issue in the assessment of the efficacy of influenza vaccination (measured at an individual level) on influenza infection. Here, we introduce a cluster-randomized test-negative design that includes randomization of the intervention at a group level. We propose several methods for estimation and inference regarding the relative risk (RR). The inferential methods considered are based on the randomization distribution induced by permuting intervention assignment across two sets of randomly selected clusters. The motivating example is a current study of the efficacy of randomized releases of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to reduce the incidence of dengue in Yogyakarta City, Indonesia. Estimation and inference techniques are assessed through a simulation study.","inCitations":["57fe6047b73bc8b23cb5df7b0fbfd639fb75b79d","6c7dca901e862d9385cf25b04ec871a09daafd7a"],"title":"Analysis of cluster-randomized test-negative designs: cluster-level methods.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy005"}

A novel object identification algorithm was developed in Java to locate immune and cancer cells in images of immunohistochemically-stained lymph node tissue from a recent study published by Kohrt et al. (2005). The algorithms are also showing promise in other domains. The success of the method depends heavily on the use of color, the relative homogeneity of object appearance and on interactivity. As is often the case in segmentation, an algorithm specifically tailored to the application works better than using broader methods that work passably well on any problem. Our main innovation is the interactive feature extraction from color images. We also enable the user to improve the classification with an interactive visualization system. This is then coupled with the statistical learning algorithms and intensive feedback from the user over many classification-correction iterations, resulting in a highly accurate and user-friendly solution. The system ultimately provides the locations of every cell recognized in the entire tissue in a text file tailored to be easily imported into R (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996; R Development Core Team 2009) for further statistical analyses. This data is invaluable in the study of spatial and multidimensional relationships between cell populations and tumor structure.
