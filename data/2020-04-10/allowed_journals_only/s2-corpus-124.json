It has been proven that these resources can successfully improve students' learning (Dinov et al. 2008b). Being first published online in 2005, SOCR Analyses is a somewhat new component and it concentrate on data modeling for both parametric and non-parametric data analyses with graphical model diagnostics. One of the main purposes of SOCR Analyses is to facilitate statistical learning for high school and undergraduate students. As we have already implemented SOCR Distributions and Experiments, SOCR Analyses and Charts fulfill the rest of a standard statistics curricula. Currently, there are four core components of SOCR Analyses. Linear models included in SOCR Analyses are simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, one-way and two-way ANOVA. Tests for sample comparisons include t-test in the parametric category. Some examples of SOCR Analyses' in the non-parametric category are Wilcoxon rank sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman's test, Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and Fligner-Killeen test. Hypothesis testing models include contingency table, Friedman's test and Fisher's exact test. The last component of Analyses is a utility for computing sample sizes for normal distribution. In this article, we present the design framework, computational implementation and the utilization of SOCR Analyses.","inCitations":["1acfdfc303342318865a5a44872cd512a546e0f2","38f422c22d6af3848629975eef9f94899a178353","e31758f26a14f95baee208a9354dfb57960d86ea","df4afc11574acb62dc9d7c6db93a59cbea138d17","3465412bd94c0156bcffcd6a6579569999c160d2","c6653617de6280e3623968043fc2e598b1c3e137","2b439d3c0cb4b1d3e8e8d7bd06b2639a3e46c37e","a7d205c3321559a7a5573d016c1b9439c0fb579e","8a790d631225a3f9a88c7e2b8a6e28b6bf694eaf","6c5a055a5dc414c88bcf20f928be0c464f3efc63","e52339d1ad6f79919cf18b3ceb8525dbc8d73c67","c5ea6d9d001cb715a7521bee8677f4b48c114580","4d771924f4f6fa14d35b9ea9a57619468c839427","c505cb9eb40b78c42445d74d794b172e4ec66e65","906ad1c5828adf93773c6106cdf1f94d55c30b26","88d6a536018c5fac614b04af0ea447c78369549d","83e6a4c970ad63e78ce6bfaf65450ce36cd7eec8","61d2ef987f35b9a773600643a648c80338e9ba1f","01d36b83272db976a6965615776a08ecd15141bd"],"title":"SOCR Analyses: Implementation and Demonstration of a New Graphical Statistics Educational Toolkit.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v030.i03"}

Confounder detection methods often compare regression coefficients obtained from \"crude\" models that exclude the possible confounder(s) and \"adjusted\" models that include the variable(s). One such method compares the relative difference in effect estimates to a cutoff of 10% with differences of at least 10% providing evidence of confounding. METHODS: In this study we derive the asymptotic distribution of the relative change in effect statistic applied to logistic regression and evaluate the sensitivity and false positive rate of the 10% cutoff method using the asymptotic distribution. We then verify the results using simulated data. RESULTS: When applied to a logistic regression models with a dichotomous outcome, exposure, and possible confounder, we found the 10% cutoff method to have an asymptotic lognormal distribution. For sample sizes of at least 300 the authors found that when confounding existed, over 80% of models had >10% changes in odds ratios. When the confounder was not associated with the outcome, the false positive rate increased as the strength of the association between the predictor and confounder increased. When the confounder and predictor were independent of one another, false positives were rare (most < 10%). CONCLUSIONS: Researchers must be aware of high false positive rates when applying change in estimate confounder detection methods to data where the exposure is associated with possible confounder variables.","inCitations":["1e41a17b018236f3239f379490ccddf2564ac176","3a33a4fbdf9dbdfb6a135f5c02954c9dc315a2cd","4fd257e7b9b957824a8156178b3c26172a578ebc","b4f7db943ab508902946d6f88d82298b80da0275","8986ab5290d2f9fa1236886d3df9944fe53d7d41","fe4f7b9b5cf1fed3654936442b0f8f13e2b18b30","6820d07c0da19ea843ed080550f06263f4ec57d8","660602a2df61d6dae0002c915e84e261fa233e26","85039bd179a984a4673b699c8e081c33c81ec7d8","00074f6ed69200c10bfa1b2ee444b8ab2ba64580","1c4310bec70ff2087c459231c1f54fca42db64fb","97d5ab53abf11e18ad77ebc852251b92fd3ac3e2","3170e49072006e73a0701637b1c8333806f0c2e2","71b947336de8f5df16ff43c33999cd6167f06540","0316649d39acdd4d4ab35f25b218d01aaf87e96b","3234ceac621283f8a1f73b5ba849f448242d1fbb","c4fc598919b81398a2cb5d7ee8decbe1f8ab6627","d2baf3e40729775622701c7af1d8422ba8d1a034"],"title":"Determining the Probability Distribution and Evaluating Sensitivity and False Positive Rate of a Confounder Detection Method Applied To Logistic Regression.","doi":"10.4172/2155-6180.1000142"}

Whole-genome sequencing provides an unbiased way of identifying all the CNVs that an individual carries. In this paper, we consider parametric modeling of the read depth (RD) data from whole-genome sequencing with the aim of identifying the CNVs, including both Poisson and negative-binomial modeling of such count data. We propose a unified approach of using a mean-matching variance stabilizing transformation to turn the relatively complicated problem of sparse segment identification for count data into a sparse segment identification problem for a sequence of Gaussian data. We apply the optimal sparse segment identification procedure to the transformed data in order to identify the CNV segments. This provides a computationally efficient approach for RD-based CNV identification. Simulation results show that this approach often results in a small number of false identifications of the CNVs and has similar or better performances in identifying the true CNVs when compared with other RD-based approaches. We demonstrate the methods using the trio data from the 1000 Genomes Project.","inCitations":["5d9fe595af7fdc6b23468654724b83c5a5095441","7ba883a32a465c6790a2ac06aed46b658db5d38f","87d73ccb95fb0e9e7c66ea924d3f3d007ee9d597","330e94b1b27c8ae5837edf15945e471177b370d6"],"title":"Parametric modeling of whole-genome sequencing data for CNV identification.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt060"}

In the presence of censoring and when covariate effects are of interest, Cox regression is the strong default, but mostly due to convenience and familiarity. When survival times are uncensored, covariate effects can be estimated as differences in mean survival through linear regression. Tobit regression can validly be performed through maximum likelihood when the censoring times are fixed (ie, known for each subject, even in cases where the outcome is observed). However, Tobit regression is generally inapplicable when the response is subject to random right censoring. We propose Tobit regression methods based on weighted maximum likelihood which are applicable to survival times subject to both fixed and random censoring times. Under the proposed approach, known right censoring is handled naturally through the Tobit model, with inverse probability of censoring weighting used to overcome random censoring. Essentially, the re-weighting data are intended to represent those that would have been observed in the absence of random censoring. We develop methods for estimating the Tobit regression parameter, then the population mean survival time. A closed form large-sample variance estimator is proposed for the regression parameter estimator, with a semiparametric bootstrap standard error estimator derived for the population mean. The proposed methods are easily implementable using standard software. Finite-sample properties are assessed through simulation. The methods are applied to a large cohort of patients wait-listed for kidney transplantation.","inCitations":["ac94f108bc1177ac6f41e29285f9c1da668604ad"],"title":"Tobit regression for modeling mean survival time using data subject to multiple sources of censoring.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1844"}

Random-effects models, sometimes called shared-parameter models or frailty models, received a lot of attention. In such models, the corresponding variance components can be employed to capture the association between the various sequences. In some cases, random effects are considered common to various sequences, perhaps up to a scaling factor; in others, there are different but correlated random effects. Even though a variety of data types has been considered in the literature, less attention has been devoted to ordinal data. For univariate longitudinal or hierarchical data, the proportional odds mixed model (POMM) is an instance of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM; Breslow and Clayton, 1993). Ordinal data are conveniently replaced by a parsimonious set of dummies, which in the longitudinal setting leads to a repeated set of dummies. When ordinal longitudinal data are part of a joint model, the complexity increases further. This is the setting considered in this paper. We formulate a random-effects based model that, in addition, allows for overdispersion. Using two case studies, it is shown that the combination of random effects to capture association with further correction for overdispersion can improve the model's fit considerably and that the resulting models allow to answer research questions that could not be addressed otherwise. Parameters can be estimated in a fairly straightforward way, using the SAS procedure NLMIXED.","inCitations":["d6069e8f6fd8a247c5b2f292a4d0f2fbed39a9d3","c908f6b22638c7964ffcd791524bc64a7b79e3f2","017871a75918e824732504d98cf7fb3eb44a9b30","66893b99bd9c25d556d2a9a77a3a596bceb90a90","027ab6e9259f63e51292d62031da4bb5fd54ee37"],"title":"Mixed models approaches for joint modeling of different types of responses.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1052487"}

Spatial misalignment of the exposure and response variables can bias the estimation of health risk, and the magnitude of this bias depends on the spatial variation of the exposure of interest. In air pollution epidemiology, there is an increasing focus on estimating the health effects of the chemical components of particulate matter (PM). One issue that is raised by this new focus is the spatial misalignment error introduced by the lack of spatial homogeneity in many of the PM components. Current approaches to estimating short-term health risks via time series modeling do not take into account the spatial properties of the chemical components and therefore could result in biased estimation of those risks. We present a spatial-temporal statistical model for quantifying spatial misalignment error and show how adjusted health risk estimates can be obtained using a regression calibration approach and a 2-stage Bayesian model. We apply our methods to a database containing information on hospital admissions, air pollution, and weather for 20 large urban counties in the United States.","inCitations":["bea277fecde0fe9ba4a8a4572a4ad2cbcb65f82c","75dc26a5a9f5717c47eb1265ecc40d07d720cc7f","43ad76a20e9df573f53b2d9ded7cfd9cd12be34b","094e0288f663ab0a2d31bfa33e7aa69fd7e44cbf","3c62c7ea75e15f7460ac99f1e68b930244619236","628f86f2c6739bad11916e74d60289ee516ed61e","823b0a5d183a0ebcfab1983ceb353fd22e86516a","cd87d189e7d597a7392700eb616934a8144fadc2","fa3ae1a12c8d398d200195d58143aa4006bbd7ef","879698130325a38cf89be8753eeff3e55cd8d1b8","f37ca66fdb29798f78b285b40cf00719190492da","e420e146a693955775c1ef7d889d189c03f3f64c","907fe980c5febae4289ef433e9095cd478975290","d6ac94ee0be0d78787dcc89d603ea0b433be7a92","4df3bd6c6aaf6f6674a7c082929bcc0fecb278b1","e516601ae61b3060b5910f8cda92942b59f58e61","250fffb5eff2b9ddb527f1705287dcf0658daa77","bd654302d2e5af3a4721e514b1c291166138f0da","c255caedeb4d2a635beee3ace12c357ddb326dbb","52ee88c11a54f8eed13e3eca4b5ed5cf8177344c","bf5f08ba0ce4e159d12f126ce81c8c8c797339a3","ed624510362304203be5cb155de326769d8d9912","7392042a5351a89f6a4bd73894e928d390653b06","cf925f63670a8531ec2de879c2328f1f14206e10","7cc29409aee0cb705e22ee2eb7c9e04fe8fd54c6","c99edce21b2b0369b1cfecb58fbbf2dd68c71964","32d68a5f486752d643aa827b7adbacc75426ea14","30cf4c44cfeda522a2d58e9fc5cd3c5492f5dc36","73cea7905fb31be52b104c04f4d626c95a125699","b073412f31e9afe93b6a6c84e1aa8a5fbbb3c1ce","c9f69bf2c2d9e0b632f14d8bd30a171b062b01ec","a94599ee4f8100a345f61c4a01b1da2e78dbe6ee","5b5ceb73ee2ed36bb8968abc6d004ad512814b94","078e7cdde9606949646db889dc969305eeb9a8f2","fd4274531baa6c17c62b4c6a48669084adbd7450","7f89ade32cf3fcd079184fa45c6d2a13906d2c27","c38b18a0282cf3ed8b3ef67452c7a9537a99dc03","3830e34baeddae451c005b4a9e2a1d92d3a9d8f8","ce191f7d42f5a9a48a88659b59468b2a1055cb76","8b8b6d06e61a1da54dc8e370434911304be47e29","7a96acb9af4754442242cb432a7ee326151c36d8","2bc6aebef8c311cf5f453250702796783797ae4f","9b2b284241ffd336d4fc361745efcaaeac312b9d","d716dca5add503ad0c241c38f1b06601299a9867","6ab99e918ea8190d8afafc0b6272af5c8efa92a1","8855177783598a869a75f087657193148c52592d","0768a5238bf512fb6751339c2408587d98862a84","7f12ced686d024bde9d6f5148797639599f9744f","957f676d4c1aeb1c1f97949f4d6ab2fd5f93335d","0c2f49a240b096a324831ce64f411366623fb6fa","8a1b7d7926c260322916aa2118ed9e5ff4139b94","a35e6fccf93b199eca4dd1af65f1b41c7df049d6","5b9f6a67d941e93bdc79dc5f455e473daffc4abd","fbe72f5a7a4707c19ccf10018bca6c9e85964a86","c3991c2904d39d5f90247359d9bf16a00ef29096","38b03bb129fbf1cac52df7045eb5ca777e9049e0","3b4eeac3fbab6b00e52191b7a9419162d1470562","9d51c6989f89b52d284abba3072470b831e563ac","f01d7e9e3cafdf1aa2bcec2bd82acc2e474077e1","4a43163892d4d3321a866fb0853ded424323e2bb","ea2be75ac2fada8223c54d793cd54d1a65695a6c","2f47ecd022535d1a0a4bdb4701207efaa1c7e5a7"],"title":"Spatial misalignment in time series studies of air pollution and health data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq017"}

Given the complexity of procedures, long acquisition times, and high cost, ligand displacement imaging trials often have a limited size and produce sparse RO results over the time course of the blocking drug. To take the best advantage of the available data, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze RO as a function of the displacing drug. The model has three components: the first estimates RO using brain regional time-radioactivity concentrations, the second shapes the pharmacokinetic profile of the blocking drug, and the last relates PK to RO. Compared to standard 2-steps RO estimation methods, our Bayesian approach quantifies the variability of the individual RO measures. The model has also useful prediction capabilities: to quantify brain RO for dosage regimens of the drug that were not tested in the experiment. This permits the optimal dose selection of neuroscience drugs at a limited cost. We illustrate the method in the prediction of RO after multiple dosing from a single-dose trial.","inCitations":["55c24417d0881012f7e841726e2de20651d43bcf","e7476f947bcb88f54cb382215365fb449081100d"],"title":"Bayesian hierarchical modeling of receptor occupancy in PET trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701697158"}

We analyze an adaptive procedure based on cross validation, and establish its convergence rate under the Frobenius norm. The convergence rates under other matrix norms are also established. This method also enjoys the advantage of fast computation for large-scale problems, via a coordinate descent algorithm. Numerical merits are illustrated using both simulated and real datasets. In particular, it performs favorably on an HIV brain tissue dataset and an ADHD resting-state fMRI dataset.","inCitations":["7f456f969568625f75288917adf25510cf2f3321","4b358245e89fb7678340641f1b5760f9940e32f7","6f24e94b855a293c8435b90c4df7e3f98d1bbd23","abb1b20d096ed9dd56ad990e31d5c0d049c29494","488355b9218649a36ea0fc8303696e383a3eb791","6c63d28cf34f51a5dcd4216a43c1b51fa8c5e3b2","f31e1255a27e177386d1dd8e299198a5de2fcaba","612232fcd4d88d6bb4bfd741d291e348b2b198de","6b485583373bd2c0d64ee03c221f145f61dec2b8","2c321425190beb4a3bf5eef7b8f3a9455b84094a","55e0552c0ebab959ad0ac96543fa97ec7801b27f","037c21796d07393653e42cfd24e9899f592d1546","50894f217236e342a8b1abea0c69c02fd58083b4","3d70169d10abf5b89eabbea9207313ea8dc497a2","313259cfcbbfa14671a4a2211dd990ec90c6f714","d1528bfa6bc35d1afc5c8a741c55df3b2a87b710","64aab1d03d6226e9cbdebde9f1791df7fe3ba90b","0c06505aa991c5db9bea3c315bdd42999a41124a","83c8f55b622d82d2ed0bfd82bfd3262ee56aef4e","b5325b3db14b0f39efb8009864d78b8c51856004","20a8f0417c346b7e04aaf2d6fd239f8c10c97805","5cdc637bed0728ef6fd06b941968a9a42e1d1ec8","c7d0d2fbb1deb103cd38742da981bc14e979d474","74b3866843a1aea19257218d602c4848c452bc3a"],"title":"Fast and adaptive sparse precision matrix estimation in high dimensions","doi":"10.1016/J.Jmva.2014.11.005"}

The influence of cluster-constant confounders can be eliminated by studying the exposure-outcome association within (conditional on) clusters, but additional regression modeling is usually required to control for observed cluster-varying confounders. A problem is that the working regression model may be misspecified, in which case the estimated within-cluster association may be biased. To reduce sensitivity to model misspecification we propose to augment the standard working model for the outcome with an auxiliary working model for the exposure. We derive a doubly robust conditional generalized estimating equation (DRCGEE) estimator for the within-cluster association. This estimator combines the two models in such a way that it is consistent if either model is correct, not necessarily both. Thus, the DRCGEE estimator gives the researcher two chances instead of only one to make valid inference on the within-cluster association. We have implemented the estimator in an R package and we use it to examine the association between smoking during pregnancy and cognitive abilities in offspring, in a sample of siblings.","inCitations":["baa94e38c7952f7d567e6ba0e80d9677e42d5580","6732d5210dafddbcb77b1a102285303f5081a231","b38648167de3a4f3d5c3a365cc58efbadf6ca5bb","037eeb24aebbce7cc81434f2824c290f42a808cf","fe92ad49e1b70b4be91d794614be721e9c6a9ea8","cc6a021e5c9797ead05311e066026265482eeff0","17876cfea4f08fc3995bbb6f4b4da8969dc0ccbc","aaae488df75b74de597d0385be8719e3c39d08e6","1628d373254e2d5f8a2db0a420c3d9aa0823e1e1"],"title":"Doubly robust methods for handling confounding by cluster.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv041"}

An incoherent decision is either (a) a recommendation to escalate the dose following an observed dose-limiting toxicity or (b) a recommendation to deescalate the dose following a non-dose-limiting toxicity. In a simulated example, we illustrate that the Bayesian optimal interval method and the Keyboard method are not coherent. We generated dose-limiting toxicity outcomes under an assumed set of true probabilities for a trial of n=36 patients in cohorts of size 1, and we counted the number of incoherent dosing decisions that were made throughout this simulated trial. Each of the methods studied resulted in 13/36 (36%) incoherent decisions in the simulated trial. Additionally, for two different target dose-limiting toxicity rates, 20% and 30%, and a sample size of n=30 patients, we randomly generated 100 dose-toxicity curves and tabulated the number of incoherent decisions made by each method in 1000 simulated trials under each curve. For each method studied, the probability of incurring at least one incoherent decision during the conduct of a single trial is greater than 75%. Coherency is an important principle in the conduct of dose-finding trials. Interval-based methods violate this principle for cohorts of size 1 and require additional modifications to overcome this shortcoming. Researchers need to take a closer look at the dose assignment behavior of interval-based methods when using them to plan dose-finding studies.","inCitations":["1fbdbea3205b532a6d9139839743b00631d5d1a5"],"title":"Coherence principles in interval-based dose finding.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1974"}

In many applications, researchers are interested in using these measurements as covariates to predict a scalar response in a regression setting, with interest focusing on the most biologically relevant time window of exposure. One example is in panel studies of the health effects of particulate matter (PM), where particle levels are measured over time. In such studies, there are many more values of the functional data than observations in the data set so that regularization of the corresponding functional regression coefficient is necessary for estimation. Additional issues in this setting are the possibility of exposure measurement error and the need to incorporate additional potential confounders, such as meteorological or co-pollutant measures, that themselves may have effects that vary over time. To accommodate all these features, we develop wavelet-based linear mixed distributed lag models that incorporate repeated measures of functional data as covariates into a linear mixed model. A Bayesian approach to model fitting uses wavelet shrinkage to regularize functional coefficients. We show that, as long as the exposure error induces fine-scale variability in the functional exposure profile and the distributed lag function representing the exposure effect varies smoothly in time, the model corrects for the exposure measurement error without further adjustment. Both these conditions are likely to hold in the environmental applications we consider. We examine properties of the method using simulations and apply the method to data from a study examining the association between PM, measured as hourly averages for 1-7 days, and markers of acute systemic inflammation. We use the method to fully control for the effects of confounding by other time-varying predictors, such as temperature and co-pollutants.","inCitations":["569ae7e7f4733ad3f5f93c26da443ab766138975","6666473c926665eecc741a0dd29e1b329d273e38","f0bf381873906b589a23093d0060548885ed2707","3aa375ce609e728cb327936b93284509fc07d126","bd3b2037cad070fad3f487e422660038c660bd73","9d2aa689305a0fb4230af70c7e05fdcb030aa182","9d505829ff214cba0409b7d296deffb45b4361a4","1f211db351ad7528d9aafc93767f30e8cc185571","be7dc661ea3c40b6e27df3106812b6f9f89b706e","d023ed362de49e2b6e8419ea784de7ea1f16ac1e","cf7c025b5ca3c0e936828d783667d4f862364b0e","e5d06791cf9857f44eece2bd58ae1cfffcb5b3d0","3819b56cf7d808d31071f28fdbe81a3cc2d130f6","f360d35ed6c538168a7fa5fc70b327fa9b571817","b4401500110b43b28c955e7829ecab93d6381a7c","bb5f2d60731ab730031eb3c2d5c2be907a66a618"],"title":"Wavelet-based functional linear mixed models: an application to measurement error-corrected distributed lag models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq003"}
