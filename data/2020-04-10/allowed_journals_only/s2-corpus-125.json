Besides its apparent relevance for a set of specific scientific hypotheses, an accurate estimate of this parameter is key for many multiple testing procedures. Most existing methods for estimating π0 in the literature are motivated from the independence assumption of test statistics, which is often not true in reality. Simulations indicate that most existing estimators in the presence of the dependence among test statistics can be poor, mainly due to the increase of variation in these estimators. In this paper, we propose several data-driven methods for estimating π0 by incorporating the distribution pattern of the observed p-values as a practical approach to address potential dependence among test statistics. Specifically, we use a linear fit to give a data-driven estimate for the proportion of true-null p-values in (λ, 1] over the whole range [0, 1] instead of using the expected proportion at 1 - λ. We find that the proposed estimators may substantially decrease the variance of the estimated true null proportion and thus improve the overall performance.","inCitations":["8a2a09ef11ef10e20e2cbe0610390e6cdf6a9a1c","1574bb42d21ee99dcd9ac7d6796b9cca40d22b01","f1305bd9919230f3a2d603ea4b292728cf8cddd2","a9c720c7365a206f5781ea74b07c664a25f47743","b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c"],"title":"Estimating the Proportion of True Null Hypotheses Using the Pattern of Observed p-values.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2013.800035"}

This paper focuses on outcomes trials in particular, thus we are concerned with binary response variables. The proposed method determines the likelihood of observing a statistically significant treatment effect at the end of a study, conditional on the data observed at an interim time point and assuming that event rates governing future observations follow beta distributions. In particular, the prior distributions for the event rates of interest are updated based on the observed data at an interim time point, such that means and variances are intuitive functions of the data. Computational aspects will be discussed for the case in which event counts are functions of sample size and event rates only, and for situations in which they are functions of sample size, event rates, and exposure duration. We will discuss appropriate thresholds for declaring futility based on this approach, and the potential impact of overdispersion, a common phenomenon particularly in global outcomes trials.","inCitations":["8a30c1324a69ce8891c173fdef949ed509bf1814"],"title":"Predictive probability of success and the assessment of futility in large outcomes trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400601001485"}

This paper deals with a new perspective of understanding the sample distribution of the test statistics for comparing the APCs between overlapping regions.

The primary aim of measurement is to identify relevant pieces of observable information that thoroughly describe the construct of interest. Validation of the construct is often performed separately. Noting the increasing popularity of latent variable methods in biomedical research, we propose a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC) latent variable model that combines item reduction and validation. Our joint latent variable model accounts for the bias that occurs in the traditional 2-stage process. The methods are motivated by an example from the Physical Activity and Lymphedema clinical trial in which the objectives were to describe lymphedema severity through self-reported Likert scale symptoms and to determine the relationship between symptom severity and a \"gold standard\" diagnostic measure of lymphedema. The MIMIC model identified 1 symptom as a potential candidate for removal. We present this paper as an illustration of the advantages of joint latent variable models and as an example of the applicability of these models for biomedical research.","inCitations":["2ac5a6140d71d091de455c42895bd1274299fb78","b4baabf380a0443ed1799ad475fbe2e287f58e68","b6234c3f3ca49f49bc57bc631418e264f3c418de","5b2cc3e0a9c38c22291639527fdb9799065192df"],"title":"A joint latent variable model approach to item reduction and validation.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr018"}

The use of such a response endpoint entails a potentially severe loss of information. A more efficient strategy could be obtained by using longitudinal measures of the change in visual acuity. In this paper we investigate, by using data from two randomized clinical trials, the mean and variance-covariance structures of the longitudinal measurements of the change in visual acuity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIndividual patient data were collected in 234 patients in a randomized trial comparing interferon-α with placebo and in 1181 patients in a randomized trial comparing three active doses of pegaptanib with sham. A linear model for longitudinal data was used to analyze the repeated measurements of the change in visual acuity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor both trials, the data were adequately summarized by a model that assumed a quadratic trend for the mean change in visual acuity over time, a power variance function, and an antedependence correlation structure. The power variance function was remarkably similar for the two datasets and involved the square root of the measurement time.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe similarity of the estimated variance functions and correlation structures for both datasets indicates that these aspects may be a genuine feature of the measurements of changes in visual acuity in patients with ARMD. The feature can be used in the planning and analysis of trials that use visual acuity as the clinical endpoint of interest.","inCitations":["74a6dd7008f788c37895ee18e84f368061b114af"],"title":"The correlation structure of longitudinal measurements of vision in patients with macular degeneration.","doi":"10.1002/pst.419"}

Microarray experiments typically give us expression measurements on 1000-20 000 genes, but with few replicates for each gene. Traditional methods using means and standard deviations to detect differential expression are not satisfactory in this context. A handful of alternative statistics have been developed, including several empirical Bayes methods. In the present paper we present two full hierarchical Bayes models for detecting gene expression, of which one (D) describes our microarray data very well. We also compare the full Bayes and empirical Bayes approaches with respect to model assumptions, false discovery rates and computer running time. The proposed models are compared to existing empirical Bayes models in a simulation study and for a set of data (Yuen et al., 2002), where 27 genes have been categorized by quantitative real-time PCR. It turns out that the existing empirical Bayes methods have at least as good performance as the full Bayes ones.","inCitations":["fddcd6ee3034ec644a294c54d77f7b2cd20e2e3a","974adb4d033400c0b8596a1c439530b489458b7e","9f23366aefc487bd1eb508939b42bd6065f092bc","2346c3838e58e2d39f9501d4cd152d9739a0a7ec","b93d84a97f09664ec72d65682ef460cbac59fa09","40b356d0279a1ddd6aeb7a2b595bada19b95de2b","d3faf15fcd760164ff2f06fb79718554ae29f362","7de06c99bd635b2bc7dee1261cf8faf9135f406f","f481c47328e06ea4b10fc5ce0589cfe70428ec71","cd25f14b6711fe19c71d368c805441f21141dd82","69470248e40b342b5fdfd1c31dd9fa5e698804cb","1c5665edac542d90d489ef80ffa851d9c0ed4c27","9cfa8fdbe8c25578afae68b291aab69ed991bdf2","e3ff2505f7453eb4840d27d041af08d215f59777","088c45b34a93756b0274d2fe9486bb3305eb63ca","8f7504ddb9778aeae58d264fe40b6f52c39be29d","6c081da51493b89daab655c47c522e7651edbd32","dc10302af774e55eea7ee27b5542be2246cb775d","fbc71a1d5c602190c0b14a075ec9d6b8f269401b","25c16a40138b7828d438cde53534896c6e683075","db6f71d83bb6dc38ed37e622b6c61dd731fdb9f3","9ccaac8953c6c219f0c169672c22bab7af84bbc2","f82b2050f4d624847093c5921ff3cb4e48c8a0f8","d91830e85f218ad91b1b9379ae42abd752ca9170","5d73c82a65e085d3edf0a24a6208c873bb82b998","5ff041cb8369d55821854676bbdee7b40c618a78","f865ddf85bcf032512b91f7b6eb210125400d202","07dae86af71c58b5eb60ccb5f0c4e98ed12b0d1b","52cd1d0277e7e23945b70a810f5839633fd2a1a7","15fae4fd354063c8b5dd2d035cc2891c621c72c8","dd521fb8a716001928645e1a5d351bd38e9fa055"],"title":"Hierarchical Bayes models for cDNA microarray gene expression.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi009"}

Under the assumption of additive measurement errors this reduces to a problem of deconvolution of densities. Deconvolution methods often make restrictive and unrealistic assumptions about the density of interest and the distribution of measurement errors, e.g., normality and homoscedasticity and thus independence from the variable of interest. This article relaxes these assumptions and introduces novel Bayesian semiparametric methodology based on Dirichlet process mixture models for robust deconvolution of densities in the presence of conditionally heteroscedastic measurement errors. In particular, the models can adapt to asymmetry, heavy tails and multimodality. In simulation experiments, we show that our methods vastly outperform a recent Bayesian approach based on estimating the densities via mixtures of splines. We apply our methods to data from nutritional epidemiology. Even in the special case when the measurement errors are homoscedastic, our methodology is novel and dominates other methods that have been proposed previously. Additional simulation results, instructions on getting access to the data set and R programs implementing our methods are included as part of online supplemental materials.","inCitations":["0353fb2066f908ab8a1eb23beacf80a3fe827b7a","4469a5251ca5817131584e31a785afe89f202cd1","aecc3b421bf4aff3f1743a2f6cfc865203909474","abae0aa551d98782daaca5c9cc5ee1f8f056d7b4","3dda24e8ac0324e1b50be35b3c28b42766819fb0","4e1675ba05e0d2c7df5d418bc4e99dacc938ca7e","374e4212a2ed3596f7157697d2f94a09ed8e81b1","4a27761b47c79dc1cece1bf24f0de2ce93cb3262","b6708c63634512f2ea8207f8a835c526ecf15706","9bc4149befa8a3c2041b515e9ebb87a0afdb8c7a","6c416103fca46c051ac0b93dad6181acf1309e1d"],"title":"Bayesian Semiparametric Density Deconvolution in the Presence of Conditionally Heteroscedastic Measurement Errors.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2014.899237"}

This is particularly the case in genomics applications. One type of statistical problem in such applications is concerned with modeling an output variable as a function of a small subset of a large number of features based on relatively small sample sizes, which may even be coming from multiple subpopulations. As such, selecting the correct predictive features (variables) for each subpopulation is the key. To address this issue, we consider the problem of feature selection in finite mixture of sparse normal linear (FMSL) models in large feature spaces. We propose a 2-stage procedure to overcome computational difficulties and large false discovery rates caused by the large model space. First, to deal with the curse of dimensionality, a likelihood-based boosting is designed to effectively reduce the number of candidate features. This is the key thrust of our new method. The greatly reduced set of features is then subjected to a sparsity inducing procedure via a penalized likelihood method. A novel scheme is also proposed for the difficult problem of finding good starting points for the expectation-maximization estimation of mixture parameters. We use an extended Bayesian information criterion to determine the final FMSL model. Simulation results indicate that the procedure is successful in selecting the significant features without including a large number of insignificant ones. A real data example on gene transcription regulation is also presented.","inCitations":["cdf4fa4c9fcca9abfc95f338e81c05f94366ca8d","e2d3b24512d9492a10ed0afc0f250c6d49af3872","7df3b0c7cc025e97ff83aef9ee2b526e32770a20","86ced36172d2ba3d17ed85212cfcf96fa96eae2c","8d1d41ad8f4e0c9450076b3ca812e9f7511075a9","5f9d46c7edb4158fe954555c0d5b7bf2e01e7165","0afb55f38a3005cff71a8fe785cf74cbc725226c","e1d890be3e704bf30ecb693a7ca6d3d29c41c648","410244d776840e5d6631190b54a49b007c397ffa","36fdf4204d5a78748384e5e10647085477a87d59","e034e4532983203bb4b951a4aaedc106ee09527b","86d00bac96857067aa60ad37e00aa172f9312659","e8046eb51450fbc1b360d6d8a29f2d056ebdf455"],"title":"Feature selection in finite mixture of sparse normal linear models in high-dimensional feature space.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq048"}

It was noticed from empirical studies that this measure has several key weaknesses, such as an inability to reflect nonuniform weighting of different decision thresholds, resulting in large numbers of ties. We propose the weighted area under the ROC curve (WAUC) in this paper to address the problems associated with PAUC. Our proposed measure enjoys a greater flexibility to describe the discrimination accuracy of genes. Nonparametric and parametric estimation methods are introduced, including PAUC as a special case, along with theoretical properties of the estimators. We also provide a simple variance formula, yielding a novel variance estimator for nonparametric estimation of PAUC, which has proven challenging in previous work. The proposed methods permit sensitivity analyses, whereby the impact of differing weight functions on gene rankings may be assessed and results may be synthesized across weights. Simulations and re-analysis of two well-known microarray datasets illustrate the practical utility of WAUC.","inCitations":["4ad83fdd213311289ce6d10dfcb5753067156741","7177d831461f5a433e85ac3bb5d12732e2e3f4c8","869878571dfc2c24331aaf5df9335f74c3f1370a","e332cac952ebb3258d7bd8b4285922eb9c00d7c5","27546dce4ee9a41dbac31a8c6a0b1f9b90f97a77","ef726ba1489b67f267b734950a16ff7e299f8f84","030339aab46601d340192f42d8355e11b0286778","6eeca2ac051694437f146fa700bd41a970496aa7","ed67016ed24b156d16ae7ce30bb83bb186a8580b","74e177c8cab13e7735b9900e43a29d0f99637c54","9eab55dfa98d49562b8b392f2b662e7007c5810c","34d867fafddcaaa88fd383364f0f115d42377034","2751fdbfd6df3fcc61aa9a178f100e84398e1cee","30f7ac82a664b1c8f181ca5e191ceb70f43a4d67"],"title":"Weighted Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Its Application to Gene Selection.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00713.x"}

We propose a methodology for period estimation based on spectrum resampling (SR) techniques. Simulation studies show that SR is superior and more robust to non-sinusoidal and noisy cycles than a currently used routine based on Fourier approximations. In addition, a simple fit to the oscillations using linear least squares is available, together with a non-parametric test for detecting changes in period length which allows for period estimates with different variances, as frequently encountered in practice. The proposed methods are motivated by and applied to various data examples from chronobiology.","inCitations":["161ccde8e7829ed70fac93e39727fad4d856f3dc","6deb8bb411260ad994c624e5c249fe9998e8c96b","cc2f99d9d1f73b694360299acfb5745eb6b65584","fb58c3ffaa5f2a6ff82fe7f5b844cc8c0a982357","97e70d0775a13802f48d02f4aa62c582e8f2362a","50c90a92558ab4e31eaaed3f3982f4625d54f8e0","66a0750b361ae212339e455e088c8b7f8aeb8b42","48d9213610e840381ce57fb13281f93174a9d6ad","ae0bf47d0754b9b8c0acd141659e36e50f52bc02","fe3d42c8f13018391c583d789670015a8bbf95df","f5fed651901f34faf287e3b550992bf97186a34b","461529ac82089c66552b1df7fcec06e673859fd0","d8e829c29bc16c959dae65993da1341772ccb2da","5cd899ed1ed6a06582699e4f3cfa7967c10b29de","af8cf141b956eedc44a92eac4163fc8e33ee3bbb","0cfc2f6f84599d749aa3e481dba1834606271ff7","5e30ae3350a01387f5f1c07144c0f440f78485bc","cd1ba53b524c900b5af18fd2f23e70529f1117cc","5be9428ad38a8e05929627b325ee210f9ad752cd","f5120aa787737a1928940ab4bca607dc800716e4","052a5d8bd253232f49c2af45959b4cecc062b945","f85b1e329f4c06ab8c7ecc8f90e274047de1a42f","93286e4937540cf7df2dc5c980af9a0c787d6797","7a7ccec69b452d2b5e9100d94fbec495fb880cba","34883572db14515224a249f57457256596dd6512","b4c82782377e0213f4639ecc0a04eb9d7a1b875b","23809c552ce8fe4b00d6315536637ab0a6c54e4c","86e79dee35068a2e5375c9d5155488b9a34ecf7d","087809a1e0bb1ab7f47e6d2ae0ff1e7cd95888e5"],"title":"Inference on periodicity of circadian time series.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt020"}

In this note, we propose a simple test procedure along this line, and show its advantages over the standard combination tests for linkage or association in the literature through a data set from Genetic Analysis Workshop 12 (GAW12) and an extensive simulation study.","inCitations":["1e6f9ae509411457a8ab983117f1efa92979368f","0cf7a9460ee931fdd5eb8bc6c98ff7a21de8e3c7","17e21576b15e7bc29c525cf3df7da7f69d62789f","1ea21f54f2471e5866cb405efdbea4da466444f2","0cdba29e707c14a7808f115bc18f1a594c383163","cc874a2892cf4bb1ea8fef671afc0d2fd00a5883","9b79fe18cc6cbfe60c5bc411308febaee468fc1a","b0ba4433aa57c9e95bc74428692586329bb75164","00a9c0abf86af54129f2962abfbc9b9892d4dfbe","b7fe9d2975b933dceae87d970bd37cb233f144cc","dcfb236d2c74564342d0be030cfcb58f597b228c","ad1ddeea76b19254e87d6a90f1f6845619b22d12","da0e5e743e3dc0a843bbfa93342b3f3b862ff993","1d9ee09e351ed48d65055805edaeffa4dfdda103","3a670a3793585f232f07141b503a79f82423533a","02e2d32266f823210b873e5c770aaf66ece44596","349faa5000616a7f9c7ad9cd28f3d925810857c5","07e1cdcd9ba94c91532ecaec41f442b55e04a780","1659eee57e80870301adf5bdba901ca398337b75","1fed738265315daa46ada5d0311fa9929aa7ae5c","0e0749ecb9dfa76d4321a659c7d8162292d75acd","b5c595199cb1bacb4653db893b7a0cc915f303ad","58b6cb50310bd4c536535316acc885597fb090b8","9515db556428bea985450c2efa6aa6f06d0af6d8","6e5ddba8bbd0a142dde0fb5fedb0436780c6329e","88fb2037138b64fdae97f96784ba3e12890484df","3f960bfc71b7c4ffb6b23d09e62805ebd0dd76d4","7efbacf53b0219a96b7a2e9e1e14975d749cf031","f2723b87bf17140f8da8c14132ac3e49472e664e","74d922464314618658f3206159b7321f64effcd1","ab88a396bdcc801e2f0642ff18d731477d83adaa","b562f5c1c967d5582e72ccbbb7b1698e97f051f9","09d77af22826f5027e595ad4a31f0c93baff1273","7397827eb25d738bd83dd493e8614ea7bac820ef","2f6f2d50fff6394424ce92c169adca6d7e8f6494","8f3623c0a0c86154dc355751207e7bfbc6ccf2af"],"title":"Combining dependent tests for linkage or association across multiple phenotypic traits.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.223"}

Count data are routinely modeled using Poisson and Negative Binomial (NB) regression but zero-inflated and hurdle models may be advantageous in this setting. Here we compared the fit of the Poisson, Negative Binomial (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), Poisson Hurdle (PH), and Negative Binomial Hurdle (NBH) models. In general, for public health studies, we may conceptualize zero-inflated models as allowing zeroes to arise from at-risk and not-at-risk populations. In contrast, hurdle models may be conceptualized as having zeroes only from an at-risk population. Our results illustrate, for our data, that the ZINB and NBH models are preferred but these models are indistinguishable with respect to fit. Choosing between the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling framework, assuming Poisson and NB models are inadequate because of excess zeroes, should generally be based on the study design and purpose. If the study's purpose is inference then modeling framework should be considered. For example, if the study design leads to count endpoints with both structural and sample zeroes then generally the zero-inflated modeling framework is more appropriate, while in contrast, if the endpoint of interest, by design, only exhibits sample zeroes (e.g., at-risk participants) then the hurdle model framework is generally preferred. Conversely, if the study's primary purpose it is to develop a prediction model then both the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling frameworks should be adequate.","inCitations":["a6b08b2cc3f7579f5089e0c0d9038a3a40fdaaec","352fc5095e54e8e1a6214dd225a3cdd074407bbf","d0fe54ef78ee3b8bf7717d1445b89c3a022b1a93","567efd7b5eb6788211011aa86b9bbf91cb885dfe","8d5d97ee727560276f14e637ff129aaa14b6727a","d06ede6d0e45be1d959948d5294fd557cb704260","d22738fa48d9837c5792e5c305da1683838f6665","761398b2bec82c928def808561c3bdc68f8bcd54","24e782651f7413540dec54d91efc40bddaf4abb9","549e89e7ebfb5571ca49994f5ea8812632dd2a82","6983a4b9792ad690bea53aba39b2cda4a35cc3f8","db2819b3cdaf094f0b28768a3bf6b8faaa9ebe4b","b4fa12202792fbe08dee5567cd586a50923bb728","a5a2fe84cbac68891085d448f3808c7bf0c9801b","ed7d31eacd2661a128e5100d8646b7dc6607ccae","8e5cc430b2e8b174f0df82a2bb0e78f7eb079d94","1e21b38bf2678637de40ce778794676caaac3218","256dcbc00034440bc7f444d1d2588673f3bbac5e","b8e1cb9df1b33ab4ef6f6d416c2bd62233fd5ed5","9f0a57646f6a47fc81f457933d01695b455e6005","d757d286aade771ad02e451b91e3a595f7cef7b9","eb63a8bca1b451e12c4e16a549d0e25fe4a27c26","5bdc1fe0e281fb294731dc18d007848b432bc5f0","fbbee8268b61d747f8cee00fa5be9a8138db9b58","64aad3e362a36e616af74298f6711952398b314b","c03f9b45bbc34d980499c316cec773d837d5fe57","9a82f4c094e3f857da77b629b3e58b4032e6366f","9710d327ccf1d670154917e838a26b403c0337f6","0ad749f701aa7a303f210e27def2fea26524e1f4","7e70986eb3c20f9593a6a8e575284d3e336d72cf","588c35ebdee0625152ff63184d6f6481341c6168","104e4038bdc8ad6222592d20d5f410fbd7119b36","7cd80c1a5179e9c4026a7916413a4a48b89178d8","ace3ba1505607881e8a38676e687db659d05eccc","5c986ee68e8c8e4379e563b8abf323e45abfb836","db6f9cc36fe26e289ffb49ae444da08d807f9e4a","9afd0f2fdf2e7ed57087e0d1fc068bfee1ef2d12","8dcf22ee2c596094e942feff6b50c128909df626","0ff2898732be62ee466f36a51d82daae4e6a1352","3dab0a357bfc8c9a7db4b997406ca14a808f7bd9","bbef7ce63ae26842c7c1dbf5f756b7e5df4a5afa","51fce32054949c14aa318def3b046f5ac36f20dc","8d89b5c8cbea08565826ee01c3ddb7ed5efaf822","276f4efef99896bb2da707410c8f2f5e0f5dc1f4","8193bea96cf542306df7938b8d0eb6d04a3f9726","8a70f22edbf74608e625d2cc70dd097cd63972f9","b07471fbfd0f39cb331b661d9483caf85c251cac","b25f02a7d85745e41f9b66f5de514844f3dd2958","be47b2760384b47a8f7e200cee9ecae84f4bf35f","31878dff06a1e15b74b0bab4730858e96ff29c22","38f3d8c0076db41452b71ad3ca07314f5e05d2a6","fef1b4c46da7d2cc25b9b5783e28b1c6dc835b23","ab470032fecd80c1d58ac429a7ca920eb834cf01","aa43ddfb932593ab76c51d6306649c5b6126b35d","16e9450e29a173d01c30a556564f1b0aa09a5fbe","053f9a8cc554c96d1b13e8bf4ab4e2def749694b","01b464e32eb0b6abc8935d1573531b6624b200d9","33eee00424e2d6729f584e29389969c39643f16d","6bb3880628a63acb487f5d2af57bcbe0d4eb4b24","bff251f91ed44e834a38edf8cf9ae1d2fe3323cf","3f0ae923d91066b823d61b0310a5f8240205aa5a","da929524b2d361bb7127a655d977d37a22c18b20","b12b944fdf1f343809ac8fdab731e76a41961a7f","5c9446ee6f4370ca5baca7e0ae496417ace28864","b716882fbd621d31b58e2292132bae1fa212d590","c7fae4b6a576d9a61054aeb8cc57f3a254ff70ba","85c805de36f1e7c40f6783b23effe3ddc4d697e7","12aa5bccc79277179a96950cd718b0943baaabb6","9ce5a5a20551815e9d6e54602cac26096d5821ec","2c3e8c058646233e6273de845a8c1461138177b6","a8b385d4d95d5922341788c8028cab29fa711d7e","2772240302d08d76ff558b6f61f81725036066a2","1ad67a99444a491a2894a31d9bbe62ea054499c1","89c03f4853eb106929c5838d24dd190e23d2aab7","60f2489b06d6432588c1afebe6a38138b09a7310","2ecfbe24a13ef484db0635da29101fb733a9f82c","c47c778b259526a6c77a7afadbfa39875f67a466","edc02fa60cb3e7777a1895163cd2d3639a6047cd"],"title":"On the use of zero-inflated and hurdle models for modeling vaccine adverse event count data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600719384"}

Sometimes, these genes may not be relevant to the biological process under study or their functions may already be known. The problem is that these genes can potentially drown out the effects of other genes that are relevant or have novel functions. We propose a procedure called complementary hierarchical clustering that is designed to uncover the structures arising from these novel genes that are not as highly expressed. Simulation studies show that the procedure is effective when applied to a variety of examples. We also define a concept called relative gene importance that can be used to identify the influential genes in a given clustering. Finally, we analyze a microarray data set from 295 breast cancer patients, using clustering with the correlation-based distance measure. The complementary clustering reveals a grouping of the patients which is uncorrelated with a number of known prognostic signatures and significantly differing distant metastasis-free probabilities.","inCitations":["cfd0c4849caf9be44637fb6d62179b3dcfff08f1","1098fb0241ce5cd3c07df145a506da5617018ee0","d7e763d8b9e65a1e702969c16528d7070521b198","da4da000c7b2ede6f4d9fab3ea8bd8df0705caae","e72e93ce05b54e8039b4196bc587fd5c8c10a86c","53eb46dcf5096b824e80cb2b8584434f65652f6d","784cbb81ee7123361a5689bf40c0646a7d462d82","9a19b83cb84b928a1c5d3cb2bc2797eda716fa81","2f9253a438b829ed606fbb62deb27a2c18bf2e26","5b1515ab6052288d9c76201b48cd8ce9022574dd","f6c195c8d7eb1db5a873f7620121d0b16059e2f9","3d123b2dbccb6027d4f54f7c671f40bcbf873d2e"],"title":"Complementary hierarchical clustering.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm046"}

Uncertainty about the extent of rounding is common when researchers analyze survey responses to numerical questions. The prevalent practice has been to take numerical responses at face value, even though many may in fact be rounded. This paper studies the rounding of responses to survey questions that ask persons to state the percent-chance that some future event will occur. We analyze data from the Health and Retirement Study and find strong evidence of rounding, the extent of rounding differing across respondents. We propose use of a person's response pattern across different questions to infer his rounding practice, the result being interpretation of reported numerical values as interval data. We then bring to bear recent developments on statistical analysis of interval data to characterize the potential consequences of rounding for empirical research. Finally, we propose enrichment of surveys by probing to learn the extent and reasons for rounding.","inCitations":["c4db3bf6d83fdca975256ebe936255c0198d3a5d","585567750573d18b6c02dc289d0529596b38bd70","8485404f7540b9c3560dab3ada6c73893d98b97e","0b4e51763b4556d6e0b96b201e1fe58ebe2d7060","42e3ee8137d4d9ecb07d43be2424fa741999f6b3","d73641c771f6f0a50ebec1b5ccf7b4dbd6b96894","846de8dafb61a26cad293f803c98343bb914d361","3840a430117c69b090443cdcb805dcdb47180e3d","c8079322ea8aa389f28cbaf60952bdebdf6dd7fe","de58a8d4c3ca49dd3fadb6b7a075d911e3f10344","0451a1dc05b2272430d1ede5671111e0a478d813","b7f805869521b930341b0222d7395a25fdd06b41","9d0b49e7eb7d4c305a405550d5b4bfb98a8a68d6","18cfec712c89d04b69602707684b260e2d571799","be68c166ab77800b6824a160e1e22c8c06a2eefb","6bcfc1939a35945c47bada249fb0c5aad923e81e","97f9b6258b74f1a730a7b92e1d9750761da123b9","61cb3f9864f79823fd1e2f1febfe1486961369a9","2bbb6c4d7686cd47d463ebf23c3d7847cf51cd98","93b11f12c0608d5260390f3207ff58fc085b7266","98dc616af60218d19ac4bf6bcc3746ec3bfc6634","7416d3585c4481c4bf44ae1612599db25f590f5e","49c7a856e9d87b4168eda3cc91dc99f198baf66c","ca995d1c35dca2f49c640f46e2c33d0c3524f419","27d4b76b30f8abf1dc3e6b98375f6abe7a85f0cc","f2205c64d5007ca4517c3340ff27ebef4b426a72","2549391c44ee6a19df870d969ff436803b9b9fc7","1c030e99e19c77dd9c1a34f15e92a795c0197e6a","9062579818608172eb28fa829b8a684d4e16e811","ff833987b58f3aa737cebbcf4aae819fa256d4f6","76f352e4decbab29feabc18d6bf6361af5a60ca4","11f95bc4573b799ac504a99dff98e7407f7f1034","bdcdfeb26bd20d9da7eee0d607dd109d65ad47c0","0b185e8dfc3319c954a5b5fd452586f42c44a39f","d0cea149a86be9b522d1303afc61911f6639cc78","c7b323ffa168855b4a7373bd91d966772f176c01","ec07da17a3c386c5bbef7623f4fa1a3426ca9f1d","a4667bdffde19b661ff0b60d4ea7f9093a5b999d","053a79df1726e37fc20b7e4eee706a5b2eda4f2f","32c539087a11771148284acd71a963a0397ffafa","c3e98f860f3480ec9df495be4ef72ad44aebac57","5a72aceafca78b2172bd1efd2c02437ee309a2d1","d90f4abbb33d18e3465598dba31d547a8cc8f1e0","10d06e0dcda10a40c509e732838e9c1ac0750b0f","1578bcfa1a16ba2283026b7ccc730dca2f237d8c","55c098f10e04234ff9a4afb485da4bcb30319320","c0914f1a64e9f590ff24f17bebe6503a587644f3","c50be9f8d2b658563ca2dd6076e87a1c55461f71","b0820d4f3570a6015d1cee57171a2426ec995453","e32aef44e0bcee8128fe95fba6771299178825a8","aca5e73fa83c0b5e94146cf4dbdde0097b2d40d7","980a7b22075b023fcb464c2cfc16e48a37f1d1af","3f743f66ee741e743781bb04e1479dd547e3c4b9","2c1114f9e3ef588fa10aab458fae36aff0da5f11","7b0703c1e3cafa307067e5b6df6dfb480b3652b0","d6f347c55a22e6add6ce6efb94baf018c167e25e","1331752f6e7425d10ac71bbd52873b0193552418","9bd50d104e97b8a4b4a22496d9fe60629d5942ff","8d836cf6aacfeabb1359c210d5b1ff1e57009034","912bd12a3fbdbf7cf8f838aa2c674dabfbe0fea8","7157129863f24772e9ed00926ef8ecc4034fb652","b83348c842bc1bb6840ae39f7066b030095cb93e","d8fcb71f7d93dcfc8172f56c998a2b1dbe58048e","df0f79885aee2a515c169dc99201819d68c5fee8","c9d3a9e2535b113a1f90ea6aa596d75529f3e177","f43add198d71e648ab5d9dc272e55d10985b81b2","3d974a3ab8bec689ba60a73e22b923c806ad751d","bb11a551d33d44ed328c517cc1bc10c33bd91747","965e7e48ab81be183297085e01bd316ddb83a5b3","e277193581a27558446c42a80dbe8fc19c601833","98218715b91cfd5eb9c391cbdc860960cb255055","f2f2d8f2cc5f9ea805c6a4a7eff4d8bb152f9cf1","9df9d87fe9fd045680ee8f13811868bc58783048","94bff493bd70935e8d2914fda91c711470f7fa73","94b02bb9fad8d95ffee07aca3d06106d31b3dc82","27badf88487992ff6bac2de2f86c7e915c99410e","6366c5e26479302e5e033c522fad67a614e3b8c8","c43a83f4c0c3c3fcf41656491173a85be84fdc39","378ee4336322f641fbcdae075a4a043bece67756","c49eb61b6da08becc043cdffb6e9629a76ab72e8","d50ae82f86122c30a4a6c99ac0db4d756e637ba2","885003247748e0bad8fe649d3baf144cedea1d53","327dd9c5c4a17baa6a430a74d8484adc0eb06ca6","5cee0c0eaafe36a10558bac6f2fbcd06bbb4c8eb","71b39ad4bffa9f028521d4934e43b890c6efd3b1","1a96b8fcdeefb1d1bfa7895f7aba8bc52fabba74","ed825d355a3cede625e33de226ab95a567d1be12","5678e031820164119c01c605ea6439737dea1919","0beededc23e08c7cc03544da4a0f9baee6c5f270","def74e6cfc59fa7e31c6d16bf4d4ce4c913ab81e","0ef5968f891f4f892d797415cdb23d1e39679d28","4cfac3a58c96c860c63a96273199973659788210","a1b187aafa3681bb8705f368257c795c1b18c62d","59ccdef12f537d9eba75f7c4414caac9fa574558","bd359b84287407d78f99e195ea0791ad11c0a8d6","f8a4c5ebde990ef2854cf4c831d35603e94711ee","f06455529d72b9b3db9b117cc1e424ec20303067","d807c6a3c64f5e9ec131fd6d20d899b6dd473b47","754d84c8356bf8ecbedf68fc358f4fc7292a545d","0ae81ff000a6be0c7a4b2a61d2f35ba95ed9ca00","c89aabde060df87388c2507e2f50614f623157c5","0d209168d000a294c4a1a27954738090967dd697","cff9928ad82cef16777846294702921663f4a148","37d62de76d2313e2a7d47905b410570309dc9f5a","b4bfd39cad24dd7a0429558dec947e6f969465d7","a022f18de20800fcc535f84cd40ca06b006e1351","73f9b75acb82e812105051cc19e89062ebd59eed","3cb1fb9152a8493efb920f934e23fba99052fb2c","68f1797f703a8ad70d9aa5cf5073b46d178c756b","2bd7e039c77b8103ba5c280cea9c701b52b0ea9f","b806f9d956c924c08cc7d765778c723b644fdbe9","bb7038506d12b2dde0ac0b277cbe51799546513e","f2a50cb4f9a9150e14793280d3825058f407832e","8efdba0edd52f4e48660b246f3ac65a55adda9a6"],"title":"Rounding

Scientists routinely summarize each array by a single index as the expression level of each probe-set (gene). We examine the adequacy of a uni-dimensional summary for characterizing the data matrix of each probe-set. To do so, we propose a low-rank matrix model for the probe-level intensities, and develop a useful framework for testing the adequacy of uni-dimensionality against targeted alternatives. This is an interesting statistical problem where inference has to be made based on one data matrix whose entries are not i.i.d. We analyze the asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistics, and use Monte Carlo simulations to assess their small sample performance. Applications of the proposed tests to GeneChip data show that evidence against a uni-dimensional model is often indicative of practically relevant features of a probe-set.","inCitations":["193387f9adf55a3eeb09be81e2c3e2e7660f7dfe","56f1f04a285d54e06bdbadd4727fab830e5ec6db","d8b7f82597653714dbd8f8a6a4f29970c07c83f1","11accfcfadce5c54723b6d18990336a4eee49810","4afad6f74e9c7c1abc41e960d73eb811c3598b8a"],"title":"Inference on Low-Rank Data Matrices with Applications to Microarray Data.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS262"}

Even though the link between the predictors and outcomes is not preserved in these studies, inference about individual-level exposure effects is often a goal. The disconnection between the level of inference and the level of analysis expands the array of potential biases that can invalidate the inference from group-level studies. While several sources of bias, specifically due to measurement error and confounding, may be more complex in group-level studies, two sources of bias, cross-level and model specification bias, are a direct consequence of the disconnection. With the goal of aligning inference from individual versus group-level studies, I discuss the interplay between exposure and study design. I specify the additional assumptions necessary for valid inference, specifically that the between- and within-group exposure effects are equal. Then cross-level inference is possible. However, all the information in the group-level analysis comes from between-group comparisons. Models where the group-level analysis provides even a small percentage of information about the within-group exposure effect are most susceptible to model specification bias.
