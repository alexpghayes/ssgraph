The classical maximum likelihood estimate is vulnerable to outliers and non-normal data. In this paper, a robust estimation method for the nonlinear structural equation model is proposed. This method gives more weight to data that are likely to occur based on the structure of the posited model, and effectively downweights the influence of outliers. An algorithm is proposed to obtain the robust estimator. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are investigated, which include the asymptotic distribution of the estimator, and some statistics for hypothesis testing. Results from a simulation study and a real data example show that our procedure is effective.","inCitations":["992e15d16d509dd113c7f535e2e31dd2fc1f02b1"],"title":"Robust model fitting for the non linear structural equation model under normal theory.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X345966"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":1999,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of econometrics","paperAbstract":"This paper contains a Monte Carlo evaluation of estimators used to control for endogeneity of dummy explanatory variables in continuous outcome regression models. When the true model has bivariate normal disturbances, estimators using discrete factor approximations compare favorably to efficient estimators in terms of precision and bias; these approximation estimators dominate all the other estimators examined when the disturbances are non-normal. The experiments also indicate that one should liberally add points of support to the discrete factor distribution. The paper concludes with an application of the discrete factor approximation to the estimation of the impact of marriage on wages.","inCitations":["eeb6972cf1fb30e3ce5d94c55a0b71f4fafbfd59","a851b4701ec05d21b6d27f63ebc9a065dca2331e","a987d4a6f7256529704c728d772225746371f2fa","00c8a1d992d6c2110c500aa8438f447b006cb96e","4494ffc906ad94b397c732f8d594144664382b17","1841ac72d8a9e4fe5de75a58637bcdc53c22a01d","689b1b766b0c2769d3a9b66835f20e390c411369","44490d334895a94d51ff5a6b8d8ef9c8f4ea294e","81e617fbc34f9776352346c666ffb38936ae4245","06fe6dda6bf4ebf0e0e8751aa245bdee896e7483","dc2f36fd1148585039feeb5766c9fb5b68b0b9d9","cb1445cdfa306336b1c9d486f6e389080703781e","f1c1c2ba8733ef7b63c66a9983051310308970dd","9e9f108edb131eaf0dd53296d746eff89d315b81","409ab43bfd6796789781403bc81720da1fe0048d","da939e55611332dbfbdae8eabf0a469e1d1c4958","82f2647bcf5f6f0562ed1c2118aee744dac675b6","06e2a108697730d8dcd7de4f6b59803b079016dc","82809ddae2a5619b77ab17f62e6590d83294752f","f5a676b8f1a5bf3f90593b164c118b5cfcf45c86","578d7edd681e55576caf818c725fbc60decc3a41","106ddc9b797e2692e0731c3e71c72ae65800b6fd","c94a166a894a9225eb38ad479bd51cbac427c81f","68493cac139216625c3ebd7290811e279b5bac4d","c706894ccef4aaa0cddcaf1b2a80d5aa64bf3e89","470c757f389b5a694f9fedd080d3409d0776563e","3405fd523c1b5d34200da198516e3e619fc8b522","659fc11bb7aba1f858fafb5a9e2e1f236d219d60","ced4fac453d0a300aa73ea813cceabb4758bc144","787bf8825fc76b2f7024034e74ec30381997db46","cb35e84d5400c74be31fdcdf23066b78ea81595e","56ab2ebf5d57130f67a2d4f7b04e30e2bfc37f3f","34ee7806de3e1f76042d2a102562ece2cb74b4c7","281ddf202e8cdace65fa5ec48492960e709ff93e","20117eb10e4884f73ca1ffeb9d3ef868cbd4fe56","8b654a5f7fc7ff1f0db51180db998a835766ed2f","d59ac963bb7a5d5e3d8f6b5e16d48e84af0b2774","9ec958d8267397b2e9299dbebc734e82d6726271","696885acb4de3268b1831c1b16bdd1bbf41db224","2c2cf08a4300fa3ed90f83939e8d46686d7ab59d","57b4f3613cc3e337f5c21293f8ecd3ef043154d2","360d9bd9513d0b4ad27dcd815cd6871b8497a934","f162a400e23bd637e08dca1995846e177138b20b","ce32ede3942d3f03c1855c4141b148336b704248","027c12e2bb3c8e3bbd67763cb0b6f405947c67fa","63be6cadb6e13f874c7c7af2e69ec17dd6c60294","94e01e3a06d0a5d418cf3bef8810e215ccc19955","104ad10b72ec661792faccdf43a774b7f4aa6a81","0de69a9533cf25141d5b64743250a6fe284b589c","f8a37fdb09f67643ee394f46d85bf2946fef4199","34ce9362d22480f72f3dadf30f69db202c052f6a","b1af833bc3d511512edd4a2cf9c8593b84302ccc","0830363bee0f2cba9b7b751c53f2f01014a34052","63083a9ab9c49aa592aba027b90970c75c1c990a","3c64c6f0757cbf709c4c1c31b2c68e346e345ea2","e274edddae0a24750241d21906d0fb96990092b0","9c1e4b96b194c993e6d696f18bf6fc7985e43f7b","63279334474cf92d596b863faab0e35a6eeb3c7e","a72c1e9ffaa6e01c3d94600b3f567477fe22619f","1341f430cbb6020a663aeed3afbe5687a36b4be2","b1d51141494427bbcd1694dba6b9de394dde0fb1","a91dda456af0e89e6713448edd14471d36812117","758ccae3e9989aa27613c4cf5752b30a4e13f712","d47a6eded26d10e44807a6eb900552764b9679a1","ff81a5f1e50f5692934ac74eed643559c54f52be","b14d2e00f8a6401100b2e8adb75e04644e070aec","c0e898422cd79085ce2e481ae8cd2af00efedc99","e1a17f99b41a014b4ecdf340c585a94c8e988448","e15b649fee126e155d87c4c600f45c335b93535d","459d7c72fcfdf7bbbb73c7f774b549a79679e731","c523d7fa57e7e545450864ec992231f40b9f92f3","0c2cebd9843564ba6213060443c61694b7cc554e","29b88360615cfd7341654011b65254f3990ff4a9","ffb0f06cc08128f438f58a4a4cc46a477e5aea84","23c97bf519412b86edfe112c20110730b933d505","819653a5ef990b3a85a6d23e08c5f0f35720e320","1c2dee533b075d3645d52135d9a4701bc0397f5f","4ff8f81326ab75b5014dcb4eb135cdf205b3a865","0531c40ca52ceab5c909959fefab24d462735794","f95de34474a02a5a588339aa1679b1813d9fb0d8","4e850cfce0066cf95ebef42be4478bf6ac3a1583","9709d46a02f7195c324bf1aeedb34f348af208f3","fcbd5164bcdc52f0361fca94891e77f79d6ce485","619cb90bbef0b5e08994cd78af8ca763d4b9bf27","05b0ffc6c0c7ac86b2534cf64e724b33ca49b4ff","8f9aa3a54909b427c593bfca44f742cd23a3e0e0","b71ae50879d977eadd0592b011cd25643b1b5153","9181201fb0ba9142d9b6f74110f71e76fcf701e2","6dcde5b115ec6d9854cdbe386032b84b539c92d2","7f4530b07f4952c27d53f731c209b8b07fdabe6a","f5e84091cca95f4874476096f72625b2ef722dc9","bdf209890e19782187853ce54efba3e7b9d0610e","0f7fe7a14934d294425a3512b099cd866e28112a","575d3c646abb13f384216b6217e358a70f7971e6","058efc0bd8842b6cc432889c312d8a24ab365e13","e6b50fce30ca51fded28a6a7f579828707fa54d0","f9ff77c936aebce6b35fa963792609861b152a23","8a2636a7b2097fee5153dffd024e1716659f2551","dfd6b135333b1c77731b491c9095d07253ed7753","54752d4007a21ba7673d0475d756cea65991188e","648ab86afa894753caa47c72748c8abcf750bd9c","9620dcacd648982a8f16cdf569d1fb743ab41ed2","5d6b748f4ec23ad46aaea086d8592dcab39cf29f","bfbd996a15e7d2f4c44bb3367644acf7cc095b32","05617615a7c1033b49bafb407eba9e1e49599726","f26a6d9147295306d0626dfdf2bf7baeea7e4b9d","f8eb80f1e1b82e3d85804ef7b684250a77df8a1c","82d794ab7327e97916136ffa2090b40dcd3c62ff","c3ace05e3a7794af17d884d716b786d1d18df2e8","a623ba7adc5a78bcda6b4abcb6ee74f88a30a9a1","0545a6c5dc6e20433fb4abca7adfdab25f166778","46eafc3c0f37326189485ae2a6b9af53a3eb2b52","ca7f99a715fc00180cc09c6a7e5533dd475687bb","37adf124a3cced3a03153ddc16c8fa862eaa7083","eadf795899d01658c8764addc9721ada7ab8a8c0","af29b45e0e672a5dd31206f6cfc5d83

However, the fundamental belief in the medical literature was called into serious question by a paper suggesting that most published medical research is false. Here we adapt estimation methods from the genomics community to the problem of estimating the rate of false discoveries in the medical literature using reported $P$-values as the data. We then collect $P$-values from the abstracts of all 77 430 papers published in The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The British Medical Journal, and The American Journal of Epidemiology between 2000 and 2010. Among these papers, we found 5322 reported $P$-values. We estimate that the overall rate of false discoveries among reported results is 14% (s.d. 1%), contrary to previous claims. We also found that there is no a significant increase in the estimated rate of reported false discovery results over time (0.5% more false positives (FP) per year, $P = 0.18$) or with respect to journal submissions (0.5% more FP per 100 submissions, $P = 0.12$). Statistical analysis must allow for false discoveries in order to make claims on the basis of noisy data. But our analysis suggests that the medical literature remains a reliable record of scientific progress.","inCitations":["79c34e11c81754607e33f8ea99de7b5599362c1d","b9ca417f2cd929dbc47578e5ec1820d5d00c33db","a6beda91090825037ba7b11646c6040c4d5c61cb","d6aeb5e464617dfc566c68e51d299318ba1a76de","962c03f8b4870e5567181e3d8777bd5c31a197de","901746270e9cd4d4a11118b9d633961b8285bc92","233c18ff7f83d294a8cf762632faf966e3df4053","1868ab043e92bb4d40714d6b2c93c22af5bb630b","300cf52aa9665bf929ca0c22587bc449333da3db","14d840d74b653175609f5a75fceaf43e458c325d","276feb251fa166d9776a5927e88181fc486600b8","9176a86996dbe84b3a2fca7a5dca6a9860f0c37c","ba74d0bfdb58cb19177d64aa57ab03f5d0af7734","abb6ad761c39983224ab1e7d165dc66c987c06ad","67c2f46d18e625b306980dc76cc8f7c5d90a652c","48240ae5a4a27dd474a0b21bd2496e286318c3a4","0e16a834632c2b54e746b1851afc1f3beccb1e53","105a19431ddfcfd2e6195176059a49c3232ddda4","7edfa14793fecf57a03b827bbfe71d4dcff08ae0","163644b10bea139642a549f313a7d7dc662a530f","95854baeacaed5b9294f7dc39a1991e7b26055c9","f4feb17a69ba3349daa0c2ec17b9e42246d80f50","713ec657e33fb336432500d4e8f53208b5694f14","fbb17a0446f3db65efb4f6b6c4be969271d8ab1b","c62f226df3068a95072c4e851e23fd01d5366832","dd052de79364d4e186f9cbb67e990426f9a5f054","167c6c2459625faee69a820f0c1778ea72098083","9bb149ad986fa7fcb38d10133ae8c073a09a5a63","f46938aabd77e41424fc766820ba77b0e21aba08","df4c369b984524801d47ad2ef7a0f52829a43c5c","d5c6f74eacb196b4c6806618e051898a32b6e768","b8d0f0b7385eef0f73d6d36f53d1596754acf402","9da94acbc8f407b0ef29abf15c440fd1b613592a","479a565b678c78881326bcdb074c24bead02d883","655df5aef04f64103917835dcbfa3028d4acfdb6","6ea766aeb895a2f3c99d33d120412e4f5ff1a5f5","2bf3c9fc1d2c8daa0fed9018635f6c44a98388ff","a07a64ba110e0f9f7156f3bd1e376f0d2e1cddf1","dbb1ac5e1bea606d81f8e810549d7f712862a249","c13b63929a50ba932d82d502db326f712e64caeb","0764a3e911ff2a57af424a40e5946a98f54128a8","599d491a210c7fe7fb8983d933ba2f6bc22cc69a","c0a972504fc44a45ca1f78f54cd938042f164f6c","39eae87d7b18ac870459bbdb88c72f97d37b5012","2f05f3598b701d1d02db0746b2068986a82084fb","2b2d6039a8d5f7bc3956babe312b9119bc46df82","ac8fcb36684540d1a4014dad76264cbb7f9a1735","2cddbbdf1554b967f7c5a5d3cdbb9d62bf389f33","0ffcc91d965fd0ae36bc8464d94fbcdf9dae1084","5f61ca1180f833e96afebe4ac293b5ac79d13f11","ac064597f706c78007d05d0663b9ab751cdba93d","336a7975604b5065f596cd0fac53d0f004178cad","5ba9b4b324e50ff00071bfe39b797b36bd3577b5","c200905c35e9c7ab1e84efbd4d0c61d5b68b8017","ce09756831edccfa2abe748eac338fc66b0357df","f1a76cbd7a9520867f4e347b09973a01aa9bd751","e4a40361684b7562195db97364c3cede74295417","f27fd0fc5424643203dc7d48e6ba2e5ca4e94775","8a27d26773702000a14173517ba67bbf45d60315","770350d8acdd59b4f82baf5be60c9283610f65cc","2d5917a52b1e074340ab142d25fc05b9e5eda383","e044257d4711d9608ea7e1762f368018242d192d","80af7bd0e442627c83fbbdc0bd277e71b143e2e0","b1b4866881b896aa4fae73d440b928365b3e1e9f","4110fd67a667d73335115d99304f7855569e9e1e","3bc79c54d3d052a4451adcec4110433abc9b72ca","38bd59a72cab916550e9ed7f189b5ef32a73a4e6","f56425ec56586dcfd2694ab83643e9e76f314e91","582f85f0248c1496ae067cdb6cf2b6f9f134d929","f518dd991220b085a5984a081f1d28ca94af7a51"],"title":"An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt007"}

Parameters of the composite direct product model for a 6-variable MTMM matrix were estimated using the Maximum Wishart Likelihood (MWL), generalized least squares (GLS), asymptotically distribution free (ADF), and approximate ADF (DADF) estimators. Browne's elliptical correction (CMWL) to the test statistic and standard errors for scale-invariant models was also made for each sample. Each of the 32 distribution-sample size conditions was replicated 300 times. The accuracy of the parameter estimates and estimated standard errors and the distribution of the test statistic were studied. The theoretically predicted importance of information contained in higher-order moments of arbitrary distributions was confirmed. Robustness of the MWL and normal theory GLS estimators cannot be taken for granted. Elliptical corrections may be a practical solution to some data analytic problems.","inCitations":["b3e2caad719c9f129419355c55376e9fe41105f0","7d793f4e14059e9169e26be4ac14e856ec8bb390","73e94555b7d47018eae2b79cc3379f1823d83c01","27e0e266c2c149d28ce22e7322713b8b3c68c636","ef639631f66e1e685973271f0eafd0984a34783d","c419f1663c0d1020f805a4eb7ed84bab37dfc350","b2e5a89b744bb9615791485bb436170aaea39709","f76dc101f779f7cd2128345fb7e16116fdaaa27c","6b34e1b084235ca54f291ed9169aa94b95dbf2d6"],"title":"Robustness of some estimators for the analysis of covariance structures.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1993.tb01019.x"}

The increasing number of HIV-infected subjects starting therapy and the limited capacity to support CD4 count testing within resource-limited settings have fueled interest in identifying correlates of CD4 count change such as total lymphocyte count, among others. The application of modeling techniques will be essential to this endeavor due to the typically non-linear CD4 trajectory over time and the multiple input variables necessary for capturing CD4 variability. We propose a prediction based classification approach that involves first stage modeling and subsequent classification based on clinically meaningful thresholds. This approach draws on existing analytical methods described in the receiver operating characteristic curve literature while presenting an extension for handling a continuous outcome. Application of this method to an independent test sample results in greater than 98% positive predictive value for CD4 count change. The prediction algorithm is derived based on a cohort of n = 270 HIV-1 infected individuals from the Royal Free Hospital, London who were followed for up to three years from initiation of ART. A test sample comprised of n = 72 individuals from Philadelphia and followed for a similar length of time is used for validation. Results suggest that this approach may be a useful tool for prioritizing limited laboratory resources for CD4 testing after subjects start antiretroviral therapy.","inCitations":["2c22a0392842da82f3d3facd37344692aa953375","2d35680bafc6bec5ee836b10899e1894faf50c78","9b5a3c53962b51c6ea26bb4e6555d7010b9535ef"],"title":"Prediction based classification for longitudinal biomarkers.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS326"}

The aim of this paper is to develop diagnostic measures for identifying influential observations of different kinds. Three diagnostic measures, based on the local influence approach, are constructed to identify observations that exercise undue influence on the estimate of mu of Sigma, and of both together.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"year":2010,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Electronic journal of statistics","paperAbstract":"We introduce models for the analysis of functional data observed at multiple time points. The dynamic behavior of functional data is decomposed into a time-dependent population average, baseline (or static) subject-specific variability, longitudinal (or dynamic) subject-specific variability, subject-visit-specific variability and measurement error. The model can be viewed as the functional analog of the classical longitudinal mixed effects model where random effects are replaced by random processes. Methods have wide applicability and are computationally feasible for moderate and large data sets. Computational feasibility is assured by using principal component bases for the functional processes. The methodology is motivated by and applied to a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study designed to analyze differences and changes in brain connectivity in healthy volunteers and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

However, there is a relative paucity of research comparing these methods directly to one another. In this study, we compare various approaches to estimating a causal effect in a longitudinal treatment setting using both simulated data and data measured from a human immunodeficiency virus cohort. Six distinct estimators are considered: (i) an iterated conditional expectation representation, (ii) an inverse propensity weighted method, (iii) an augmented inverse propensity weighted method, (iv) a double robust iterated conditional expectation estimator, (v) a modified version of the double robust iterated conditional expectation estimator, and (vi) a targeted minimum loss-based estimator. The details of each estimator and its implementation are presented along with nuisance parameter estimation details, which include potentially pooling the observed data across all subjects regardless of treatment history and using data adaptive machine learning algorithms. Simulations are constructed over six time points, with each time point steadily increasing in positivity violations. Estimation is carried out for both the simulations and applied example using each of the six estimators under both stratified and pooled approaches of nuisance parameter estimation. Simulation results show that double robust estimators remained without meaningful bias as long as at least one of the two nuisance parameters were estimated with a correctly specified model. Under full misspecification, the bias of the double robust estimators remained better than that of the inverse propensity estimator under misspecification, but worse than the iterated conditional expectation estimator. Weighted estimators tended to show better performance than the covariate estimators. As positivity violations increased, the mean squared error and bias of all estimators considered became worse, with covariate-based double robust estimators especially susceptible. Applied analyses showed similar estimates at most time points, with the important exception of the inverse propensity estimator which deviated markedly as positivity violations increased. Given its efficiency, ability to respect the parameter space, and observed performance, we recommend the pooled and weighted targeted minimum loss-based estimator.","inCitations":["56c27592ccbbdea7d3670c37ccb890841ca60dff","df41c4f5aa934861c524f22273fba05219174788"],"title":"Double Robust Efficient Estimators of Longitudinal Treatment Effects: Comparative Performance in Simulations and a Case Study","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2017-0054"}

Interest lies in estimating the rate of progression through each state while incorporating covariates that might affect the transition rates. We develop a Bayesian discrete-time multistate growth model for inference from cross-sectional data with unknown initiation times. For each subject, data are collected at only one time point at which we observe the state as well as covariates that measure developmental progress. We link the developmental progress variables to an underlying latent growth variable that can also affect the state transition rates. A subject with slow latent growth will then have relatively small developmental progress covariates and move through state transitions slowly. We then examine the association between latent growth and the probability of future events in a novel study of embryonic development and pregnancy loss. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for posterior computation, we found evidence in favor of a previously hypothesized but unproven association between slow growth early in pregnancy and increased risk of future spontaneous abortion.","inCitations":["ecd696e0a2abccd256478fc766c2dbbce118a398","b752bab67777d7758fd648e0028dbecccc38998b","4a168593d2ac8c347693109da9ba864422f0ca9f"],"title":"Bayesian modeling of embryonic growth using latent variables.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm040"}

Our motivation is prompted by the fact that most current statistical procedures used in the analysis of randomized multi-center studies are model based. The randomization feature of the trials is usually ignored. An important characteristic of model based analysis is that it is straightforward to model covariates. Nevertheless in nearly all model based analyses, the effects due to different centers and, in general, the design of the clinical trials are ignored. An alternative to a model based analysis is to have analyses guided by the design of the trial. Our development of design based methods allows the incorporation of centers as well as other features of the trial design. The methods make use of conditioning on the ancillary statistics in the sample space generated by the randomization process. We have investigated the power of the methods and have found that, in the presence of center variation, there is a significant increase in power. The methods have been extended to group sequential trials with similar increases in power.","inCitations":["21102b4aa80b3d8d1a9671cf7f3722e041febf24","4fdc816f317b6ad372defc8af18c3cec0370173c","cc84d920bb6a29f9d1e59df6cda50c66b7590dd0","7fbf116029b30055f163bbbdf28ee82638619012","87dc062269a3c38fd838fb33b99713646c59676c","ca49731c8c15f8aebfc6f62e74a965378664e58e","143e39e7d6d32934707bab8e10a543e9ca700511","82fe6a56fed17eeb942c42f5bdc15f18d510ae59","c20b07f24f30d993eaccb433b5bf36ba8818c387","51a5826cd1cf16426a40e3e75f08636ff8a4a77e","f293b67927c1291183c83ed75c73ed8a4d2d4591","81a10af6d1cd17ed65976603e916593950ab439f"],"title":"Multi-center Clinical Trials: Randomization and Ancillary Statistics.","doi":"10.1214/07-AOAS151"}

The graphical lasso, which involves maximizing the Gaussian log likelihood subject to a lasso penalty, is a well-studied approach for this task. A surprising connection between the graphical lasso and hierarchical clustering is introduced: the graphical lasso in effect performs a two-step procedure, in which (1) single linkage hierarchical clustering is performed on the variables in order to identify connected components, and then (2) a penalized log likelihood is maximized on the subset of variables within each connected component. Thus, the graphical lasso determines the connected components of the estimated network via single linkage clustering. The single linkage clustering is known to perform poorly in certain finite-sample settings. Therefore, the cluster graphical lasso, which involves clustering the features using an alternative to single linkage clustering, and then performing the graphical lasso on the subset of variables within each cluster, is proposed. Model selection consistency for this technique is established, and its improved performance relative to the graphical lasso is demonstrated in a simulation study, as well as in applications to a university webpage and a gene expression data sets.","inCitations":["69eac15d73fae091eea170ef1c3652bca57d8f8d","2ba6685cc139a01817a4a903eabb9ea283ab704b","19831805303d2860392b6e0118a4495db28b7607","4b358245e89fb7678340641f1b5760f9940e32f7","38e4f95c4bb6af894e0e1e62d140af2de7b8db0e","4539c81d9c93d21d95ae7acc13d0c30b26913c74","7f456f969568625f75288917adf25510cf2f3321","488355b9218649a36ea0fc8303696e383a3eb791","df7805037088cca14a24deebe8482161687c44d4","921ecf429e304868301dd91bc2ebb69fadd0097d","ab50d8661b6575502b87582d157987fb4de83ba0","6d3a334900aefbf6e3e52f3fdd03c8c3219e07a9","2148a906b30147621f98f08c0bd1ce100f9a7870","00be91da7153a994997b6cfbc2ea92f61f68eeb3","d87abf4d1888a95a31fe763675681c530e5532e5","0269d926ef001c62f81e5da4c4b34b3122397014","634c0c19690e136a727fb5bb820912ac6e5e37c0","1c353d9d8e637e3fc613badbb7843dd7379a691e","06382f14850c7978f384986263242fa3691dd4c3","b59da6a22e1b0c6ae43ee84194e4b46d5da22356","549b2687f4ae85e45b20cc212e161779f2037dab","63ddb39a7ae38a662c57dd931ce46f1b0b5e12a8","8de40116407685587d8387ec2fdf61abab9dbc3f","c11c847e26a8943c2e9fcc86e643301f84361829","6f9fcd930c267d5ea31fd085508dbe138524a184","7dd2d85c5e4dbf3411d700416b7a8e1b4f48d34b","cb1a372b2cf9e860bc0c9f413d0a79cf67a17fed"],"title":"The cluster graphical lasso for improved estimation of Gaussian graphical models","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2014.11.015"}

In the algorithm, rectangular sampling domains are layered on top of each other (resembling a ziggurat) to encapsulate the desired probability density function. Random values within these layers are sampled and then returned if they lie beneath the graph of the probability density function. Here, we present an implementation where ziggurat layers reside completely beneath the probability density function, thereby eliminating the need for any rejection test within the ziggurat layers. In the new algorithm, small overhanging segments of probability density remain to the right of each ziggurat layer, which can be efficiently sampled with triangularly-shaped sampling domains. Median runtimes of the new algorithm for exponential and normal variates is reduced to 58% and 53% respectively (collective range: 41-93%).

Four procedures were shown to be conservative, while the fifth provided adequate control of Type I errors only for restricted values of sample size ratios. No procedure was found to be uniformly most powerful. The Tukey-Kramer procedure was found to provide the best any-pair power provided it is applied without requiring a significant overall F test. In most cases, the Hayter-Fisher modification of the Tukey-Kramer was found to provide very good any-pair power and to be uniformly more powerful than the Tukey-Kramer when a significant overall F test is required.

Despite its usefulness, the traditional maximum likelihood estimation for multi-group latent growth modelling is not feasible when one of the groups has no response at any given data collection point, or when all participants within a group have the same response at one of the time points. In other words, multi-group latent growth modelling requires a complete covariance structure for each observed group. The primary purpose of the present study is to show how to circumvent these data problems by developing a simple but creative approach using an existing estimation procedure for growth mixture modelling. A Monte Carlo simulation study was carried out to see whether the modified estimation approach provided tangible results and to see how these results were comparable to the standard multi-group results. The proposed approach produced results that were valid and reliable under the mentioned problematic data conditions. We also present a real data example and demonstrate that the proposed estimation approach can be used for the chi-square difference test to check various types of measurement invariance as conducted in a standard multi-group analysis.","inCitations":["cbb8cb65c2be1dcf2ed7fe0c5b4be9a86a7ac080","66e8b9cbc221d4b9ea21e2bf3e3de93877c5ba5a","d10ab920eed8358eb0b6a876d59e6901f424f42a"],"title":"Using mixture models with known class membership to address incomplete covariance structures in multiple-group growth models.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12008"}

A mistake that is sometimes encountered in the analysis of such data is to ignore the effect of clustering and analyse the data as if it were based on a simple random sample. This typically leads to an overstatement of the precision of results and too liberal conclusions about precision and statistical significance of mean differences. This paper gives simple corrections to the test statistics that would be computed in an analysis of variance if clustering were (incorrectly) ignored. The corrections are multiplicative factors depending on the total sample size, the cluster size, and the intraclass correlation structure. For example, the corrected F statistic has Fisher's F distribution with reduced degrees of freedom. The corrected statistic reduces to the F statistic computed by ignoring clustering when the intraclass correlations are zero. It reduces to the F statistic computed using cluster means when the intraclass correlations are unity, and it is in between otherwise. A similar adjustment to the usual statistic for testing a linear contrast among group means is described.","inCitations":["cdbf6474cbc07c34c3fb3173418cd185bef33e80","30048b476cdaf426e313e3994fc316502ccd90d4","1829270f1b4e8866ef9bfdfdb4b6f286c74c8a77","47473aff9507d501abcbe0e2ddfb028451d6da4f","fe4b3b2cf2d5ef4c1c5ecc59cbd2af98f91f1961","3496445959d1373e0a400ceb454560ad40371436","ed8ea75fb452f9abc299530c9099891f8448a684"],"title":"Correcting an analysis of variance for clustering.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2010.02005.x"}

To evaluate and compare these procedures, modeling uncertainty caused by model selection and parameter estimation has to be assessed and integrated into a modeling process. To do this, a data perturbation method estimates the modeling uncertainty inherited in a selection process by perturbing the data. Critical to data perturbation is the size of perturbation, as the perturbed data should resemble the original dataset. To account for the modeling uncertainty, we derive the optimal size of perturbation, which adapts to the data, the model space, and other relevant factors in the context of linear regression. On this basis, we develop an adaptive data-perturbation method that, unlike its nonadaptive counterpart, performs well in different situations. This leads to a data-adaptive model selection method. Both theoretical and numerical analysis suggest that the data-adaptive model selection method adapts to distinct situations in that it yields consistent model selection and optimal prediction, without knowing which situation exists a priori. The proposed method is applied to real data from the commodity market and outperforms its competitors in terms of price forecasting accuracy.","inCitations":["61a207da55c2d881ea5c4de9dc86304542d66fd6"],"title":"Adaptive Modeling Procedure Selection by Data Perturbation.","doi":"10.1080/07350015.2014.965307"}

There is great interest in estimating the rates of disease at given future time-points in order that plans can be made for the provision of the required future services. In the setting of using age-period-cohort models incorporating restricted cubic splines, a new technique for projecting incidence is proposed. The new technique projects the period and cohort terms linearly from 10 years within the range of the available data in order to give projections that are based on recent trends. The method is validated via a comparison with existing methods in the setting of Finnish cancer registry data. The reasons for the improvements seen for the newly proposed method are twofold. Firstly, improvements are seen due to the finer splitting of the timescale to give a more continuous estimate of the incidence rate. Secondly, the new method uses more recent trends to dictate the future projections than previously proposed methods.","inCitations":["345384b436e64a2ea7ac0faaf197056a88a678f2","7895890a68fc93336cf8e6bb3f8187dbaf0ccfbd","8e76ab95e0a76e6a3a715edffa69f512aca5526e","c6f7713a7e4b66eb5939f7d9847be93ce5e549ad","5ddcc10f3c4bb312e27072b577190db71d2cc40c","1a769632f3d2140c06df92fb5a98ea166fb9e24d","0d8d66aca9dd684148fdbf7d8dc91b38b484aae0","ddd73510c7d070ef6704043df9203e38c7a05ee6"],"title":"Projecting Cancer Incidence using Age-period-cohort Models Incorporating Restricted Cubic Splines","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1411"}

A recent approach to analyse such data is weighted estimating equations (Robins, J. M., Rotnitzky, A. and Zhao, L. P. (1994), JASA, 89, 846-866, and Zhao, L. P., Lipsitz, S. R. and Lew, D. (1996), Biometrics, 52, 1165-1182). With weighted estimating equations, the contribution to the estimating equation from a complete observation is weighted by the inverse of the probability of being observed. We propose a test statistic to assess if the weighted estimating equations produce biased estimates. Our test statistic is similar to the test statistic proposed by DuMouchel and Duncan (1983) for weighted least squares estimates for sample survey data. The method is illustrated using data from a randomized clinical trial on chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.","inCitations":["905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","7346e0ed0c98a318be33a0c54aef8e7ed039d164"],"title":"Testing for bias in weighted estimating equations.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/2.3.295"}

In this paper, we discuss whether the information about the ratio of true positive rates and the ratio of false positive rates of two qualitative tests, T(New) and T(Old), is sufficient to draw a conclusion about effectiveness of the T(New). We show that if there is a statistically significant increase in true positive rates and the increase in true positive rates is statistically larger than increase in false positive rates, then a conclusion about effectiveness of test T(New) can be made and this does not require application of the reference standard to the subjects with negative results by both tests.
