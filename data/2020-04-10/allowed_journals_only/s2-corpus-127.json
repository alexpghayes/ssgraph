Multivariate phenotypes are frequently encountered in genetic association studies. The purpose of analyzing multivariate phenotypes usually includes discovery of novel genetic variants of pleiotropy effects, that is, affecting multiple phenotypes, and the ultimate goal of uncovering the underlying genetic mechanism. In recent years, there have been new method development and application of existing statistical methods to such phenotypes. In this paper, we provide a review of the available methods for analyzing association between a single marker and a multivariate phenotype consisting of the same type of components (e.g., all continuous or all categorical) or different types of components (e.g., some are continuous and others are categorical). We also reviewed causal inference methods designed to test whether the detected association with the multivariate phenotype is truly pleiotropy or the genetic marker exerts its effects on some phenotypes through affecting the others.","inCitations":["82aba97cd31511bf9f75c531d9430277889bd5a6","45c57594e2e0405485864cd5c4c7b88b9c0ea051","7f0fe98a344f912deafb5acd5ec2d184508516ac","c3a47218cacbebd6581a2b10eda4c414f97318fb","83e98797873f34d123f89538cf292c3eb8900a9a","024122a585184ae8cb22dd3e71563c706a8ae2ea","97bb92c33e5174bfdf02cdc2e9bc134f64c031ae","82a36ae0416de306b698e9256a3fd607c0cfa018","48d56b8e5e41b60c6b7ee971e484efeb576c20ea","7aade503817858d3e8006e2e472296a000e170a0","fa2aea25fd69f2dec5f7872d8de662f69fd68ff6","e61d51e440d456ab6147177b574d62b6a7f51be0","e20d354a482ebed08377eca659f9964093d05ff7","4869766013bdacf642ac37edd128157a13119c5e","f2723b87bf17140f8da8c14132ac3e49472e664e","a10d1bf9f2bd86ebf6a1c3de88b22ced9185cc9b","b291e14d127022c7c15c7462924e639b8acfdef1","6ccd1fc0f41b0c2cdb5760f11a3217c193b72cdc","f5ec22adde1900d27a783d87f81c62bc338f1ebf","381750409f91dc00bc583d5d8b192a1f2c629ca1","e31ada74da16b4faf06ff3653993579d076a837b","421e66116e0ac1eeed8f5e5430ba0a99a2d70174","43c8b95dbd4f7c19417e3bfbaa85d564700ec82b","2eb235c4f438533cee8f6dc5a76fe02a0007d0f5","a9e556c8281add65e450096c812b4360cc645434","2b995a82eec5d243def36e2af79a1ac55eea5b8d","d23a4dfd71e26e5d8ee7768869996006d2034e5a","0c022b643c570ea6dbc66d207cb92c5cb9ed84c9","ec87302e4c336fd9d733f2498191d6853fac488c","e1317dca13f4a47a667f5e117af24619062b778a","1b371d20c2e765ad5680273d9b6367bbbdf2652a","ae3b960ae029920b036c49cd5816d6cbf1e384a1","893280429c6a393bcafd8fe4d22d1bdd70271099","484083325bd3026f5de3a166052ee425eefda0b5","4094cab8325fbc38fdba5c1dd1fe0aebdb7d6898","926a84f0325306c6eb4e060ef9044ce556a45452","c34a866e188cfe79d748e772645c060bb385b155","bfed4a141b80c3938ab62940d839be317ba4e627","2dc4fc6f54bd8cb4e1e24ea1d3907bcfa4083598","3a670a3793585f232f07141b503a79f82423533a"],"title":"Methods for Analyzing Multivariate Phenotypes in Genetic Association Studies.","doi":"10.1155/2012/652569"}

Scientists may use a two-step approach for testing hypotheses about Gaussian mean vectors. In the first step, principal components analysis (PCA) selects a set of sample components fewer in number than the sample size. In the second step, applying classical multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) methods to the reduced set of variables provides the desired hypothesis tests. Simulation results presented here indicate that success of the PCA in the first step requires nearly all variation to occur in population components far fewer in number than the number of subjects. In the second step, multivariate tests fail to attain reasonable power except in restrictive, favorable cases. The results encourage using other approaches discussed in the article to provide dependable hypothesis testing with high dimension, low sample size data (HDLSS).","inCitations":["4a69f2b2c31243ad5868e74401d0ad558dfe1849","1c4b148c1f9994d0d1cbe416b9f808bd321af4af","00822108ca176fbd1070a130344f4fb352a5afd9","0cbbd0f4038c54f51ce74d408c842db9e72254aa"],"title":"Two-Step Hypothesis Testing When the Number of Variables Exceeds the Sample Size","doi":"10.1080/03610918.2012.659819"}

In a two-armed clinical trial, these efficacy outcomes are often expressed in terms of the two treatment effect means or the proportions of treatment success. For several clinical trials, efficacy assessment could be based on different types of clinical outcomes. These outcomes might be both categorical and noncategorical. Therefore, it is desirable to have a statistical model that is flexible enough for combining clinical trial data of both outcomes across several trials or studies. We discuss a simple statistical model with a potential for such flexibility. We illustrate the use of the model by providing a couple of numerical examples on the meta-analyses of efficacy data from prospective clinical trials/studies.","inCitations":["40f06efbee72fb1ccd9b26d4e27f5bf6bf0670d2","ef39c6c91b4fc1cf7695c331cb18f5fcc235e6ce","f153e5a120b906fcf9ce0b88a4e561a92fdee681"],"title":"On the utility of the Dirichlet distribution for meta-analysis of clinical studies.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101178"}

The last 10 years has witnessed considerable interest in the application of experimental design theories to population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments. Design of population pharmacokinetic experiments involves selection and a careful balance of a number of design factors. Optimal design theory uses prior information about the model and parameter estimates to optimize a function of the Fisher information matrix to obtain the best combination of the design factors. This paper provides a review of the different approaches that have been described in the literature for optimal design of population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments. It describes options that are available and highlights some of the issues that could be of concern as regards practical application. It also discusses areas of application of optimal design theories in clinical pharmacology experiments. It is expected that as the awareness about the benefits of this approach increases, more people will embrace it and ultimately will lead to more efficient population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic experiments and can also help to reduce both cost and time during drug development.","inCitations":["a703b1ff3b81c531d68fe82b0fa50bf9c6e467d1","95d260d99536be2ebb2d2a036ca0d7b5830a8713","b1abe182f5f0bbf364b7688d26e6f74486e5ec2b","26d3d913103f00443e57e702be740a2061680e22","73e24d57c9d7879c1a163ad4d9441c9d4b8b16e3","dd33909ae4bca3e1b68624fe8aaf09ff01da3d1a","12aa15b72106c64b69f3f8e54740d6981e0551c6","95169360ef1df9dc606190e4b8c8fa0836d24c93","f1a8c894a12e2de6cc29a194c41aac64a687a7d1","cfccdb2462391c9a981cc6aee1c101e7d89cab07","fd21cc8d7baa8c2021905c596f47f7e6d54f8580","26b5162454e02008b2697d45677834f82b838bba","b969ce8edb9a75b5d92353fc24be9da230f03af2","8c8be13bca6c7ded51a205e9308122c2db6441ce","5131218dee16ae87503e38f5dbfeae86d37764a6"],"title":"Application of optimal design methodologies in clinical pharmacology experiments.","doi":"10.1002/pst.354"}

Examples for correlated binary data could be the binary assessments of subjects obtained by several raters in the framework of a clinical trial. This topic is especially of relevance when success criteria have to be defined for dedicated imaging trials involving several raters conducted for regulatory purposes. First, an analytical result on the expectation of the 'Majority rater' is presented when only the marginal distributions of the single raters are given. The paper provides a simulation study where all three analysis procedures are compared for a particular setting. It turns out that in many cases, 'Average rater' is associated with a gain in power. Settings were identified where 'Majority significant' has favorable properties. 'Majority rater' is in many cases difficult to interpret.","inCitations":["cecaaf57c327e42f286ab23e3873c526146751f0"],"title":"A comparison of analysis procedures for correlated binary data in dedicated multi-rater imaging trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1655"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Epidemiology studies increasingly examine multiple exposures in relation to disease by selecting the exposures of interest in a thematic manner. For example, sun exposure, sunburn, and sun protection behavior could be themes for an investigation of sun-related exposures. Several studies now use pre-defined linear combinations of the exposures pertaining to the themes to estimate the effects of the individual exposures. Such analyses may improve the precision of the exposure effects, but they can lead to inflated bias and type I errors when the linear combinations are inaccurate. We investigate preliminary test estimators and empirical Bayes type shrinkage estimators as alternative approaches when it is desirable to exploit the thematic choice of exposures, but the accuracy of the pre-defined linear combinations is unknown. We show that the two types of estimator are intimately related under certain assumptions. The shrinkage estimator derived under the assumption of an exchangeable prior distribution gives precise estimates and is robust to misspecifications of the user-defined linear combinations. The precision gains and robustness of the shrinkage estimation approach are illustrated using data from the SONIC study, where the exposures are the individual questionnaire items and the outcome is (log) total back nevus count.","inCitations":["ffa698280fbeea7b12467f1e969cc58896e99a37","1a1399aa951d4257687da16d2d963efab6f7927e","1badb2d02e07278cdfbd85ad4f1eab7c09449a9e","0f0c974af9b067ec589969579f14e738a69c9e44"],"title":"Properties of preliminary test estimators and shrinkage estimators for evaluating multiple exposures - Application to questionnaire data from the SONIC study.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2011.00762.x"}

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking

In this article, we extend this model to a more general situation in which longitudinal traits for each subject are measured at unequally spaced time intervals, different subjects have different measurement patterns, and the residual correlation within subjects is nonstationary. We derive an EM-simplex hybrid algorithm to estimate the allele frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium between QTL in the original population and parameters contained in the growth equation and in the covariance structure. A worked example of head circumference growth in 145 children is used to validate our extended model. A simulation study is performed to examine the statistical properties of the parameter estimation obtained from this example. Finally, we discuss the implications and extensions of our model for detecting QTL that affect growth trajectories.","inCitations":["e6e8ef833d6a7ab76234febb7da6881244a97f4e","3a0b9aff07fd766935a87ee3f169f0511fed153e","7c2c3d8b7403e9744ac7c5052f4e9b74f7dea59c","09461b447aef2b008eab1ceb0cda9e6ab49b2c7f","ad77f9ad7ccbeb95f7caee546e69de452d60a504","cd68bcace47488cfd177a3f0bbb91d3ebc603748"],"title":"A general model for detecting genetic determinants underlying longitudinal traits with unequally spaced measurements and nonstationary covariance structure.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi019"}

In this paper, a simulation study was conducted to compare the performance of seven estimators of these parameters under various realistic scenarios in psychology and related fields. Our results suggest that the number of studies (k) exerts the most important influence on the accuracy of the results, and that precise estimates of the heterogeneity variances and the model predictive power can only be expected with at least 20 and 40 studies, respectively. Increases in the average within-study sample size (N¯) also improved the results for all estimators. Some differences among the accuracy of the estimators were observed, especially under adverse (small k and N¯) conditions, while the results for the different methods tended to convergence for more optimal scenarios.","inCitations":["e5815ee73967c3595ea5054a79e065b5a5cc2873","b7ea2b178d4d1a1d1dc815ef02c93f1f35d71ad7","6170ecff0832c7e227dd385622394b1e15239b28","4eb585b1ea708d5a1af1ec7e3ab6b617010dabd4","60e00d754945e7829cae37e808ef75be45f71152","adf44529c0a42f745198eaa61c2f90d3d1f7f6b5","903b1ca300acbcc873c3a73f662ff88c9de2c0d0","392b1ecbd6183ac812e1c76a1ac6187f4bd7b459","476526ec64696c8ef725788ff6da060364634fde","e29449b73ae49823ab050b006e15f6eef0caadf1","e82bf3a9a16d60abaf36c560524b608ae7ef622f","3f479b103e543289097bf107dba3266b3e148a73","764a092772ac73c5bdfe134cf8451d0a697cec3f","5d41d6e0ff44c5e6f14863a63f4f774c3ab87676","f978b35754580d2d41c719b274eab58a49445479","5d1f4e7b139e0dd6e1bf347b01ca69de3b566030","26a50cb823e154fa142cf6a5a310c915b0a84b3d","3380e38940e1f7894097f987428005ba109ddf52","12ab0156dd67c6e6e149b7722c0cf7c2a2474ce7","dea6dee970687b21a7f7ce89438ea38ac7a96bee","b4fb5ca5acfb0073507f11753621b7e4976bc7e9","0af91617ee628131a5cff2a2767c9f16488e3250","748d92a72d2d13fc4b622b264ed35edc74a58fdf","638ba2a6132cdd4bfe26ae69aaaeb439c556fdfd","c1a85a6c8abeef6e9813bd705401ac3ba70dfac4","8d7c7a430066d873b587db81a979ec32e33969c2","8f090ccec1166119aa3ba08539e298f1019ad921","a5a0fd93272758a45d290e930517236035133a49","a31f2b902483cd76c1f2a340d3a5722e71bb0c1f","7fe2c0cde0c2c211dae34c50f1e2cc4d981082f0","4f7e868c570ac5bbada42794625674a63ca3010f","6983769cb7f721b5464b2aaf6d992f59be71ca29","c099e805af74d23c40b839cf347652fd7c36711f","b481c54675661f5fa289e12a4884fd0d6b33fbff","a775b76ba597320226f91a19e50a2476a4531047","d7aa8c4a9c7e91b4c94cc38f93a094802173fd59","96fdd9a5d9e5df3c4052d41eab39e3d673037078"],"title":"Estimation of the predictive power of the model in mixed-effects meta-regression: A simulation study.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12002"}

In this article, we propose 10 confidence-interval estimators for the rate ratio in incomplete matched-pair designs. A hybrid method that recovers variance estimates required for the rate ratio from the confidence limits for single proportions is proposed. It is noteworthy that confidence intervals based on this hybrid method have closed-form solution. The performance of the proposed confidence intervals is evaluated with respect to their exact coverage probability, expected confidence interval width, and distal and mesial noncoverage probability. The results show that the hybrid Agresti-Coull confidence interval based on Fieller's theorem performs satisfactorily for small to moderate sample sizes.

Generally speaking, DLMs can be applied to time‐series data where the current measure of an independent variable and its lagged measures collectively affect the current measure of a dependent variable. The corresponding distributed lag (DL) function represents the relationship between the lags and the coefficients of the lagged exposure variables. Common choices include polynomials and splines. On one hand, such a constrained DLM specifies the coefficients as a function of lags and reduces the number of parameters to be estimated; hence, higher efficiency can be achieved. On the other hand, under violation of the assumption about the DL function, effect estimates can be severely biased. In this article, we propose a general framework for shrinking coefficient estimates from an unconstrained DLM, that are unbiased but potentially inefficient, toward the coefficient estimates from a constrained DLM to achieve a bias‐variance trade‐off. The amount of shrinkage can be determined in various ways, and we explore several such methods: empirical Bayes‐type shrinkage, a hierarchical Bayes approach, and generalized ridge regression. We also consider a two‐stage shrinkage approach that enforces the effect estimates to approach zero as lags increase. We contrast the various methods via an extensive simulation study and show that the shrinkage methods have better average performance across different scenarios in terms of mean squared error (MSE). We illustrate the methods by using data from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) to explore the association between PMSymbol, O3, and SO2 on three types of disease event counts in Chicago, IL, from 1987 to 2000.

In particular, the question \"How reliable is the selection of those features?\" has proved difficult to address. In part, this difficulty arises from defining false discoveries in the classical, fully conditional sense, which is possible in low dimensions but does not scale well to high-dimensional settings. Here, we consider the analysis of marginal false discovery rates (mFDRs) for penalized regression methods. Restricting attention to the mFDR permits straightforward estimation of the number of selections that would likely have occurred by chance alone, and therefore provides a useful summary of selection reliability. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies demonstrate that this approach is quite accurate when the correlation among predictors is mild, and only slightly conservative when the correlation is stronger. Finally, the practical utility of the proposed method and its considerable advantages over other approaches are illustrated using gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and genome-wide association study data from the Myocardial Applied Genomics Network.","inCitations":["7381e4a51b42c1b044000566c78e8c9075327a89","03f357cd27f939342cd44c173b82b5f0fbb14c23","3b4c2ea7458cfddaf48b95e23444eaa1380b0d8a","48c365fb304da4cad6389df84d8dac2828724d77","b6022e3ac9c75ff6e098c574d4ee93cfd8846d4f","b5325b5301627600580a93798ccd01308d235e22","7ac54398e4bac7ff93313e34e19a6f2baa42f91b","9e8efd072240b6eeb6d39b82395a2ccb143d7774"],"title":"Marginal false discovery rates for penalized regression models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy004"}

Many clinical trials and longitudinal studies generate interval-censored data; one common example occurs in medical studies that entail periodic follow-up. In this article, we propose a survival forest method for interval-censored data based on the conditional inference framework. We describe how this framework can be adapted to the situation of interval-censored data. We show that the tuning parameters have a non-negligible effect on the survival forest performance and guidance is provided on how to tune the parameters in a data-dependent way to improve the overall performance of the method. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the proposed survival forest is at least as effective as a survival tree method when the underlying model has a tree structure, performs similarly to an interval-censored Cox proportional hazards model fit when the true relationship is linear, and outperforms the survival tree method and Cox model when the true relationship is nonlinear. We illustrate the application of the method on a tooth emergence data set.","inCitations":["fe9ee684ba4fd180135eb394c542d6f2fa08ba37"],"title":"An ensemble method for interval-censored time-to-event data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz025"}

We evaluate the robustness of prediction accuracy summaries, obtained from receiver operating characteristic curves and risk-reclassification methods, if events are not captured (i.e., \"false negatives\"). We derive estimators for sensitivity and specificity if misclassification is independent of marker values. In simulation studies, we quantify the potential for bias in prediction accuracy summaries if misclassification depends on marker values. We compare the accuracy of alternative prognostic models for 30-day all-cause hospital readmission among 4548 patients discharged from the University of Pennsylvania Health System with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Simulation studies indicate that if misclassification depends on marker values, then the estimated accuracy improvement is also biased, but the direction of the bias depends on the direction of the association between markers and the probability of misclassification. In our application, 29% of the 1143 readmitted patients were readmitted to a hospital elsewhere in Pennsylvania, which reduced prediction accuracy. Outcome misclassification can result in erroneous conclusions regarding the accuracy of risk-prediction models.","inCitations":["f586569e55ed6ced34247bf8a1b8547bf33632d2","d34cf7aadbfd1b0dc4e5f22d36632ddea1ebf18f","6d365ce4f2d5a772a3dc0ecd3de72af2c53a3f98","e6c91109ba82dbdf3f13b336025fbd27a88ca3ee","7ea4f01092e4d0faa8b4a2b88281c6e3906297a5","21eeccb1e0370f9bcb054871cee387133ec3c18c","0dd2526842e73980e268fc8fbc9f7b9f92184e54","ba3a0f3b5b153b714e84c85a54ec97151d552b72"],"title":"Evaluating Risk-prediction Models Using Data from Electronic Health Records.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS891"}

The criteria for assessment can correspond to excess risk of an adverse event or to a guideline for sufficient efficacy as in the case of vaccine trials. The proposed strategy is implemented through a set of interim analyses, and success for one or more of the less stringent criteria at an interim analysis can be the basis for a regulatory submission, whereas the clinical trial continues to accumulate information to address the more stringent, but not futile, criteria. Simulations show that the proposed strategy is satisfactory for control of type I error, sufficient power, and potential success at interim analyses when the true relative risk is more favorable than assumed for the planned sample size.","inCitations":["8f0c0356a3a1f663b06d83d5a847e0a8d1662f6c"],"title":"A multistage analysis strategy for a clinical trial to assess successively more stringent criteria for a primary endpoint with a low event rate.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1554"}

The current study extends this approach by illustrating that the third moment of regression residuals may also be used to derive conclusions concerning the direction of effects. Assuming non-normally distributed variables, it is shown that the distribution of residuals of the correctly specified regression model (e.g., Y is regressed on X) is more symmetric than the distribution of residuals of the competing model (i.e., X is regressed on Y). Based on this result, 4 one-sample tests are discussed which can be used to decide which variable is more likely to be the response and which one is more likely to be the explanatory variable. A fifth significance test is proposed based on the differences of skewness estimates, which leads to a more direct test of a hypothesis that is compatible with direction of dependence. A Monte Carlo simulation study was performed to examine the behaviour of the procedures under various degrees of associations, sample sizes, and distributional properties of the underlying population. An empirical example is given which illustrates the application of the tests in practice.","inCitations":["6ec6d52cac023decbc1e3c600f71b12cbc7c1b76","ac4e298df66799f1dd4db7a5b3c457701d26162c","504ec00f9d960b45e788a02af6b1c916beac5710","20bbcfa9c02fd19fee5900a23a0a36d173a06904","ce3560dafbc0070920b333ff86c9d899fc23c5f4","cf34606d9f81c25ec71d1bdb8ca94e2cebcefd64","64b3e9ebb2043c92cd20452fcc05501d251b3fa9"],"title":"Significance tests to determine the direction of effects in linear regression models.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12037"}
