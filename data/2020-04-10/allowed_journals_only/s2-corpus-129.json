A probability mass function expresses prior information on interindividual variations of intraindividual parameters. Then, the model progressively integrates new readings to more accurately quantify the characteristics of the individual. This Bayesian framework generalizes the two main approaches currently used in forensic toxicology for the detection of abnormal values of a biomarker. The specificity is independent of the number n of previous test results, with a model that gradually evolves from population-derived limits when n = 0 to individual-based cutoff thresholds when n is large. We applied this model to detect abnormal values in an athlete's steroid profile characterized by the testosterone over epitestosterone (T/E) marker. A cross-validation procedure was used for the estimation of prior densities as well as model validation. The heightened sensitivity/specificity relation obtained on a large data set shows that longitudinal monitoring of an athlete's steroid profile may be used efficiently to detect the abuse of testosterone and its precursors in sports. Mild assumptions make the model interesting for other areas of forensic toxicology.","inCitations":["b574660d6ed1880b4772131de97f5619a6a8dfb1","b1104667ce7d75af2b4793d839d07dc3b1cf51d1","d0700b038fecb741e1b1a5bfa1937527053c6574","4c32623d7a331f9bb47f630581b712c290c14903","77d946dcb57cccb4c40dca46027db1a4f56835a6","3c22f54c9f40ac8e12c9b3b64d92eb5023d16ed7","bcbc812c41ef705c41e282f2139803a64e307cc0","dc13ee538c7d830dffabcc2689394af1904ef0e8","77590b2876efba864f767976a83dba7826ff44f2","6601515cec9a903462e58015d9fb97d00c3f0b94","8e9a1dcd5e8f2ccf0a183529161ffa06f9ebeb85","d10c6d83179d54c3b3063af064082b5c97b5e056","a544cf857aea5874e62fee5073c2b27105c6ec15","972ceaa58618706efe33e3ea5f8f0e9a7d844028","661f2911e5f25ce5df1f282857d8b881667afe6f","ad6bfb92c99fc5fed67fb7a755a84bd07333c785","a57fd4f4ded1a55f0a7411a2f24f91cbf5eac09c","8cd37d64875068a016af814cb3bc19f637f9f7cb","4b4e6b2003439944202aa43f928f2138ad7d6713","ce758258c00138a151b8500877cedd0807ccd36c","e001765249aea0037acb7271143689b3c3052439","83deccc36f55bccdf48426018aeb391f4dc68a3e","74748a12bfcf4a5e15e129f5c6c85890117984eb","ca48243c373659820b05b9e1b68116c556de5ff0","161473be97eb5edf30e64e758a38c039ae8db8f3","5538d76aaad61ac06513bf64956982d50ee8e933","69f83c8598d89e4e3edf8ba26dbba5c98dc35f7a","d27c56d5f4d553d1a877a3a235330ad0f19e78c8","ab6df72a20aa3b41799f3b6a628393ec346b324f","7989c5ab6581dac43403e1788a696b87ac2bb345","4b1d380a7a9fc549151e14cb8483f98a0322bdbf","4f7727efd4b82b736dc39d3aa17a8e3cd7654687","e5bb338113e7c018a9cd7286e326c4038d121312","c1a8d2079ccdb6971d0f5a28fdc62d9e392c5ff7","a9a4640d9fa6c2d10869b4713593943ff60632e4","8b3f65ac2332b67d9eb2488fba144997c2f6e7d3","bb06662b2b9ef6db6ad6f65d9493407e0313b47e","c644d31324f07c84619f2291d01e8e670cc0e5ff","f0acbd395b47b33befabb012f1de8967bdbda86b","05414d5c9c4a9656a0844808ad7ca3435965e745","40c50309a7be3f9b60db4624faeb65f7b759734a","9262915f3afb3dc67827c2eb12075facab0473fb","ffee23e36fd285b10843829148143462807f8d63","256fbb7ac58a8bc76def535564a2d92e73ab3597","d142f3b508cd5a79d288a276dc58cddc20c987e2","40f90923345d83af441a79783e9c794a246be9b9","67b89a1c3302ed07de16346d15e00f1a8d02deb9","73f9f4c7d21441b690bf9cf9e0a6576e7e2f44dc","e31541055ec13ba4c6b1399587683d3677c118db","8e89592d1002b22f517e1248f46e2a00285dfee6","941c637b5807a2cfa83635e84051061f372fc4e7","4e9364cca625db0a0a54cf3f481a6525ed5e1d2b","fe3c4ee3b34645aaca7ed08bf28d393d3af6859c","ec6573774df0d5b722a371d55bb28948bbbb3965","04ab65e25c803aff3045999602f5e38c1fd3099d","0efcc01c1cb7c439fc7008da8d07695a71ba454a","fc58fb2fa47547098520a556c24af18c66bf5cbc","d7eb6cb24ccf0d779c9874ea1bd525f76edcc5a9","151ade6c0a09bcb7aa1c5b8bc4823dfd7835e860","5e8d3cee2fe907d50f3700c99da090fb9417909c","559ffdbdeabe22b5d6dce2595bb534a2a74b5112","f13aa00c0dd049ead97831f62be06617827c2aec","4659c323ca341a054b9c247b10457ca9c4caa90e","36a98eff379c26d043ba283ef98b74e1858817d7"],"title":"Bayesian detection of abnormal values in longitudinal biomarkers with an application to T/E ratio.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl009"}

Imputations are generated from more than one imputation model in order to incorporate uncertainty regarding the missing data mechanism. Parameter estimates based on the different imputation models are combined using rules for nested multiple imputation. Through the use of simulation, we investigate the impact of missing data mechanism uncertainty on post-imputation inferences and show that incorporating this uncertainty can increase the coverage of parameter estimates. We apply our method to a longitudinal clinical trial of low-income women with depression where nonignorably missing data were a concern. We show that different assumptions regarding the missing data mechanism can have a substantial impact on inferences. Our method provides a simple approach for formalizing subjective notions regarding nonresponse so that they can be easily stated, communicated, and compared.","inCitations":["5788c8d3d5c3727f3ff9b47721557dd5ba8a5d81","ffac056ad77c4292f5b167465066e82894f804df","d2ef32a1cfb4a8bd842f8f4fa2171cd94884cb42","de8740f6341b78f562c500a67afcfa3468b37dfa","282fb23d5bb7ba9000ab9a3ba4a70072daa67846","ff9f9f38be8be98f24d0978d37d239f58bf35dfa","0be3d86505678371764c873434d69c46185e90ed","dd752a16049c2317b29ebe8008c94d8c7c525f11","70712381e1f997006166b48e081abd403861ec33","37ed9f23ed152b367ae0afa8afbb8e013575c039","7a4f1c2533de9bfa665af8390acc551a352c7766","d65aab84627c315b9aa8c89218657af010026f7e","278128fbb2954b0c200c1cf8d07bfaf5b44230de","ca463c8c8e44c79c0dda1aae73f0e20374752eac","4903b1742c7d7141f67cc5ae6dc10e73c198c7d8","30d460c71fbb2ac90b43ef881545f85422170e68","ae77a236e7553973e55c405d36274a00e8bf253f","dec96588cdf7cc8276b43511235e61b277d2cdc8","dda825da67a93f3a601dff3bf0eee199a20f5807","66d64209c0a987739438a03dde1deaa41233c87d","cd1a126ece3955e6921b6706a9e9f35de9ff0725","ac86d32eddf20485815b62f13971e963e829b571","cab786abc8938363ebd1bba3e0a43ae0fdc47601","e7d42e2a7738041752e9d267d10f2d2fa61eb916"],"title":"Addressing Missing Data Mechanism Uncertainty using Multiple-Model Multiple Imputation: Application to a Longitudinal Clinical Trial.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS555"}

However, when expert beliefs are to be used to form the prior, the literature is sparse on how feasible and how reliable it is to elicit beliefs from experts. For late-stage clinical trials, high importance is placed on reliability; however, feasibility may be equally important in early-stage trials. This article describes a case study to assess how feasible it is to conduct an elicitation session in a structured manner and to form a probability distribution that would be used in a hypothetical early-stage trial. The case study revealed that by using a structured approach to planning, training and conduct, it is feasible to elicit expert beliefs and form a probability distribution in a timely manner. We argue that by further increasing the published accounts of elicitation of expert beliefs in drug development, there will be increased confidence in the feasibility of conducting elicitation sessions. Furthermore, this will lead to wider dissemination of the pertinent issues on how to quantify uncertainty to both practicing statisticians and others involved with designing trials in a Bayesian manner.","inCitations":["fddfc7dcc90c9951b1ae952246dc3b4f2f3257e1","38eba762cdaf5d6dae2fee2063bf776d5facec5b","68d633c75e414146d8e61399c2c81ae98a2b75ec","25b741da8bbe14ebf6126e4feb872e78f94ea976","048d8a7774f11da738bd893692d51653f700ee6e","a898acc2de378fb47650c7793361c919f1765c6b","b41e8e66d5abb2a03ff4b0b2eb8113c09dec20e6","87fb39e9275060805b8bf88dd19736c51007fbc9","c354fb668139dcb6731618d01ceb2128d3edfd3e","75e2b6ad8c3ad854b5fbf1dcb2371a50199da228","3b9f6bb7b47e5d8be8d62ee165dee7c41da68ae6","170579e33b1fec8329f10933da07efae0e552116"],"title":"Structured approach to the elicitation of expert beliefs for a Bayesian-designed clinical trial: a case study.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1552"}

The addendum focuses on two topics particularly relevant for randomized confirmatory clinical trials: estimands and sensitivity analyses. The need to amend ICH E9 grew out of the realization of a lack of alignment between the objectives of a clinical trial stated in the protocol and the accompanying quantification of the \"treatment effect\" reported in a regulatory submission. We embed time-to-event endpoints in the estimand framework and discuss how the four estimand attributes described in the addendum apply to time-to-event endpoints. We point out that if the proportional hazards assumption is not met, the estimand targeted by the most prevalent methods used to analyze time-to-event endpoints, logrank test, and Cox regression depends on the censoring distribution. We discuss for a large randomized clinical trial how the analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints as well as the sensitivity analyses actually performed in the trial can be seen in the context of the addendum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to do so for a trial with a time-to-event endpoint. Questions that remain open with the addendum for time-to-event endpoints and beyond are formulated, and recommendations for planning of future trials are given. We hope that this will provide a contribution to developing a common framework based on the final version of the addendum that can be applied to design, protocols, statistical analysis plans, and clinical study reports in the future.","inCitations":["88a161c210a10c9cbf2fe998bc4c93df674aae67"],"title":"Treatment effect quantification for time-to-event endpoints-Estimands, analysis strategies, and beyond.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1917"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2002,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"We present two tests for seasonal trend in monthly incidence data. The first approach uses a penalized likelihood to choose the number of harmonic terms to include in a parametric harmonic model (which includes time trends and autogression as well as seasonal harmonic terms) and then tests for seasonality using a parametric bootstrap test. The second approach uses a semiparametric regression model to test for seasonal trend. In the semiparametric model, the seasonal pattern is modeled nonparametrically, parametric terms are included for autoregressive effects and a linear time trend, and a parametric bootstrap test is used to test for seasonality. For both procedures, a null distribution is generated under a null Poisson model with time trends and autoregression parameters. We apply the methods to skin melanoma incidence rates collected by the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, and perform simulation studies to evaluate the type I error rate and power for the two procedures. These simulations suggest that both procedures are alpha-level procedures. In addition, the harmonic model/bootstrap test had similar or larger power than the semiparametric model/bootstrap test for a wide range of alternatives, and the harmonic model/bootstrap test is much easier to implement. Thus, we recommend the harmonic model/bootstrap test for the analysis of seasonal incidence data.","inCitations":["c2a1cf8eeabaf089192c70281546f7d8e1e63029","21348b5f9c75a88114519f66f4dfd1dc47fc13bd","42b4b100e5a4aa43f005e2d24ea5690d10cce4cf","720f094d283e04523e0531bd9124c4e0d0921984","67c7ca0d9633a0687cd988f12527c1042bef1020","e0d43b5dc164387d3bf17c563359c30bfc20aeb0","f0b572f7a5ed4df9fb3733113ac37f8511b84189","4de44e52c762601a5cb34a6baa65ec6e38be3e6e","824fe817f5b8ae8353cb966e424d518e22481cc3","5e9d44e61a6972a26875b1493daec35a23b4a02e","f705b8778d013af56124d6ab823d25cea5a1d16b","edd15c66924b7556e98982431c375cdb5cafaadf","9578437bc53f9c625668593a20f34d1864f6330c","82d7668753e92a78ae9f27d3a519f6c1fc880fa6","57df01f300af0562bd7b848c2503b94f79492e09","205ca496e11bf979891885dc62126976308230c3","626c5961d97bd9e273ef55bedc16fffbad8edb2a","6620dfcf53d0cba8f3370d0c4133c43ea2eddd96","8790adf4857c43c37e0b2c3d4466cc1a9385b6d4","2e7465cfedf41296ae70e4ed1b1596002f953448","80299852f19ae51af02588f4d16f3df0a3b05a6d","ed1871819a0f3fd75959d3e78389213f596b4092","fc9363bddadbca239228fa880db1a777900bf34e"],"title":"Parametric and semiparametric approaches to testing for seasonal trend in serial count data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.2.289"}

With the help of repeated measurements and a large number of sampled subjects, our method does not require any distributional assumption on (x, y, z) or any model assumption on the conditional mean (or variance) of x - y. Furthermore, our test is designed so that when the null hypothesis is rejected, we can conclude that the two assay methods do not have practically meaningful difference with a high statistical assurance, which is an approach adopted in the assessment of bioequivalence between two drug products.","inCitations":["00a4684e15aca717992c5f665afa52b07533cd63","1e447c7c6f2553154267e2996983e491623eb17a","313dd66aad0d3b6bd433729d84eab03ea031ea50","ce1c54c0d7e82cade0662f48509815ce3146c03f","9f21f898e4148403aa2cf739e07d51c79fabf6c7"],"title":"Assessing the agreement between two quantitative assays with repeated measurements.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120028515"}

Hence the number of screens for a given individual is a random variable as well. We use the actuarial life table from the Social Security Administration to obtain the lifetime distribution, and then use this information to project the lead time distribution for someone with a future screening schedule. Simulation studies using the HIP study group data provide estimates of the lead time under different screening frequencies. The projected lead time has two components: a point mass at zero (corresponding to interval cases detected between screening exams) and a continuous probability density. We present estimates of the projected lead time for participants in a breast cancer screening program. The model is more realistic and can inform optimal screening frequency. This study focuses on breast cancer screening, but is applicable to other kinds of cancer screening also.","inCitations":["80cddfb96dab60ed5c9850d04e7ff6931412aa4d","32d41c0b686743a5c2c718f846cc43a412406833","560ee81102ab021c5790fe4e15b379077a73048e","099b69dcbc2bd8fa23359189307d8bed50ad83fa","7a202f26cfbe3dedb9d6a3f6560bea160b9f3db0","b383cdd5424f041782a3a979e378b4726551cc79","36967863c12a62cfc506cf8492c844221bbc0857","41fb7904e51746d1f32e30a60afc1e9979e3fe83","18987c5fa6727495af937ea11cd1e020408d4b8f"],"title":"The Lead Time Distribution When Lifetime is Subject to Competing Risks in Cancer Screening","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1363"}

Many two-phase case-control studies involve biased sampling of cases and/or controls in the second phase. For example, controls are often frequency-matched to cases with respect to other covariates. Ignoring biased sampling of cases and/or controls can lead to biased inference regarding biomarkers' classification accuracy. Considering the problems of estimating and comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for a binary disease outcome, the impact of biased sampling of cases and/or controls on inference and the strategy to efficiently account for the sampling scheme have not been well studied. In this project, we investigate the inverse-probability-weighted method to adjust for biased sampling in estimating and comparing AUC. Asymptotic properties of the estimator and its inference procedure are developed for both Bernoulli sampling and finite-population stratified sampling. In simulation studies, the weighted estimators provide valid inference for estimation and hypothesis testing, while the standard empirical estimators can generate invalid inference. We demonstrate the use of the analytical variance formula for optimizing sampling schemes in biomarker study design and the application of the proposed AUC estimators to examples in HIV vaccine research and prostate cancer research.","inCitations":["17ea8a0dde9a8559b2a28a1ed13a37750de4828b"],"title":"Evaluating and comparing biomarkers with respect to the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve in two-phase case–control studies","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw003"}

When the endpoint of interest is time to event outcome such as time to cancer recurrence, a biomarker's time-varying discriminatory performance is often assessed by time-dependent ROC analysis. In practice, biomarkers are often imprecisely measured due to the limitation of assay sensitivity. The values below the limit of detection are not detectable. Ignorance of such data characteristic may lead to inaccurate estimation of marker's potential discriminatory power. The objective of this article is to extend time-dependent ROC method to censored biomarker data by using parameter estimates from the Cox regression model that accommodates censored biomarker measurements. In the simulation study, the proposed methods are shown to outperform the simple substitution method that has been conventionally adopted for handling censored data.

It has been commonly used in many practical problems. Despite its success, since the loss function of the PLR is unbounded, resulting classifiers can be sensitive to outliers. To build more robust classifiers, we propose the robust PLR (RPLR) which uses truncated logistic loss functions, and suggest three schemes to estimate conditional class probabilities. Connections of the RPLR with some other existing work on robust logistic regression have been discussed. Our theoretical results indicate that the RPLR is Fisher consistent and more robust to outliers. Moreover, we develop estimated generalized approximate cross validation (EGACV) for the tuning parameter selection. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate that truncating the loss function indeed yields better performance in terms of classification accuracy and class probability estimation.","inCitations":["225ae44d93ee73a762d52709b6e9ca176a4ca9c8","26a5ac1a2c8c2e8bdfb3e62b4e0f5287f89016d6","a72e98969f4779459dd3b7f4356de3dd49996003","738fa1f243734309d2544dcec17abdaac11a4881","a52632e5f287e71bade13fe85536c3b7461764e9","eaebd691e7c4c259bd4ed1a0ab9fd44396e44efb","ce2895e5527db1e63e1d3d85f94d31949965583d","b91224fdf1c16d094d76ef5aa3a69811d5db423b","d7b92300e43e29f5977ad3ae15b6b9075e25ab11","cc6a55ff2ef1f3c389337e27b571f55d2b91558f","9b73daf547ecf9c612d8efaf6022b0a6637f33ca","12dba59c0bd783c4b9c84d2c933f5b3acc9867c7"],"title":"Robust penalized logistic regression with truncated loss functions.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.10105"}

Gene discovery using microarray data requires adjustment for the large-scale multiplicity of candidate genes. The family-wise error rate (FWER) has been widely chosen as a global type I error rate adjusting for the multiplicity. Typically in microarray data, the expression levels of different genes are correlated because of coexpressing genes and the common experimental conditions shared by the genes on each array. To accurately control the FWER, the statistical testing procedure should appropriately reflect the dependency among the genes. Permutation methods have been used for accurate control of the FWER in analyzing microarray data. It is important to calculate the required sample size at the design stage of a new (confirmatory) microarray study. Because of the high dimensionality and complexity of the correlation structure in microarray data, however, there have been no sample size calculation methods accurately reflecting the true correlation structure of real microarray data. We propose sample size and power calculation methods that are useful when pilot data are available to design a confirmatory experiment. If no pilot data are available, we recommend a two-stage sample size recalculation based on our proposed method using the first stage data as pilot data. The calculated sample sizes are shown to accurately maintain the power through simulations. A real data example is taken to illustrate the proposed method.","inCitations":["d35655039e679df1961451e9638df468c32c861b","47eb8ee48720e23c403be9c0d94eaad3f9deaf46","ae70a2ad7c9794e9c9188039c1dcea96df5ce64a","b3e7cbb603d112249bfef710e4012012f9b55a6a","06b916219dc2248d5d2b4e6bd9bebcea24e656d3","f62dd2ddf07463a366da176bf7294923140b7b5b","a54a133562ca25a8955711f9292c2eedbeefb6c6","56d17f14f1eb41c7be3c5e1a964c3a6ef4a31c63"],"title":"Power and sample size calculation for microarray studies.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.500066"}

To study humoral response in pancreatic cancers, Patwa et al. (2007) developed a two-dimensional liquid separation technique and built a two-dimensional antibody microarray. However, identifying differential expression regions on the antibody microarray requires the use of appropriate statistical methods to fairly assess the large amounts of data generated. In this paper, we propose a permutation-based test using spatial information of the two-dimensional antibody microarray. By borrowing strength from the neighboring differentially expressed spots, we are able to detect the differential expression region with very high power controlling type I error at 0.05 in our simulation studies. We also apply the proposed methodology to a real microarray dataset.","inCitations":["41874574794296b3e3be5a572a4a53f66d4b32f4","64257112ea5f24f4d83b184b687571d2acc4673b"],"title":"Identification of differentially expressed spatial clusters using humoral response microarray data","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.04.026"}

For example, the analysis of data obtained using perfusion computed tomography to characterize functional imaging biomarkers in cancerous regions of the liver can benefit from partially informative data collected concurrently in non-cancerous regions. This paper presents a hierarchical model structure that leverages all available information about a curve, using penalized splines, while accommodating important between-source features. Our proposed methods flexibly borrow strength from the supplemental data to a degree that reflects the commensurability of the supplemental curve with the primary curve. We investigate our method's properties for nonparametric regression via simulation, and apply it to a set of liver cancer data. We also apply our method for a semiparametric hazard model to data from a clinical trial that compares time to disease progression for three colorectal cancer treatments, while supplementing inference with information from a previous trial that tested the current standard of care.","inCitations":["2fa7be1a8cc76e291b50862a9470b4bbb503200d","83adcf1a43500fcf70fd58c9f345846acd137ba6","285b397f823c327aff64247fadfb3661c32dea49","9ece90edcaaeb29e3674abd5c87e3cd08eae96e5","b4650bc55041cd7c022932f5f52b916bb8b4bbe0"],"title":"Combining Nonexchangeable Functional or Survival Data Sources in Oncology Using Generalized Mixture Commensurate Priors.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS840"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2019,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Subgroup by treatment interaction assessments are routinely performed when analysing clinical trials and are particularly important for phase 3 trials where the results may affect regulatory labelling. Interpretation of such interactions is particularly difficult, as on one hand the subgroup finding can be due to chance, but equally such analyses are known to have a low chance of detecting differential treatment effects across subgroup levels, so may overlook important differences in therapeutic efficacy. EMA have therefore issued draft guidance on the use of subgroup analyses in this setting. Although this guidance provided clear proposals on the importance of pre-specification of likely subgroup effects and how to use this when interpreting trial results, it is less clear which analysis methods would be reasonable, and how to interpret apparent subgroup effects in terms of whether further evaluation or action is necessary. A PSI/EFSPI Working Group has therefore been investigating a focused set of analysis approaches to assess treatment effect heterogeneity across subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials that take account of the number of subgroups explored and also investigating the ability of each method to detect such subgroup heterogeneity. This evaluation has shown that the plotting of standardised effects, bias-adjusted bootstrapping method and SIDES method all perform more favourably than traditional approaches such as investigating all subgroup-by-treatment interactions individually or applying a global test of interaction. Therefore, these approaches should be considered to aid interpretation and provide context for observed results from subgroup analyses conducted for phase 3 clinical trials.","inCitations":["778d4471b3b02c83cb7fd87b17f771dd90ee1847"],"title":"Subgroup analysis and interpretation for phase 3 confirmatory trials: White paper of the EFSPI/PSI working group on subgroup analysis.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1919"}
