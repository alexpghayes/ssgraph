(2004, 2007) and Tadigotla et al. (2006), formulated thermodynamic explanations of sequence-dependent transcription pausing by RNA polymerase (RNAP). The two models differ in some basic assumptions and therefore make different yet overlapping predictions for pause locations, and different predictions on pause kinetics and mechanisms. Here we present a comprehensive comparison of the two models. We show that while they have comparable predictive power of pause locations at low NTP concentrations, the Bai et al. model is more accurate than Tadigotla et al. at higher NTP concentrations. Pausing kinetics predicted by Bai et al. is also consistent with time-course transcription reactions, while Tadigotla et al. is unsuited for this type of kinetic prediction. More importantly, the two models in general predict different pausing mechanisms even for the same pausing sites, and the Bai et al. model provides an explanation more consistent with recent single molecule observations.","inCitations":["31d6fc70c6a74204c73451a791c1c27aa9e2de71","b8075f4893125213d92ae3ceb654de95aafb3ad5","0c07f5b53140dbd3115d9e2bf1c9710594098301","b560e6e22e498e8815b5e189ce827ddf71d65133","d9a0e4d13aca85c23f739b9d6eae64230e24651b","2d21adc79554584fba771c1a3b4114da5a24b641"],"title":"Comparison of Pause Predictions of Two Sequence-Dependent Transcription Models.","doi":"10.1088/1742-5468/2010/12/P12007"}

For example, let Y(1) and Y(2) be two non-negative random variables denoting the health expenditures for cases and controls. Smooth Quantile Ratio Estimation (SQUARE) is a novel approach for estimating Delta=E[Y(1)] - E[Y(2)] by smoothing across percentiles the log-transformed ratio of the two quantile functions. Dominici et al. (2005) have shown that SQUARE defines a large class of estimators of Delta, is more efficient than common parametric and nonparametric estimators of Delta, and is consistent and asymptotically normal. However, in applications it is often desirable to estimate Delta(x)=E[Y(1)|x]--E[Y(2)|x], that is, the difference in means as a function of x. In this paper we extend SQUARE to a regression model and we introduce a two-part regression SQUARE for estimating Delta(x) as a function of x. We use the first part of the model to estimate the probability of incurring any costs and the second part of the model to estimate the mean difference in health expenditures, given that a nonzero cost is observed. In the second part of the model, we apply the basic definition of SQUARE for positive costs to compare expenditures for the cases and controls having 'similar' covariate profiles. We determine strata of cases and control with 'similar' covariate profiles by the use of propensity score matching. We then apply two-part regression SQUARE to the 1987 National Medicare Expenditure Survey to estimate the difference Delta(x) between persons suffering from smoking-attributable diseases and persons without these diseases as a function of the propensity of getting the disease. Using a simulation study, we compare frequentist properties of two-part regression SQUARE with maximum likelihood estimators for the log-transformed expenditures.","inCitations":["ec0da76afa44fa0dcd22508f07a64e35322d1c12","40bf363fc316d63390c69515b10ff63ec40db12e","46b1c7a454735e86122eca0c9d440ef684d52768","84f002565cbbd936b4f2be9dac43ae23f6c96c30","6809d4c59b73e3bb9e1592f39311498c2cb7d9ea","965ff2cf8e526746966c02df34e264b78116bd79","e970a941bc89fc95213289a397bd45efc6bc15a9","7ad930f06ee4c9b74e3a2dc82f67b093769e3e02","0e929390b28fd35527040626215439ac71822147","ff4484e8b28d7f5079a40732efedf9ffddbe75bb","bfa792c79ca301f4524c8424cc2ffd811d8effeb","a0b304c4098828440e22927f783e09ba3d095dfb","678f22263b01430ec546ccf316cd23240bd34cc7"],"title":"Smooth quantile ratio estimation with regression: estimating medical expenditures for smoking-attributable diseases.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi031"}

However, for time-to-event variables such as progression-free survival (PFS), the effect of the measurement variability in the underlying measurements defining the event is less well understood. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the impact of measurement variability in tumor assessment on the treatment effect hazard ratio for PFS and on the median PFS time, for different tumor assessment frequencies. Our results show that scan measurement variability can cause attenuation of the treatment effect (i.e. the hazard ratio is closer to one) and that the extent of attenuation may be increased with more frequent scan assessments. This attenuation leads to inflation of the type II error. Therefore, scan measurement variability should be minimized as far as possible in order to reveal a treatment effect that is closest to the truth. In disease settings where the measurement variability is shown to be large, consideration may be given to inflating the sample size of the study to maintain statistical power.","inCitations":["2a08b1be99008c98e289a23ec7199c24fee13859","caf2d88f6b10e5f8127f885dd2af3e129bfe4082","d34cf7aadbfd1b0dc4e5f22d36632ddea1ebf18f","9b64e5348e0e0732cebba88e8435a8b2465f45f9"],"title":"Attenuation of treatment effect due to measurement variability in assessment of progression-free survival.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1524"}

Causal interpretations of these effects typically rely on sequential ignorability. Because this assumption is not empirically testable, it is important to conduct sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity analyses so far offered for this situation have either focused on the case where the outcome follows a linear model or involve nonparametric or semiparametric models. We propose alternative approaches that are suitable for responses following generalized linear models. The first approach uses a Gaussian copula model involving latent versions of the mediator and the final outcome. The second approach uses a so-called hybrid causal-observational model that extends the association model for the final outcome, providing a novel sensitivity parameter. These models, while still assuming a randomized exposure, allow for unobserved (as well as observed) mediator-outcome confounders that are not affected by exposure. The methods are applied to data from a study of the effect of mother education on dental caries in adolescence.","inCitations":["f04831c3732a41a3e284920c2f81fca294871d69","1c34d9fead7440821e67f4ca499b4e9e02008ac7","f3473935cd394234e338ea07c58078fa3cdddd3c","934d40454a2f54d87135eca5280b3781b7300263","6be82541670c8d115a1b6c765754c8e4aa631109","99b732c8d1094dd5f8484e0ec8081169fa86be7c","535b5b45ac643bf5b7a7d2ae50b613627abca6fd"],"title":"Sensitivity analyses for parametric causal mediation effect estimation.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu048"}

Ignoring incompleteness or handling the data inappropriately may bias study results, reduce power and efficiency, and alter important risk/benefit relationships. Standard ways of dealing with missing values, such as complete case analysis (CCA), are generally inappropriate due to the loss of precision and risk of bias. Multiple imputation by fully conditional specification (FCS MI) is a powerful and statistically valid method for creating imputations in large data sets which include both categorical and continuous variables. It specifies the multivariate imputation model on a variable-by-variable basis and offers a principled yet flexible method of addressing missing data, which is particularly useful for large data sets with complex data structures. However, FCS MI is still rarely used in epidemiology, and few practical resources exist to guide researchers in the implementation of this technique.

However, the analysis of qMRI has been limited to ad-hoc heuristic methods. Our research provides a powerful statistical framework for image analysis and sheds light on future localized adaptive treatment regimes tailored to the individual's response. We assume in an imperfect world we only observe a blurred and noisy version of the underlying pathological/physiological changes via qMRI, due to measurement errors or unpredictable influences. We use a hidden Markov Random Field to model the spatial dependence in the data and develop a maximum likelihood approach via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm with stochastic variation. An important improvement over previous work is the assessment of variability in parameter estimation, which is the valid basis for statistical inference. More importantly, we focus on the expected changes rather than image segmentation. Our research has shown that the approach is powerful in both simulation studies and on a real dataset, while quite robust in the presence of some model assumption violations.","inCitations":["d165800d1917442d74010fe340050ee28f2c633c","9cbb6474108e88ce7931dfb528410e61bac18428","9b9d220d1d0bf73ce81c10a6fe474699eb5b8cde","cb8878aa5136531b8aefba81141780af21201a88","463645068f016a4b29e2aa6d892abf8d64a38815","f48f02daab107deb5795bf7a5b3df2e347784752","682c07a5dc92cf3f6ee2e771985e1a265d0070b7","ff88493656d798ab078bce4b50a0e9d4a0f7a478"],"title":"Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Image Analysis via the Em Algorithm with Stochastic Variation.","doi":"10.1214/07-AOAS157"}

However, often the intermediate and terminal events are censored in different ways, leading to a dual censoring scheme. In such settings, unbiased estimation of the cumulative transition intensity functions cannot be achieved without some degree of smoothing. To overcome this problem, we develop a sieve maximum likelihood approach for inference on the hazard ratio. A simulation study shows that the sieve estimator offers improved finite-sample performance over common imputation-based alternatives and is robust to some forms of dependent censoring. The proposed method is illustrated using data from cancer trials.","inCitations":["1fd4ad0240ace5cf0ba3d1c87fba2223608aaa26","f513a0d459bbe3633cac5a4fcb0081eebe9bbbd7"],"title":"Sieve estimation in a Markov illness-death process under dual censoring.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv042"}

Families are typically accrued through a biased sampling scheme in which affected individuals are identified and sampled along with their relatives who may provide right-censored or current status data on their disease onset times. We develop likelihood and composite likelihood methods for modeling the within-family association in these times through copula models in which dependencies are characterized by Kendall's [Formula: see text] Auxiliary data from independent individuals are exploited by augmentating composite likelihoods to increase precision of marginal parameter estimates and consequently increase efficiency in dependence parameter estimation. An application to a motivating family study in psoriatic arthritis illustrates the method and provides some evidence of excessive paternal transmission of risk.","inCitations":["74daf3f7f0ad8833013e471e8b323b1500f4ec19"],"title":"Augmented composite likelihood for copula modeling in family studies under biased sampling.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv054"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"year":2016,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"Motivated by a study on visual implicit learning in young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), we propose a robust functional clustering (RFC) algorithm to identify subgroups within electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed RFC is an iterative algorithm based on functional principal component analysis, where cluster membership is updated via predictions of the functional trajectories obtained through a non-parametric random effects model. We consider functional data resulting from event-related potential (ERP) waveforms representing EEG time-locked to stimuli over the course of an implicit learning experiment, after applying a previously proposed meta-preprocessing step. This meta-preprocessing is designed to increase the low signal-to-noise ratio in the raw data and to mitigate the longitudinal changes in the ERP waveforms which characterize the nature and speed of learning. The resulting functional ERP components (peak amplitudes and latencies) inherently exhibit covariance heterogeneity due to low data quality over some stimuli inducing the averaging of different numbers of waveforms in sliding windows of the meta-preprocessing step. The proposed RFC algorithm incorporates this known covariance heterogeneity into the clustering algorithm, improving cluster quality, as illustrated in the data application and extensive simulation studies. ASD is a heterogeneous syndrome and identifying subgroups within ASD children is of interest for understanding the diverse nature of this complex disorder. Applications to the implicit learning paradigm identify subgroups within ASD and typically developing children with diverse learning patterns over the course of the experiment, which may inform clinical stratification of ASD.","inCitations":["b18a5ad8ed1b977fcb0e92c505b0dd4c1263ba54","a9ec03ff3110faa220e2c9b436281cc5731eaeca","1d5b3f12c9d58c84d03eb8d4dbe28ba6710441d8","da5c5c63deaa6c5ac784180b67489cca11a582b2"],"title":"Robust functional clustering of ERP data with application to a study of implicit learning in autism.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw002"}

In this article we demonstrate how to construct a TMLE that also satisfies the property that it is at least as efficient as a user supplied asymptotically linear estimator. In particular it is shown that this type of TMLE can incorporate empirical efficiency maximization as in Rubin and van der Laan (2008), Tan (2008, 2010), Rotnitzky et al.

However, in practice, observations are usually collected from heterogeneous populations where such an assumption is not satisfied, leading in turn to nonlinear relationships among variables. To address such situations we explore mixtures of Gaussian graphical models; in particular, we consider both infinite mixtures and infinite hidden Markov models where the emission distributions correspond to Gaussian graphical models. Such models allow us to divide a heterogeneous population into homogenous groups, with each cluster having its own conditional independence structure. As an illustration, we study the trends in foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the pre-Euro era.","inCitations":["db45a1dd2fd72d4b73e88c70f8be73e9246a7679","ba31169f17c9a343d67a7c41e9dd50b0288ec32f","47b12210ed1f479a3aaf79571bb51c0e9a082d54","fe09d7ab64844c0fcbcb32925bd7bac6710a76a2","12b9bebd7fc2e8e3b0aeac886760f80f34b4fee8","eafc3b3296997136b3f701a7b135a52fb1a6f397","944b71dbc3df67f570bd103a437b54ee91fc4e82","7d78241bcc3bc3bd952e89e3157058997c1f8067","fbec348885435a57bebc7f46cecae6722a16f85e","391df01cf94ec914c2bf055f802ef9a9526f3be3","28d4687a14165188df49146058ff56c60cc8ac8e","01c9b856c26faa0b962f02adb1475f425f96ca9a","5d827e4c02884e737bbc2f6720df57dbeb4f92cd","99510c346e74586a7840b2b42e5ddd7f2041a75e","0515b0fefd2565b19b5c233488baa8c184539d82","f7ef3f8458f37d5d1cc15aa128da17e66f26be5b","887f54bd174e2891c3e58cd131f459da87a703d6","8f906940c5e08d61f6c1f628592621f7df171a00","40fa7a3fb9c59d389047d8db746f22bece535bbd","541abd0d0b6c6343c2432a5656081400725b8ebf","ea8280de8663bf64a7a50fef8d6fbc235036c7a1","54549500aebc73dcb1322d9d0222395663aa327e","d0220dc7fae13b63324cf1353e0b662dca166407","5a881e585441a1098c4307d3ac1d8d237313f18e","2d48c9647e315c77de0e95a5a34ba788bf9500d2","fe40c74cc7ad774e32fff19f34f67db13afd199f"],"title":"Sparse covariance estimation in heterogeneous samples.","doi":"10.1214/11-EJS634"}

In the absence of censoring, the new estimate coincides with the usual partial likelihood estimate, both estimates being consistent for a parameter having an interpretation as an average population regression effect. In the presence of an independent censorship, the new estimate is still consistent for this same population parameter, whereas the partial likelihood estimate will converge to a different quantity that depends on censoring. We give an approximation of the population average effect as integral beta(t)dF(t). The new estimate is easy to compute, requiring only minor modifications to existing softwares. We illustrate the use of the average effect estimate on a breast cancer dataset from Institut Curie. The behavior of the estimator, its comparison with the partial likelihood estimate, as well as the approximation by integral beta(t)dF(t)are studied via simulation.","inCitations":["238d58e733afad876b3a11bf170f26277e3701cc","341ca1161457ca4a5854c2725a731a4ed825ce8e","126f1eb76fa383e0d547fad276cce06fb91ee152","33d54317a21891f8879a3178fbe9ac388ee38af1","7ba40b17e4d1fe313b983f69e8a3e1139681fe9c","039e335b214b827eaf54e4636b3ee7cb6e04391b","b351b0c1fcb753a2a8b42546f1974a8433dfe57c","0dfa635a17e57b91e211e43b644ff4c5185443ec","7f7e2020d6bd1f3c0ad08fcb02dd7dff298da261","2fe24a87a662ba2da77d8abb1185d87f8ffb60b8","3d2b74274049d3b258acacf60b2d63315e33a884","d62a392a2c8fd82bc1f0be5b75be455c8cf44fe0","e677766e5a34f4fe49008866530fc4214536ad2e","dc05f6856281fc0f332599a577ab6858893eb146","85496e56bebf9f9254e96d3ec03f8a672243244c","b3f094957fe2a80c6631a2ff8ec69f666065c8ab","b12825a405573adee1cff9300fac71c733f1a9db","d0b1e0704bb0858434619f12abfca4b09aca289c","c7575322a410319526d10c2979254843863958aa","8195ff0e89859167a41c6c762e9a02b6b9bcadfa","660934ce6e08deeb0dbbaefa115875629df841f3","f1305ba2818509b7a15ef53427ceb111b8815d5f","96bffec91a6b39fd301f6f78bdbc3d926ff025d1","dc9f49238e2f91c65ae15fd9e6984f188e60ecb5","a6c8c96e1ec3b9428874ca37d9ecc45bd3be56a2","1da33bcf8fbb6db490f468122aa02d72d8567b48","1feef43a8852c1ead545cc4cf580f4b35b9881ec","92dd2b2f3516d275f81d3375d3e639b7bd2880a4","62612d51af31320672fc7999646acf3adae6805d","7117813374703796cc7f01e3c94d74ac475aaa25","9527ab3f73b8b75fee7630c7a150ffac069fb1d2","2d5c693924f18e34961f5da8f83f13f7aa2b52ca","80b2c6ce72060f2b0f5c3b02987e9d5606e9fbf1","73ba4f9875116815ee14a68421e852809d7ae2db","c70391172cc78924517ef2f7205fb4f3857c82d2","d246bba1cb84432f1ff239a2279344be23fbeadd","1f7809ca36f0d65ec6004a38bf0c03a2da4bb67c","10b18a114fa561b571601f822926585f24307a4e","7397827eb25d738bd83dd493e8614ea7bac820ef","990faac19c8981a292db0ac6e8c9755d7fc0cbd6","0a2c436654939515aafccd9d5f24058734405010","b8624934511940edc3ce789da4c5f64ad9213dac","45fb13f82e27f5ebb8f1f8fbdf8025343010c3f1","40bcccb4fd5626fdf5cb7e8baf6ba4d22260c63b","547f451fc9f65d0e38c5816f26e0768677e1ff9b","2c18d592eb170cabf500bb80f6908820d1a3bdba","c4c973c6d7f37c29a17497fd52ed6b0a8645d9f5","7696661f829ec66ef6d468e2e8317a05523a484f","fd10f1dede2ec65a32115ec6ed9bda9fc39287ce","4ea2d42db58f41d66890b33df4314396e4c1feed","fdcb63abbc417105197825c69c01acc0e00987d3","12a5b0993a3f1d2470eaac4e0fd976d0f012d204","c29ccb51e3fe7b3648c41071ac0d6496eb787bd1","3b5cd38aa8d730c4fcaa85b2c861eb4bc28f2c59","5cc11178754036008aef278961a967960bfe38f7","cd7719efebb899b65be618c8c367301f2db11535"],"title":"Estimating average regression effect under non-proportional hazards.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.423"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Public health research often concerns relationships between exposures and correlated count outcomes. When counts exhibit more zeros than expected under Poisson sampling, the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model with random effects may be used. However, the latent class formulation of the ZIP model can make marginal inference on the sampled population challenging. This article presents a marginalized ZIP model with random effects to directly model the mean of the mixture distribution consisting of 'susceptible' individuals and excess zeroes, providing straightforward inference for overall exposure effects. Simulations evaluate finite sample properties, and the new methods are applied to a motivational interviewing-based safer sex intervention trial, designed to reduce the number of unprotected sexual acts.","inCitations":["1af15b10dee8977fe85ccfc6e9d5b935cf4f8d03","7cc08e0ce5eae240b1fb97eb76adbe8ced983d6c","70d4b248171b444e922a34115229de6044e0bfd8","d3bd657f94c91e7a7603d5f60639b40a7c5670d0","ebf2a0389a509e9575c0be48bb1e4af4fef9e3d2","fbbee8268b61d747f8cee00fa5be9a8138db9b58","118f41bd9ab7163c86bd7a1b2291cee1b41eb28e","64aca0e9107aaee8212e0cc0b5c9d671a0f7cdd9","5aca0355d74eedbe08574be078ccd8f402f005e1","276f4efef99896bb2da707410c8f2f5e0f5dc1f4","96b1f9f23bd9c57bcbfbca2ed322a1938f1bedf2","f9454380db0aabae82b4352ada55b952db7af847","3bca0658c79c87f7b4689ca5c1448c2a300ca91c"],"title":"A Marginalized Zero-inflated Poisson Regression Model with Random Effects.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12104"}

Given the multitude of pathways through which the treatment or risk factor may affect the outcome, there is also an interest in decomposing the effect of a treatment of risk factor into \"direct\" and \"mediated\" effects. For example, child's socioeconomic status (risk factor) may have a direct effect on the risk of death (outcome) and an effect that may be mediated through the adulthood socioeconomic status (mediator). Building on the potential outcome framework for causal inference, we develop a Bayesian approach for estimating direct and mediated effects in the context of a dichotomous mediator and dichotomous outcome, which is challenging as many parameters cannot be fully identified. We first define principal strata corresponding to the joint distribution of the observed and counterfactual values of the mediator, and define associate, dissociative, and mediated effects as functions of the differences in the mean outcome under differing treatment assignments within the principal strata. We then develop the likelihood properties and calculate nonparametric bounds of these causal effects assuming randomized treatment assignment. Because likelihood theory is not well developed for nonidentifiable parameters, we consider a Bayesian approach that allows the direct and mediated effects to be expressed in terms of the posterior distribution of the population parameters of interest. This range can be reduced by making further assumptions about the parameters that can be encoded in prior distribution assumptions. We perform sensitivity analyses by using several prior distributions that make weaker assumptions than monotonicity or the exclusion restriction. We consider an application that explores the mediating effects of adult poverty on the relationship between childhood poverty and risk of death.","inCitations":["9367e321906aa2c020f3a99d8bf3cbbaea61b395","d54247f4728e35301be116aa60dd7535c3119db4","122b0517fd7886e44354bee42a0dfc4e95e53aad","4d547cfbb0173f64dbdcfaab2fd8aa383f0d56fa","078d900698a2a86d85bfe088e8d7e2e0373794e1","83d990cf2226519f8188b22bdf3831895b81954b","fa3701a731d9ad242c1f65a201f819abdfc1541d","33585bb8106967332c464cf1eaaf23bdbde7ef55","4e7a2dc1aae19d74d7045624037844f8c5544e69","16c1f36fcbf1abb32664f7c6aae7e6c2651d3ed3","07d60eb20a77ba232c7bd74f3da45452da9ba488","46596b57af63696a1714f8ec515e360708ee9905","139a48f0ac4731e75973c2c973209892c88fe669","e7f687cf50716ab71b48f95076c86faf86c41af4","305c1929f9b5cd60aede21b30b7f6fb65b31dbd3","6be82541670c8d115a1b6c765754c8e4aa631109","65c3af674360aa718bf2135cc0560c380c3a42c2","22824e27581e78c9b5cd446e7cc8ce708f3bd7e1","6417031cbe56ef349cd5a14ea683eaa4f604ade1","cafd2886a4c193eab542a8686c60131f46233c8d","67548529695ba7f337d5c8238d0eb037d1e64222","e89d845dd4075ac9545e0b3d31ac5f850cc0d6b6","ba73bf39a97ff60048a99f7ea38f0ef155e13eb1"],"title":"Bayesian inference for causal mediation effects using principal stratification with dichotomous mediators and outcomes.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp060"}

We develop an approach to relational learning which, given a set of pairs of objects S = {A(1) : B(1), A(2) : B(2), …, A(N) : B(N)}, measures how well other pairs A : B fit in with the set S. Our work addresses the following question: is the relation between objects A and B analogous to those relations found in S? Such questions are particularly relevant in information retrieval, where an investigator might want to search for analogous pairs of objects that match the query set of interest. There are many ways in which objects can be related, making the task of measuring analogies very challenging. Our approach combines a similarity measure on function spaces with Bayesian analysis to produce a ranking. It requires data containing features of the objects of interest and a link matrix specifying which relationships exist; no further attributes of such relationships are necessary. We illustrate the potential of our method on text analysis and information networks. An application on discovering functional interactions between pairs of proteins is discussed in detail, where we show that our approach can work in practice even if a small set of protein pairs is provided.","inCitations":["d4d02c6882861c6d42e670829fe0dd90d3daee8a","2597b5108e603cf551bac255d3309952faa132dc","8662e0feab7ce46fc21bdf1d072ed7342555dc7f","e9e9326095d09fe52b8c4cb4d9954e8a00397baa","5895e78005cffda16ec5d26faed8feb25d7aae72","3a1ceb5285cd24aad012e56b408144c0b36a2cfb"],"title":"Ranking Relations using Analogies in Biological and Information Networks","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS321"}

There is great interest in understanding the relationship among S, T, and Z. A principal stratification (PS) framework has been proposed by Frangakis and Rubin (2002) to study their causal associations. In this paper, we extend the framework to a multiple trial setting and propose a Bayesian hierarchical PS model to assess surrogacy. We apply the method to data from a large collection of colon cancer trials in which S and T are binary. We obtain the trial-specific causal measures among S, T, and Z, as well as their overall population-level counterparts that are invariant across trials. The method allows for information sharing across trials and reduces the nonidentifiability problem. We examine the frequentist properties of our model estimates and the impact of the monotonicity assumption using simulations. We also illustrate the challenges in evaluating surrogacy in the counterfactual framework that result from nonidentifiability.","inCitations":["b340ed5771327eb6c17114f3218da1d64e57669b","3a8cd5bc30d9ea22aabf47c2c137063862528803","3e6fe4ee2444ad5bf2e8bca2da94c905bb1cfe21","b2cf4ef5b4fabc28ca4638fe3a0853e78b59a6cf","16c1f36fcbf1abb32664f7c6aae7e6c2651d3ed3","07d60eb20a77ba232c7bd74f3da45452da9ba488","67548529695ba7f337d5c8238d0eb037d1e64222","3491b33001369174ab2004640033fc8afdd5f205","4813a27bbb14abb0df62e43be8b0a8667f114076","29b4764fda7c960526ca10995e6269928c743a1a","474dd7191603a3b0eaf0b9163b0695cb31f756f9"],"title":"Causal assessment of surrogacy in a meta-analysis of colorectal cancer trials.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq082"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2016,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The annals of applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Research in dental caries generates data with two levels of hierarchy: that of a tooth overall and that of the different surfaces of the tooth. The outcomes often exhibit spatial referencing among neighboring teeth and surfaces, i.e., the disease status of a tooth or surface might be influenced by the status of a set of proximal teeth/surfaces. Assessments of dental caries (tooth decay) at the tooth level yield binary outcomes indicating the presence/absence of teeth, and trinary outcomes at the surface level indicating healthy, decayed, or filled surfaces. The presence of these mixed discrete responses complicates the data analysis under a unified framework. To mitigate complications, we develop a Bayesian two-level hierarchical model under suitable (spatial) Markov random field assumptions that accommodates the natural hierarchy within the mixed responses. At the first level, we utilize an autologistic model to accommodate the spatial dependence for the tooth-level binary outcomes. For the second level and conditioned on a tooth being non-missing, we utilize a Potts model to accommodate the spatial referencing for the surface-level trinary outcomes. The regression models at both levels were controlled for plausible covariates (risk factors) of caries, and remain connected through shared parameters. To tackle the computational challenges in our Bayesian estimation scheme caused due to the doubly-intractable normalizing constant, we employ a double Metropolis-Hastings sampler. We compare and contrast our model performances to the standard non-spatial (naive) model using a small simulation study, and illustrate via an application to a clinical dataset on dental caries.","inCitations":["b87e488011c199b1ba2e9bc5c5132a81ca4c71a4"],"title":"A Bayesian Hierarchical Spatial Model for Dental Caries Assessment Using Non-gaussian Markov Random Fields.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS917"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2019,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Waterfall plots are used to describe changes in tumor size observed in clinical studies. They are frequently used to illustrate the overall drug response in oncology clinical trials because of its simple representation of results. Unfortunately, this visual display suffers a number of limitations including (1) potential misguidance by masking the time dynamics of tumor size, (2) ambiguous labelling of the y-axis, and (3) low data-to-ink ratio. We offer some alternatives to address these shortcomings and recommend moving away from waterfall plots to the benefit of plots showing the individual time profiles of sum of lesion diameters (according to RECIST). The spider plot presents the individual changes in tumor measurements over time relative to baseline tumor burden. Baseline tumor size is a well-known confounding factor of drug effect which has to be accounted for when analyzing data in early clinical trials. While spider plots are conveniently correct for baseline tumor size, they cannot be presented in isolation. Indeed, percentage change from baseline has suboptimal statistical properties (including skewed distribution) and can be overly optimistic in favor of drug efficacy. We argued that plots of raw data (referred to as spaghetti plots) should always accompany spider plots to provide an equipoised illustration of the drug effect on lesion diameters.","inCitations":["301b149f2958ef0531c9ab7b91acc9d04277aff2","5053b1f20f57797dfecc5e6637cca7bcada72af6"],"title":"From waterfall plots to spaghetti plots in early oncology clinical development.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1944"}

Hereby, a standard problem of interest is whether or not to pool a given number of batches to assign a single shelf life for the combined batches. In this paper, we propose two modified methods for the pooling process. One is based on the relative average drug contents of batches at a target shelf life, which basically involves specification of thresholds in relative terms, and the other is tests for the equivalence of shelf lives (using ratios of shelf lives) at a specified lower acceptance criteria of label claim. For both approaches, marginal and simultaneous confidence intervals are established. The methods will be illustrated using two different stability data. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the coverage probability of the proposed methods.","inCitations":["5eff598d5ce5e8f70896d2ae5e5c106f8a7dc149","ce1c54c0d7e82cade0662f48509815ce3146c03f"],"title":"Equivalence tests for shelf life and average drug content in stability studies.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802287230"}

In applications in which this assumption is violated, the standard inferential approach of using the generalized estimating equations may lead to biased inference. Current methods require the correct specification of either the observation time process or the repeated measure process with a correct covariance structure. In this article, we construct a novel pairwise likelihood method for longitudinal data that allows for dependence between observation times and outcomes. This method investigates the marginal covariate effects on the repeated measure process, while leaving the probability structure of the observation time process unspecified. The novelty of this method is that it yields consistent estimator of the marginal covariate effects without specification of the observation time process or the covariance structure of the repeated measures process. Large sample properties of the regression coefficient estimates and a pairwise likelihood ratio test procedure are established. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in finite samples. An analysis of weight loss data from a web-based program is presented to illustrate the proposed method.","inCitations":["97e73a66b1d39439e5f3889b0b26329e0200dc78","8135a0cd8fe536885e86bf087432ff33c0379d17","747b273e0f37c3d34f5d7c5bd487a6605d6b0a08"],"title":"Regression analysis of longitudinal data with irregular and informative observation times.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv008"}

In this paper, we consider models for W that include interactions between X and Z. We derive the conditional distribution of X given W and Z and use it to extend the method of regression calibration to this class of measurement error models. We apply the model to dietary data and test whether self-reported dietary intake includes an interaction between true intake and body mass index.

When count data exhibiting inflated zero counts are correlated among subjects, a natural approach will be to fit a marginal model with the help of generalized estimating equations (GEE) that can incorporate subject-to-subject correlations. A GEE based zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model is proposed to fit clustered counts with excessive zeros. However, the corresponding sandwich variance estimator appears to underestimate the true variance. The theoretical reasons for its failure are explained and a correction under additional modeling assumptions is offered. In addition, a clustered resampling (bootstrap) procedure is proposed to estimate the variance and it is shown that the bootstrap procedure captures the correct variance under no additional model assumptions. Utility of this marginal GEE based ZINB model over two other competing models has been assessed using a thorough simulation study. The resulting inference procedure is applied to study the association between the dental caries and fluoride exposures using a dataset extracted from the Iowa Fluoride Study. A number of risk factors of clinical significance are reliably identified using the proposed model.","inCitations":["93da66370a25942b9897396a9434b79f0064e5db","1c2fdbed272e28622ed4fab4b8ebc5ba5ff75c91","e39f2e87101adb99e99282c8585c24372b980496","d3bd657f94c91e7a7603d5f60639b40a7c5670d0","7cd80c1a5179e9c4026a7916413a4a48b89178d8","882c3b7c595bc753717ea81ce60ae6c194c31b04","fbbee8268b61d747f8cee00fa5be9a8138db9b58"],"title":"GEE type inference for clustered zero-inflated negative binomial regression with application to dental caries","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2014.11.014"}

Yet, even when misspecified, parametric and semi-parametric estimators can possess better operating characteristics in small sample sizes due to smaller variance than non-parametric estimators. Fundamentally, this is a bias-variance trade-off situation in that the sample size is not large enough to take advantage of the low bias of non-parametric estimation. Stacked survival models estimate an optimally weighted combination of models that can span parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric models by minimizing prediction error. An extensive simulation study demonstrates that stacked survival models consistently perform well across a wide range of scenarios by adaptively balancing the strengths and weaknesses of individual candidate survival models. In addition, stacked survival models perform as well as or better than the model selected through cross-validation. Finally, stacked survival models are applied to a well-known German breast cancer study.","inCitations":["84a7569c9b294504031b22446c16a6bcc7cd27f3","d823f5913e8675bffe0a6650d25f64d5531d50d5","fce1de9a2b7bd4fe7dc2db2a95994c4a3641086a","fbd176988a8359ba048134e27badaf83f4add6d1","1bc8cda4933fa5ad34a4eccd38d80d0d4b5c6a2a","4a8494b153f2141083e317283e9d5538033aa631","2a2be84011cc690f97ea1407013420e031d7b5d7"],"title":"Combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric survival models with stacked survival models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv001"}

It directly models the conditional quantile of the survival time and hence is easy to interpret. Moreover, it relaxes the proportionality constraint on the hazard function associated with the popular Cox model and is natural for modeling heterogeneity of the data. Recently, Wang and Wang (2009. Locally weighted censored quantile regression. Journal of the American Statistical Association 103, 1117-1128) proposed a locally weighted censored quantile regression approach that allows for covariate-dependent censoring and is less restrictive than other censored quantile regression methods. However, their kernel smoothing-based weighting scheme requires all covariates to be continuous and encounters practical difficulty with even a moderate number of covariates. We propose a new weighting approach that uses recursive partitioning, e.g. survival trees, that offers greater flexibility in handling covariate-dependent censoring in moderately high dimensions and can incorporate both continuous and discrete covariates. We prove that this new weighting scheme leads to consistent estimation of the quantile regression coefficients and demonstrate its effectiveness via Monte Carlo simulations. We also illustrate the new method using a widely recognized data set from a clinical trial on primary biliary cirrhosis.","inCitations":["341ca1161457ca4a5854c2725a731a4ed825ce8e","979a07577411b5f5284912682bf5eedd93cbc8ff","84a7569c9b294504031b22446c16a6bcc7cd27f3","daefbb27db0ea94b26df1fcbbdd6f627edb77087","8f9607025cefc808f84da7faca25c23c401005e6","cc3c89685486bbd8f2445b998aa4e7da02e9efa0","1bc8cda4933fa5ad34a4eccd38d80d0d4b5c6a2a","0880058181683d1c3341e845e6e07746b137c2c1"],"title":"Censored quantile regression with recursive partitioning-based weights.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt027"}

Examples include the BZI Poisson (BZIP), BZI negative binomial (BZINB) models, etc. Such formulations vary in the basic modeling aspect and use the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird and Rubin, 1977) for parameter estimation. A different modeling formulation in the Bayesian context is given by Dagne (2004). We extend the modeling to a more general setting for multivariate ZIP models for count data with excess zeros as proposed by Li, Lu, Park, Kim, Brinkley and Peterson (1999), focusing on a particular bivariate regression formulation. For the basic formulation in the case of bivariate data, we assume that Xi are (latent) independent Poisson random variables with parameters ? i, i = 0, 1, 2. A bi-variate count vector (Y1, Y2) response follows a mixture of four distributions; p0 stands for the mixing probability of a point mass distribution at (0, 0); p1, the mixing probability that Y2 = 0, while Y1 = X0 + X1; p2, the mixing probability that Y1 = 0 while Y2 = X0 + X2; and finally (1 - p0 - p1 - p2), the mixing probability that Yi = Xi + X0, i = 1, 2. The choice of the parameters {pi, ? i, i = 0, 1, 2} ensures that the marginal distributions of Yi are zero inflated Poisson (? 0 + ? i). All the parameters thus introduced are allowed to depend on co-variates through canonical link generalized linear models (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). This flexibility allows for a range of real-life applications, especially in the medical and biological fields, where the counts are bivariate in nature (with strong association between the processes) and where there are excess of zeros in one or both processes. Our contribution in this paper is to employ a fully Bayesian approach consolidating the work of Dagne (2004) and Li et al. (1999) generalizing the modeling and sampling-based methods described by Ghosh, Mukhopadhyay and Lu (2006) to estimate the parameters and obtain posterior credible intervals both in the case where co-variates are not available as well as in the case where they are. In this context, we provide explicit data augmentation techniques that lend themselves to easier implementation of the Gibbs sampler by giving rise to well-known and closed-form posterior distributions in the bivariate ZIP case. We then use simulations to explore the effectiveness of this estimation using the Bayesian BZIP procedure, comparing the performance to the Bayesian and classical ZIP approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the methodology based on bivariate plant count data with excess zeros that was collected on plots in the Phoenix metropolitan area and compare the results with independent ZIP regression models fitted to both processes.","inCitations":["234010871497b1c73bb13d2fb2bad718edb61f15","a4946d44bd0f9738810c0df5e391834ec607732a","96b1f9f23bd9c57bcbfbca2ed322a1938f1bedf2"],"title":"Bivariate Zero-Inflated Regression for Count Data: A Bayesian Approach with Application to Plant Counts","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1229"}

Testing hypotheses with multiple primary endpoints may require unmanageably large populations. Composite endpoints consisting of several binary events may be used to reduce a trial to a manageable size. The primary difficulties with composite endpoints are that different endpoints may have different clinical importance and that higher-frequency variables may overwhelm effects of smaller, but equally important, primary outcomes. To compensate for these inconsistencies, we weight each type of event, and the total number of weighted events is counted. To reflect the mutual dependency of primary endpoints and to make the weighting method effective in small clinical trials, we use the Bayesian approach. We assume a multinomial distribution of multiple endpoints with Dirichlet priors and apply the Bayesian test of noninferiority to the calculation of weighting parameters. We use composite endpoints to test hypotheses of superiority in single-arm and two-arm clinical trials. The composite endpoints have a beta distribution. We illustrate this technique with an example. The results provide a statistical procedure for creating composite endpoints.","inCitations":["10b0c2ddc9781cf4fdeebefd0eae356cbb653db6"],"title":"Bayesian design and analysis of composite endpoints in clinical trials with multiple dependent binary outcomes.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1572"}

However these variables may not yield an estimated optimal dynamic regime that is close to the optimal regime which uses all variables. The question of selecting tailoring variables has not yet been answered satisfactorily, though promising new approaches have been proposed. We compare the use of reductsa variable selection tool from computer sciencesto the S-score criterion proposed by Gunter and colleagues in 2007 for suggesting collections of useful variables for treatment regime tailoring. Although the reducts-based approach promised several advantages such as the ability to account for correlation among tailoring variables, it proved to have several undesirable properties. The S-score performed better, though it too exhibited some disappointing qualities.","inCitations":["3ae1cc3304d7dca4bb2f4ddb4089935c9a986949","c732686f5595d16e67866f85c49cf35573f14aaf","0e739d92688a413b0eeb693817543372bd4acc7e"],"title":"A Comparison of Variable Selection Approaches for Dynamic Treatment Regimes","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1178"}
