{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2017,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In drug development programs, an experimental treatment is evaluated across different populations and/or disease types using multiple studies conducted in countries around the world. In order to show the efficacy and safety in a specific population, a bridging study may be required. There are therapeutic areas for which enrolling patients to a trial is very challenging. Therefore, it is of interest to utilize the available historical information from previous studies. However, treatment effect may vary across different subpopulations/disease types; therefore, directly utilizing outcomes from historical studies may result in a biased estimation of treatment effect under investigation in the target trial. In this article, we propose novel approaches using both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks that allow borrowing information from historical studies while accounting for relevant patient's covariates via a propensity-based weighting. We evaluate the operating characteristics of the proposed methods in a simulation study and demonstrate that under certain conditions these methods may lead to improved estimation of a treatment effect.","inCitations":["8484be05b4d17eb466f6b1098e559f82127daabf","31757e4a8f4eab2f7d4763676a49f3e2d4e91103"],"title":"Bridging data across studies using frequentist and Bayesian estimation.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1289948"}

Noncentrality, power, and sample size inherit the randomness. Additional complexity arises if the estimate has been censored. Left censoring occurs when only significant tests lead to a power calculation, while right censoring occurs when only non-significant tests lead to a power calculation. We provide simple expressions for straightforward computation of the distribution function, moments, and quantiles of the censored variance estimate, estimated noncentrality, power, and sample size. We also provide convenient approximations and evaluate their accuracy. The results allow demonstrating that ignoring right censoring falsely widens confidence intervals for noncentrality and power, while ignoring left censoring falsely narrows the confidence intervals. The new results allow assessing and avoiding the potentially substantial bias that censoring may create.","inCitations":["0935abb3bcd51c7496b9c9ed49297ba8ec0ec125","8287ac4ee24116c3c192e6c2e35fd4c46c22a33b","927db798d05b8a1a83b92f0f893519292ce8fec1","eb6d945a9c22b90f1d0cfa3d9925995071235bd2","0cbbd0f4038c54f51ce74d408c842db9e72254aa","092562bb1809063bcb04d0c68bdc87de45b96e6d","816df603ad5b94fe8d3534dadbed28ec03295046","98407ef35673ad83a1b24fcb6ce5a85c0689de42","8ead297e23fe077bde64fc11edb4fc37ca227087","42f3b7ebc059a6afbeba37d477893abfe086b7b7","54c76520db0581af203600ae6bba74595f138326"],"title":"Bias in Linear Model Power and Sample Size Due to Estimating Variance.","doi":"10.1080/03610929708831953"}

To eliminate the problem of clustering, we randomly select a data point from each cluster and for this now independent data, and calculate our test statistic and the associated support points for all possible permutations. While clearly valid, this is also inefficient. We repeat this process until all possible independent data sets have been created and use the support points averaged over the randomly created data sets as our reference distribution for the averaged test statistic. This approach uses all of the data and is a permutation extension of within-cluster resampling (WCR). We discuss both exact and Monte Carlo versions of the approach and apply it to several data sets. WCR permutation can be applied in quite general settings when within cluster correlation is a nuisance and exact inference is necessary.","inCitations":["71bbd89c05a03a36aae14bf083537ce7b30fd907","f6631813a36fa83bafe367338530a6eda30e3659","107253197fbcd62a432e1ce2fe7b43442f6e2e85","04cb3d98ec4d343191e03267ff0deef94d91ca12"],"title":"Exact inference for complex clustered data using within-cluster resampling.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003618884"}

Existing continuous-time methods for modeling such data are based on point processes and directly model interaction \"contagion,\" whereby one interaction increases the propensity of future interactions among actors, often as dictated by some latent variable structure. In this article, we present an alternative approach to using temporal-relational point process models for continuous-time event data. We characterize interactions between a pair of actors as either spurious or as resulting from an underlying, persistent connection in a latent social network. We argue that consistent deviations from expected behavior, rather than solely high frequency counts, are crucial for identifying well-established underlying social relationships. This study aims to explore these latent network structures in two contexts: one comprising of college students and another involving barn swallows.","inCitations":["fd24124bd6f2323514cb117511b0d24bf3171769"],"title":"Inferring social structure from continuous-time interaction data.","doi":"10.1002/asmb.2285"}

These approaches assume that data are missing completely at random (MCAR). Multiple imputation (MI) and likelihood-based repeated measures (MMRM) are less restrictive as they assume data are missing at random (MAR). Nevertheless, LOCF and BOCF remain popular, perhaps because it is thought that the bias in these methods lead to protection against falsely concluding that a drug is more effective than the control. We conducted a simulation study that compared the rate of false positive results or regulatory risk error (RRE) from BOCF, LOCF, MI, and MMRM in 32 scenarios that were generated from a 2(5) full factorial arrangement with data missing due to a missing not at random (MNAR) mechanism. Both BOCF and LOCF inflated RRE were compared to MI and MMRM. In 12 of the 32 scenarios, BOCF yielded inflated RRE compared with eight scenarios for LOCF, three scenarios for MI and four scenarios for MMRM. In no situation did BOCF or LOCF provide adequate control of RRE when MI and MMRM did not. Both MI and MMRM are better choices than either BOCF or LOCF for the primary analysis.","inCitations":["2acfb111f0796767b65b0deed1fbab4f3e6983ba","a872ee9487fc2c03ab5c665890493ec55d08a016","3a956c1988f54fd0b018c678d1134579f485d780","2cb2a269bd6ad119302f93e389d426cbb08f0758","bc137cdf79be786f65fa8cbe0f0916a1733d6362","1f2430da1057504253317824ef3210b920b6ea73","d3da502a0a38cb65a9e0310200d2c1ea42dcab8d","8f423555448ca2040a25a8db3f9878ac2521f458","107204e9a312f3a44f07db023140958d895b0d0f","f83e2fe2f3761cc7b96d3e747e0c5edc113bb176","378bf3b6cb68e164d78face6a8d201141db58e7e","bc79d3a66b29638e15576d9b1642ff316b96153d","6f8a5d374ad1b1c1f3c921ff974d793c4f91115b","d99f35864dbbd1c1733b7276c11abbf945a09f6e","574637eedf9be50ce009d5933f3696ceab52dadd","a5352241e07687ca770c58152f8cec2b7ebb3fcc","4c1062abb5d288b106255819c5f75309714e4d43","e044257d4711d9608ea7e1762f368018242d192d","e8409c579f3603d71e32339b51dbab1a8fd580c4","da248e37465b04399b21563f4980a3c85d2e04bc","4c15b644980f5f392530861f8b2bfd4413a64e7c","aa160c132be45fad3f734a7fe32e44daf5d70aee","4bb9542c2f3028c2906a7c93be8a7e32f0220fb2","5e9ce68926f033fe52163f1bfd0ff72069ff0820"],"title":"The impact of missing data and how it is handled on the rate of false-positive results in drug development.","doi":"10.1002/pst.310"}

With high-dimensional data, the incorporation of variable selection into meta-analysis improves model interpretation and prediction. Existing variable selection methods require direct access to raw data, which may not be available in practical situations. We propose a new approach, sparse meta-analysis (SMA), in which variable selection for meta-analysis is based solely on summary statistics and the effect sizes of each covariate are allowed to vary among studies. We show that the SMA enjoys the oracle property if the estimated covariance matrix of the parameter estimators from each study is available. We also show that our approach achieves selection consistency and estimation consistency even when summary statistics include only the variance estimators or no variance/covariance information at all.

And data dependency due to multiple use of the same subjects exists ubiquitously in order to generate more samples because of limited resources. Hence, a two-layer data structure is constructed and the nonparametric two-sample two-layer bootstrap is employed to estimate standard errors of statistics of interest derived from two sets of data, such as a weighted sum of two probabilities. In this article, to reduce the bootstrap variance and ensure the accuracy of computation, Monte Carlo studies of bootstrap variability were carried out to determine the appropriate number of bootstrap replications in ROC analysis with data dependency. It is suggested that with a tolerance 0.02 of the coefficient of variation, 2,000 bootstrap replications be appropriate under such circumstances.","inCitations":["9e5bc7f09ea83a31ac35342b49130754cb2170e2"],"title":"Monte Carlo studies of bootstrap variability in ROC analysis with data dependency","doi":"10.1080/03610918.2018.1521974"}

Missing data in medical device studies can arise for all the reasons one might expect in pharmaceutical clinical trials. In addition, they occur by design, in nonrandomized device studies, and in evaluations of diagnostic tests. For dichotomous endpoints, a tipping point analysis can be used to examine nonparametrically the sensitivity of conclusions to missing data. In general, sensitivity analysis is an important tool to study deviations from simple assumptions about missing data, such as the data being missing at random. Approaches to missing data in Bayesian trials are discussed, including sensitivity analysis. Many types of missing data that can occur with diagnostic test evaluations are surveyed. Careful planning and conduct are recommended to minimize missing data. Although difficult, the prespecification of all missing data analysis strategies is encouraged before any data are collected.","inCitations":["6092209af1d26af97b5bb409a4f585ede791d972","27c4a9fd444f7a254b7a6b262b5c010fcf11780e","ced8dbfb3973af7249169891c6a41776e1080c8c","07cfb01dd32334656c441fb1ee15216eeaee2292","599a266a17f337b17e78fa388c795d9d916c5fb9","e7f687cf50716ab71b48f95076c86faf86c41af4","3a87edd619d7baba6324c364987584fad054878a","74b2dcc6f5b00245a0b199cf1bb1dfc64ab67424","5dd18a3ac79e1f14ed21f9e0bf9f1dc8f972d84b"],"title":"Missing data in the regulation of medical devices.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.550094"}

In this study, we propose new formal tests for lack of symmetry by using spectral representations of the spatial-temporal covariance functions. The advantage of the proposed tests is that classical analysis of variance (ANOVA) models can be used for detecting lack of symmetry inherent in spatial-temporal processes.

Recent developments made it possible to characterize some desired properties in terms of a collection of manifest ones, so that hypothesis tests on these traits can, in principle, be performed. But the existing test methodology is based on asymptotic approximation, which is impractical in most applications since the required sample sizes are often unrealistically huge. To overcome this problem, a class of tests is proposed for making exact statistical inference about four manifest properties: covariances given the sum are non-positive (CSN), manifest monotonicity (MM), conditional association (CA), and vanishing conditional dependence (VCD). One major advantage is that these exact tests do not require large sample sizes. As a result, tests for CSN and MM can be routinely performed in empirical studies. For testing CA and VCD, the exact methods are still impractical in most applications, due to the unusually large number of parameters to be tested. However, exact methods are still derived for them as an exploration toward practicality. Some numerical examples with applications of the exact tests for CSN and MM are provided.","inCitations":["330b5056f383672aa1ed170e3865c1690f4a6189"],"title":"Some exact tests for manifest properties of latent trait models","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2010.04.022"}

The method assumes that outcome remains constant at the last observed value after dropout, which is unlikely in many clinical trials. Recently, random-effects regression models have become popular for analysis of longitudinal clinical trial data with dropouts. However, inference obtained from random-effects regression models is valid when the missing-at-random dropout process is present. The random-effects pattern-mixture model, on the other hand, provides an approach that is valid under more general missingness mechanisms. In this article we describe the use of random-effects pattern-mixture models under different patterns for dropouts. First, subjects are divided into groups depending on their missing-data patterns, and then model parameters are estimated for each pattern. Finally, overall estimates are obtained by averaging over the missing-data patterns and corresponding standard errors are obtained using the delta method. A typical longitudinal clinical trial data set is used to illustrate and compare the above methods of data analyses in the presence of missing data due to dropouts.","inCitations":["b60e7fca7f9d89f741b4a67b066f09fe2174a983","f757656b7275165c695314aa82511dfa831388a5","13454bb59d62d06a17bc3adfeab137cf2490ddc9","45b36a9d5a41b87c5988a963ad46ad3bbc69e287","d04e69b830952974c47d6fae1500804dbc2461eb","c015f310785b59c90d1a742076d12fbf4b5c6d72","6c36ac90d954110f4fcf56c0eb6e28826493d227","3ace06ed3d17d17d8314a106c78e283dc526729d","fdbc07a93973782f05a5c556470a494d91a08142","12ced0d0c63833ba00cd57b7d978bd4a7d9b5153","341153ce03c5888f15e47ca47e8808df5d8e096e","6e6362fa54828006448e3f1451cab0a2124caf8d","dd0f63157c47d6f9247eeef587c08c0fa63f1af1","cd4e92f69382105f3570258945870bac4ba096a1","f506faf983c31cbdf8aea2b8e942e12bd5920521","2acfb111f0796767b65b0deed1fbab4f3e6983ba","7de181d83938ef26138dcccc63b6c55a00cb893f","6fb88b86446e038dfb8d37a1b464a19c30260060","e74dfe2152b19cdc5a27507b17336b2246aaaea1","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","dda7a723f7413f366ad6dbc198a001f4eb85d639","4c1062abb5d288b106255819c5f75309714e4d43","6bf59c019cb87c37601cd084ace66187e79a7812","c9b813a20b67802d290bd448bb9421a161d875d2","afaf786e8c4fb059b20d13dc7001fdc7cb606063","a0ece4aea1258a2e69d7f48f947d923adeb775d7","1480fdc6c9532a8ea0c8b21ed142888849411cde","28c2a4b5adb14c7c38f1a51ee5352b70ff4ef23f","450c43ae5d106c6fcff6a25e8de6ce375911aafd","7f3c83d64bbe754c0d1aa79d4174458620c1e31a","724e378ddd514a302f5ef83c082cd0087d0e33ee","607cbd5000cd1e13e694d43971b58922e0de64c1","3ce42fdbff3dacd746588c52e91a00e271690e9d","f0998541d159bbe2d108f64b7fedba7029055775","bc79d3a66b29638e15576d9b1642ff316b96153d","ff5b020a5227fda188a189b94dbf0085c03f16b5","7c6a60456d1cf7716721bc1415069ed85f9809e3","22f5504f4579ffc64dbc01c562e523c0a233bee7","9e8cb49a63ab26534fad058c3316f58c974f0458","3ab01f3f9dfac5654fc9b2ed01012a8fa25c514f","d8a0a3ad4df33fc761486e2c6a54eea355f6b374","ce181ad45680ce95d48ac018b81842b79a29320d","0c11cfb0c06b6ccbc3dfaffd235d1f268e511878","74db76d8fd8c7bb705cadc442b3b9e0c0a63f330","233bb57838ef991286eb86a4841271c383ee5951","aca9697a7dad704a4b311fcc7e4b67e4043ff3a0","21a79fc77f5726f9cd11f7f180fac82751472b2e","7d419acb006506fe75832aa0599a6dc87a9a8235","eb559144e75c3160b96dff60f61eff64b2988d15","d325934265e498c5271b3691266ec4a5cea9110a","5ee38e2cee6a7b9b31e42bf6c6dc3a6c6e81a158","a71c7f67a9d73d989979b1479b6fca4826379502","b03045ba5708147a49d31e20b2ee6062ff873a30","c643024f1045900bedf55323c4bc47c498fa8189","312048e52d1cabf739d1b62d7bc088458c94b9b5","1de0226e85393b367a3fd8006a1a017c61dbb8e7","94be9375d192498953d4b20e6e2e32e775b9cfc7","548352cf45d94472791b5d052f2c0e7bd37cc25b","5e9ce68926f033fe52163f1bfd0ff72069ff0820","57202c7a18ae262cadcc69b86b5a4a130a11d544","25b3faeb7bf00cddee7ac8543dbd6e5215ef7537","b7b30fc7dfc2ff9f59159033770059a1e5cbe2b3","b8d0b42889614f1f92ae91916ecc1c1d5890a488","ab4cd22a2ab5b275c5a104179aab858434b87010","4d330be432dbcff97548e424afd1ca25d1e53ed5","8189c9b7a235abe7925986e6584a182f790441b9","2f7631dd2bc67b005d1750d19c1e8e7ec45c276c","a14de2914eb801c261d3fc37b62d509716bbca82","dd796363c66c5ad063bda91a1dfb7ab95e4b1abc","62386ff4a83cc44db2f6195405a2058c3efdc7ff"],"title":"A comparison of the random-effects pattern mixture model with last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analysis in longitudinal clinical trials with dropouts.","doi":"10.1080/10543409808835259"}

The goal is to jointly answer the questions (1) is the new drug or the control toxic? (2) Is the new drug more effective and safer than the control? We consider a bivariate model where each treatment is characterized by a target effect (a continuous primary response y) and by a side effect (a continuous supplementary response xi). Using a Bayesian approach, we account for the uncertainty resulting from prediction of the side effect, by making use of the physician's prior inputs about the target-toxicity relationship and the maximum tolerated target effects that are considered to be safe. Finally, we consider an example about a sleeplessness drug, and we show that the Bayes factor provides a more flexible and informative tool than the likelihood ratio test in simultaneous testing. Advantages are greater when the number of experimental subjects is small.","inCitations":["1cdd577664e04625fb0346e2f0624a4910f0e606"],"title":"Testing simultaneous hypotheses in pharmaceutical trials: a Bayesian approach.","doi":"10.1080/10543409808835239"}

The work is motivated by and tries to mimic the phenomenal success of the partial autocorrelations function (PACF) in model formulation, removing the positive-definiteness constraint on the autocorrelation function of a stationary time series and in reparameterizing the stationarity-invertibility domain of ARMA models. It turns out that once an order is fixed among the variables of a general random vector, then the above properties continue to hold and follows from establishing a one-to-one correspondence between a correlation matrix and its associated matrix of partial autocorrelations. Connections between the latter and the parameters of the modified Cholesky decomposition of a covariance matrix are discussed. Graphical tools similar to partial correlograms for model formulation and various priors based on the partial autocorrelations are proposed. We develop frequentist/Bayesian procedures for modelling correlation matrices, illustrate them using a real dataset, and explore their properties via simulations.","inCitations":["3eca4ce8390dba626537d458b24a90dbabc0ccf7","f5c7db5c64f88a843844b0821032543916545af4","1285fa3fdd74829838c89c71e6306ae287f88d80","a766ed0b21bda73c466bf10c058d8dea1f66bfc3","5827bf516d0fc91c90cd7d55b2c912886a2aabe6","cbd4877c13ea54bba592638fceaefe599bce2512","5316d5bf44d3dbae8607d652c6f09cdd8e7eca71","5bfb2e66dcc15c9f3ba098105e23cbfe2ae3618c","f70582acec8c128bf37428bf110c7bd5c825f95e","dd1d56deb3e918145117f0946201404a54247cd7","a37cc2c01dd2fee449da14a59cf170d3d816c815","e5756cc3e771cef6caddb8c76031c90da1e82abf","d18c32d00e48705997e789ab7341480a26a1694a","7962843c796ff01f0a935c07c32bacf1d4c9c4b6","584a26036b2da0014d4110306fdd014ac832ddbc","77c49090e7df68abf1bae4dab41b9fb933393609","1bef9ff36e9e33742b8751c8e244efdf32f28c1b","aa2edaae5fab4600bfe83367af89106a5d8dd3e6","eafc3b3296997136b3f701a7b135a52fb1a6f397","166ef76509a40056d95bc2806bea00bda70e4dcd","0e00b8e08ccccb1a33ff48f8fa767472a3bfad50","6c23dd9abe949ef9fbdfeca12c7fd678ae97e743","95ab719fde9b23817a548c823519f8fd0220d8e0","4b32108228345a0f4a75769bebeeb91638603635","46ebc0c907d9f40a93b99e76a3055db90490107c","9b3a0c580fa715a0ab85e94f02d10fecb159a5dd","944b71dbc3df67f570bd103a437b54ee91fc4e82","cdb043359773b3e59e12bfd4424edd3743c7343c","f514d4ccfdfea9c3ee77b353d54ed72a2ffe13eb","884d6380b37da70394a66996baa860f866e33928","0597afd1d2eddebf2c8ef91350dffddb6617bf24","928d6b8b4333f0899276d9f1d357c0bc6a0a2a92","09ceb180ac12113855fd6a35408b1141e7bbda1a","15a38e9de903754448318692177e593992178c2b","09f71d20f2521e48604011a34fcd5f700978c672","276106d3667e5d4aa09f438cc3a7f2bad678364e","303657558fbf9b5be9ae7c3381e7fae16ece0d95","fe40c74cc7ad774e32fff19f34f67db13afd199f","bb6ab5d4a2324803c20264965b504371554a6041","90b7445fc5392fe821541400590413031b5f0b1d","869e58fcc4d181cdff2ebf5c9b1c295cc29a3fe6"],"title":"Modeling covariance matrices via partial autocorrelations","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2009.04.015"}

However, he also explored many other lesser known aspects of mathematical statistics. This is a survey of one of those areas, initiated by a seminal paper in 2005, on high dimension low sample size asymptotics. An interesting characteristic of that first paper, and of many of the following papers, is that they contain deep and insightful concepts which are frequently surprising and counter-intuitive, yet have mathematical underpinnings which tend to be direct and not difficult to prove.","inCitations":["b1f6c79ca78f1593457039f8cb318e71545fcbd1","600a0ed3466eb7ea65e886b9f07ebfd160402a75","23a798df272c57c7b7e3f628050d4d9712a90a60","ff53f865304b6dcad83eb30882b829985eaf2a46"],"title":"A survey of high dimension low sample size asymptotics.","doi":"10.1111/anzs.12212"}
