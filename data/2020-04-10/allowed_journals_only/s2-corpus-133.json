Yet, there has been no research on effect size index relevant to coefficient alpha to our knowledge. Considering the importance of effect size in understanding quantitative research findings, we therefore developed an effect size index Delta for the comparison of two independent alphas with equal test length based on the asymptotic distribution of (1/2)ln(1 - alphahat) under the assumptions of normality and compound symmetry. Simulations indicated that the index was applicable when the sample size was at least 100. The robustness of the derived index when the required assumptions were violated was also explored. It is suggested that the index should be applicable in most cases of unequal test lengths and could be extended to non-normally distributed component scores. Moreover, a small simulation was conducted to explore the behaviour of Delta with correlated errors, a frequently studied situation violating the assumption of compound symmetry. The proposed index was found to be robust unless a large number of highly correlated errors were present in the data.","inCitations":["aef20138a784524ec793f1300da6b817ab6d52f4","adda0f8e2e124b6e652cd42cf452ff6f74dac8e3","83675c519c758a832f29de6a7d3a0c13ac8cc01b","bf4a2f33c964cd4080409b3993424b767ca70a72"],"title":"An effect size index for comparing two independent alpha coefficients.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X315518"}

However, the efficiency of a GEE estimate can be seriously affected by the choice of the working correlation model. This study addresses this problem by proposing a hybrid method that combines multiple GEEs based on different working correlation models, using the empirical likelihood method (Qin and Lawless, 1994). Analyses show that this hybrid method is more efficient than a GEE using a misspecified working correlation model. Furthermore, if one of the working correlation structures correctly models the within-subject correlations, then this hybrid method provides the most efficient parameter estimates. In simulations, the hybrid method's finite-sample performance is superior to a GEE under any of the commonly used working correlation models and is almost fully efficient in all scenarios studied. The hybrid method is illustrated using data from a longitudinal study of the respiratory infection rates in 275 Indonesian children.","inCitations":["06144cb9d8cce367f3523e5a33396f1a9d2d2dbc","08e6d64ce12955f6d00de8536d47f5f914df6dee","e13cc0d197c5a0ad88882abfba47192303e009df","1424690d67a2b6e764c431c41618376711d84549","11dd8f00a5c7c79f02eacea844045edd03e543ad","ddc4da4c6a3b4a86c40e3f0e98cea3b280b5b1f0","90f52933b7e5f39dbd0c393fe392accce2a2b676","ce1053ca52180a015f0f1fe4bfd51c71f548f8a3","9f40c76af2c16bd96d0f97669e488f3946446077","24e4b6d515a54b4dc792ebf1671ec6a884592757","8a1b7d7926c260322916aa2118ed9e5ff4139b94","c6eca2be395d131e36ec31c42d154645ef5b5a1c","4738df375333e972ec63090eb99304c2d5bd637e","ff8f2264ff2efd57c130a48205a438f2b0b85730","30aad921a25b5da7efcbf29bd15c0f9b5838e15f"],"title":"Efficient parameter estimation in longitudinal data analysis using a hybrid GEE method.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp002"}

A major innovation is to take advantage of the commonalities across the multiple precision matrices through possibly nonconvex fusion regularization, which for example makes it possible to achieve simultaneous discovery of unknown disease subtypes and detection of differential gene (dys)regulations in functional genomics. We embed in the EM algorithm one of two recently proposed methods for estimating multiple precision matrices in Gaussian graphical models. We demonstrate the feasibility and potential usefulness of the proposed methods in an application to glioblastoma subtype discovery and differential gene network analysis with a microarray gene expression data set. We also conduct realistic simulation studies to evaluate and compare the performance of various methods.","inCitations":["391df01cf94ec914c2bf055f802ef9a9526f3be3","0515b0fefd2565b19b5c233488baa8c184539d82","2b9acf9866b16d60ad57ad71618caf8c702596d5","8d3c9c4d47dd2d93bc741b674a942d4662461755","466835cbe1d13ddc55ee58443d28712a3a0b1cc0","79b8f3cf38b4373ed9eed187709669e503d7dcb6","1ff73da2c28dc2b028a4f0d53db66d2d35ba8a3b"],"title":"Estimation of multiple networks in Gaussian mixture models.","doi":"10.1214/16-EJS1135"}

The results allow for the data to be cross sectionally dependent, while at the same time allowing the regressors to be only sequentially rather than strictly exogenous. The setup is sufficiently general to accommodate situations where cross sectional dependence stems from spatial interactions and/or from the presence of common factors. The latter leads to the need for random norming. The limit theorem for sample moments is derived by showing that the moment conditions can be recast such that a martingale difference array central limit theorem can be applied. We prove such a central limit theorem by first extending results for stable convergence in Hall and Hedye (1980) to non-nested martingale arrays relevant for our applications.

The physician chooses a treatment at each stage based on the patient's baseline covariates and history of previous treatments and outcomes. Such sequentially adaptive medical decision-making processes are known as dynamic treatment regimes, treatment policies, or multi-stage adaptive treatment strategies. Conventional analyses in terms of frontline treatments that ignore subsequent treatments may be misleading, because they actually are an evaluation of more than front-line treatment effects on outcome. We are motivated by data from a randomized trial of four combination chemotherapies given as frontline treatments to patients with acute leukemia. Most patients in the trial also received a second-line treatment, chosen adaptively and subjectively rather than by randomization, either because the initial treatment was ineffective or the patient's cancer later recurred. We evaluate effects on overall survival time of the 16 two-stage strategies that actually were used. Our methods include a likelihood-based regression approach in which the transition times of all possible multi-stage outcome paths are modeled, and estimating equations with inverse probability of treatment weighting to correct for bias. While the two approaches give different numerical estimates of mean survival time, they lead to the same substantive conclusions when comparing the two-stage regimes.","inCitations":["a4786bb6fe975c4a7c48393ee9aafe60cd8a7021","a367437fc7a9d5e76586c344ac5739a696659042","6e88eb76ee5bd663e3c89bb86973b711c573aa1e","f1232b518ae4b7f05647e68e5db69a753c55eb3c","870ba014a1fe5884e4495dd4c2f7733485b5ada7","a76075646d447db3b97ea24ee921a8dece297d37","4ccba7f094f5aa32b696a5a92f81b9d207b7bca7","3ba394df7ad6f4a39bb1f286f8e6ea3869a1914e","77d075644bc0dfd12ddff1b666460df8903a2973","8711d6b82a745ef50e948c3acf60959b24e699bf"],"title":"Evaluating Joint Effects of Induction-Salvage Treatment Regimes on Overall Survival in Acute Leukemia.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2012.01048.x"}

Hence, a direct application of the Bayesian paradigm in sequential learning becomes apparently useful in the analysis. This paper describes a Bayesian procedure for testing noninferiority in two-arm studies with a binary primary endpoint that allows the incorporation of historical data on an active control via the use of informative priors. In particular, the posteriors of the response in historical trials are assumed as priors for its corresponding parameters in the current trial, where that treatment serves as the active control. The Bayesian procedure includes a fully Bayesian method and two normal approximation methods on the prior and/or on the posterior distributions. Then a common Bayesian decision criterion is used but with two prespecified cutoff levels, one for the approximation methods and the other for the fully Bayesian method, to determine whether the experimental treatment is noninferior to the active control. This criterion is evaluated and compared with the frequentist method using simulation studies in keeping with regulatory framework that new methods must protect type I error and arrive at a similar conclusion with existing standard strategies. Results show that both methods arrive at comparable conclusions of noninferiority when applied to a modified real data set. The advantage of the proposed Bayesian approach lies in its ability to provide posterior probabilities for effect sizes of the experimental treatment over the active control.","inCitations":["a146dad1cf294f3445f4f400bd251e22512a42e5","b3eaae18360751900794dd0b2280d691ff87f1f8","df697101f9e52f078d51900f2537d8c3b2243e00","15db4dd620177ba77358b3855f79248afbbe1123","fecea36d1942c45cee8d43623804bdbeeaf1ff00","095d752af34f4951c22fc5639d641ddcee4ed51e","f2d50a09e063f9de6ca2b1e1c45fb17e5ce3d8a4","93a88de11b983fbeee43e0a597b925c769d50d08","b537abfa7084c5085727f33c669bd633005f7a2e","e922374ddccfa455e491147654c8378ef0c994f9"],"title":"Bayesian approach to noninferiority trials for proportions.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.589646"}

When performing group-level brain connectivity alternation analyses, it is critical to model the dependence structure between multivariate connectivity edges to achieve accurate and efficient estimates of model parameters. However, specifying and estimating dependencies between connectivity edges presents formidable challenges because (i) the dimensionality of parameters in the covariance matrix is high (of the order of the fourth power of the number of nodes); (ii) the covariance between a pair of edges involves four nodes with spatial location information; and (iii) the dependence structure between edges can be related to unknown network topological structures. Existing methods for large covariance/precision matrix regularization and spatial closeness-based dependence structure specification/estimation models may not fully address the complexity and challenges. We develop a new Bayesian nonparametric model that unifies information from brain network areas (nodes), connectivity (edges), and covariance between edges by constructing the function of covariance matrix based on the underlying network topological structure.

Focus is on the test for comparing the means of two independent samples. A launching criterion is adopted in order to evaluate the relevance of phase II results: phase III is run if the effect size estimate is higher than a threshold of clinical importance. The variability in sample size estimation is taken into consideration. Then, the frequentist conservative strategies with a fixed amount of conservativeness and Bayesian strategies are compared. A new conservative strategy is introduced and is based on the calibration of the optimal amount of conservativeness - calibrated optimal strategy (COS). To evaluate the results we compute the Overall Power (OP) of the different strategies, as well as the mean and the MSE of sample size estimators. Bayesian strategies have poor characteristics since they show a very high mean and/or MSE of sample size estimators. COS clearly performs better than the other conservative strategies. Indeed, the OP of COS is, on average, the closest to the desired level; it is also the highest. COS sample size is also the closest to the ideal phase III sample size M(I) , showing averages and MSEs lower than those of the other strategies. Costs and experimental times are therefore considerably reduced and standardized. However, if the ideal sample size M(I) is to be estimated the phase II sample size n should be around the ideal phase III sample size, i.e. n ≥2M(I) /3.","inCitations":["ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb","351a51d7a64cea3b6e16db0c8fd863695784066d","6ae9cd0dc35480f12996d8fb572efea51dc6a41e","67dd7d5371d87f44fe6d34dbd3f4ebd2f7567cb6","5a7877a7a6744ebc9aa33d3edad004ea332e7a27","5b3970158f3869bf2ec247897d8984b528c859ca"],"title":"Adapting by calibration the sample size of a phase III trial on the basis of phase II data.","doi":"10.1002/pst.410"}

The three-stage hierarchical nonlinear mixed model is constructed. Data analysis and model performance comparisons show that GMAP converges the fastest and provides reliable results. At the mean time, data augmentation (DA) methods are used for the Random-walk Metropolis method. Data analysis shows that the speed of the convergence of Random-walk Metropolis can be improved by DA, but all of them are not as fast as GMAP. The performance of GMAP and various MCMC algorithms are compared through Midazolam data analysis and simulation.","inCitations":["9ef649d216e24c7c7dbc4cd70ae3ade6ae1002a0","0fff94dc48cbdaa12af06b671727590e7d5844fa"],"title":"A novel Gibbs maximum a posteriori (GMAP) approach on Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects population pharmacokinetics (PK) models.","doi":"10.1080/10543400902964159"}

The objectives of such studies include not only inferring a hidden state of activity for each unit over individual experiments, but also detecting highly associated clusters of units based on their inferred states. Although there are a number of methods tailored for specific datasets, there is currently no state-of-the-art modeling framework for this general class of problems. In this paper, we develop the MBASIC (Matrix Based Analysis for State-space Inference and Clustering) framework. MBASIC consists of two parts: state-space mapping and state-space clustering. In state-space mapping, it maps observations onto a finite state-space, representing the activation states of units across conditions. In state-space clustering, MBASIC incorporates a finite mixture model to cluster the units based on their inferred state-space profiles across all conditions. Both the state-space mapping and clustering can be simultaneously estimated through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. MBASIC flexibly adapts to a large number of parametric distributions for the observed data, as well as the heterogeneity in replicate experiments. It allows for imposing structural assumptions on each cluster, and enables model selection using information criterion. In our data-driven simulation studies, MBASIC showed significant accuracy in recovering both the underlying state-space variables and clustering structures. We applied MBASIC to two genome research problems using large numbers of datasets from the ENCODE project. The first application grouped genes based on transcription factor occupancy profiles of their promoter regions in two different cell types. The second application focused on identifying groups of loci that are similar to a GATA2 binding site that is functional at its endogenous locus by utilizing transcription factor occupancy data and illustrated applicability of MBASIC in a wide variety of problems. In both studies, MBASIC showed higher levels of raw data fidelity than analyzing these data with a two-step approach using ENCODE results on transcription factor occupancy data.","inCitations":["63bc4996e6be7ebfe397eda67ca9bd6fd45fe21e","39214da130b6f3ded785dbabb74b39855a620fcc"],"title":"A Hierarchical Framework for State-Space Matrix Inference and Clustering.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS938"}

It is natural to apply such a strategy for collecting genetic data in a sub-sample enriched for exposure to environmental factors for gene-environment interaction (G × E) analysis. In this paper, we consider two-phase studies of G × E interaction where phase I data are available on exposure, covariates and disease status. Stratified sampling is done to prioritize individuals for genotyping at phase II conditional on disease and exposure. We consider a Bayesian analysis based on the joint retrospective likelihood of phase I and phase II data. We address several important statistical issues: (i) we consider a model with multiple genes, environmental factors and their pairwise interactions. We employ a Bayesian variable selection algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of this potentially high-dimensional model; (ii) we use the assumption of gene-gene and gene-environment independence to trade-off between bias and efficiency for estimating the interaction parameters through use of hierarchical priors reflecting this assumption; (iii) we posit a flexible model for the joint distribution of the phase I categorical variables using the non-parametric Bayes construction of Dunson and Xing (2009). We carry out a small-scale simulation study to compare the proposed Bayesian method with weighted likelihood and pseudo likelihood methods that are standard choices for analyzing two-phase data. The motivating example originates from an ongoing case-control study of colorectal cancer, where the goal is to explore the interaction between the use of statins (a drug used for lowering lipid levels) and 294 genetic markers in the lipid metabolism/cholesterol synthesis pathway. The sub-sample of cases and controls on which these genetic markers were measured is enriched in terms of statin users. The example and simulation results illustrate that the proposed Bayesian approach has a number of advantages for characterizing joint effects of genotype and exposure over existing alternatives and makes efficient use of all available data in both phases.","inCitations":["4e9bbbf590b23eb9a996edda64d8be7f0e9931f0","b44ca1d8c3ffb37ad65c2f80b2bbfa8c15876e46","f92f5ec14d15933a940a8786c8267846e6f35e48","174aac42523b70097046f92ec754dd54ae90a327","a081cef56dfdaa09101bf52f6a1de5a87ff5a659","0fd5870984c4dc34a85acf9ea24a18cd865d2c8d","cd463350dfa39a3dcd295dc0e3c80a64675d6c22"],"title":"Bayesian Semiparametric Analysis for Two-phase Studies of Gene-environment Interaction.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS599"}

We review the popular basic constructions. We then focus on an interesting extension of such models. In many applications covariates are available that could be used to a priori inform the clustering. This leads to random clustering models indexed by covariates, i.e., regression models with the outcome being a partition of the experimental units. We discuss some alternative approaches that have been used in the recent literature to implement such models, with an emphasis on a recently proposed extension of product partition models. Several of the reviewed approaches were not originally intended as covariate-based random partition models, but can be used for such inference.","inCitations":["6c60c2c082526afc0f76db5b73a14b1478e7ff3b","0952011dd79a1be03f49497e5d305a760c609b68","1af15b10dee8977fe85ccfc6e9d5b935cf4f8d03","ad17b99fcaa1310f4233c11c2a96b32f1a55afdf","c4c9bef53b37505e1676f3546d6ca7340eb6c8f5","88a529c0c1ddeb1d9d17760f8026d1b599f750ed","17a728adc32f6b1f2f65aea810fe0355fd7c5b60","28db5c883055aea6409a64b14c11614d056045d4","76de9f8fca83937a5a7e01231043c9b5b1d2e452","ec578f1ec1bb054155c3fe0a3f6decf2c093053f","dd5f4820aaac1819e729c243d1ebe9ed9ebc72f2","5aca0355d74eedbe08574be078ccd8f402f005e1","e11029a263bda6167607a49fd66e85d166ccd5b9","7c48b8b6b2805f13e5a38a293c76203f1a3ac629","36ebacc632e28d0b8bd5867ca61b84764a18f1f3","72cc610bcdaf4166839eeff04776adcea225439f","14ca7c5d3fafc3a20a76d2677b67ddb1e7ae1da1","99f6249353093d8f33a6e294f055165d09ac1b8e","f01319d2e568f4e6cfd4c79646d36c9f42b656ba","4c0725cc4a1748c1248ba9c72c23dc692a6e66a3","9f251df368f7b4f65b4c103cfb7bb827d8c36ebf","a2c9f8579557c2a33062eb6d4de7846bcbb6ff8b","55b3412671d9630e8a7828d9bd2a1705aaadcbd1","1a41270b9117640fdd7cdf132e73385223126e00","ab5252e26b16aedfea06932a95ad74840ddec347","b16357ab217534325ed816c15287952e461ff400","1bb662deceaf9fa941030987675cd98251b51a70","1f18f14f26c365a7cd14d0067870d664e1e7e9bf","5903a0e75d773c21ba09ffecc45fe5ef125fa8ae","49292d0e1b2033e0f6f113fb2f9fe8b86286b2fd","3455be11658f10111114c9771bb112e614225f66","49384ee45ca632eeb1fde40af085770b366bc19d","c7065d79a41b2b47f3275e3231d1804d75bcd7c1","51f2536683c5448bd219aeb93d23e9e51724e383"],"title":"Random Partition Models with Regression on Covariates.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2010.03.002"}

Tsodikov and Chefo (2008) developed a stable MLE approach to problems with independent observations, based on generalized self-consistency and quasi-EM algorithm developed in Tsodikov (2003). In this paper, we apply the idea to clustered multinomial response to simplify the maximization step. The method transforms the complex multinomial likelihood to Poisson-type likelihood and hence allows for the estimates to be obtained iteratively solving a set of independent low-dimensional problems. The methodology is applied to real data and studied by simulations. While maximization is simplified, numerical integration remains the dominant challenge to computational efficiency.","inCitations":["928e9fd8041e27ec225ce7adbb06387087cc19ea","964911c9f62585de9aefe51ed7ac57a63064b200","99dd6bad59d7dd13778531ac70baca2928616e3e","9e32ca761095ee5967b051a169abe8a26b1d0404","f2c75b1096964643066ada86f89ff299b4d33bd6","be6a12d086360ef7223a61c2ea9fba4610cf3725"],"title":"A Self-consistency Approach to Multinomial Logit Model with Random Effects.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2010.01.034"}

By means of five real RG examples, we examine how using different statistical methods to integrate coefficients alpha can influence results in RG studies. Specifically, we compare thirteen different statistical models for averaging reliability coefficients and searching for moderator variables that differ in terms of: (a) whether to transform or not the coefficients alpha, and (b) the statistical model assumed, distinguishing between ordinary least squares methods, the fixed-effect (FE) model, the varying coefficient (VC) model, and several versions of the random-effects (RE) model. The results obtained with the different methods exhibited important discrepancies, especially regarding moderator analyses. The main criterion for the model choice should be the extent to which the meta-analyst intends to generalize the results. RE models are the most appropriate when the meta-analyst aims to generalize to a hypothetical population of past or future studies, while FE and VC models are the most appropriate when the interest focuses on generalizing the results to a population of studies identical to those included in the meta-analysis. Finally, some guidelines are proposed for selecting the statistical model when conducting an RG study.","inCitations":["6c244d0ab98c44ff6763e6ee914996ca0104a167","96920f5c88cc22e37e95c85d2c44bd55ca2c32ae","b4fb5ca5acfb0073507f11753621b7e4976bc7e9","bbd98a5b85e6df16bc0ae9fa22a26fafc0e13d39","c856190a8de299ccc0c4b76192008fa9d93fe87a","c47d29cb8b87d68f1a35847c25ea3248f2828a98","70f5f57c87495391ed19764a99702d02ead5e0ab","f27cd42f87be1156be55824fdd7d342d816aff49","7fe2c0cde0c2c211dae34c50f1e2cc4d981082f0","b481c54675661f5fa289e12a4884fd0d6b33fbff","ecdb1148aefc08966c34699ecf844911d591d52b","302cf57f8b19fe88dfc5fc964e643cf4bfffdd85","5d41d6e0ff44c5e6f14863a63f4f774c3ab87676","392b1ecbd6183ac812e1c76a1ac6187f4bd7b459","8f090ccec1166119aa3ba08539e298f1019ad921"],"title":"Some recommended statistical analytic practices when reliability generalization studies are conducted.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02057.x"}

The parameters of the Weibull model are commonly obtained by maximum likelihood estimation; however, it is well-known that this estimator is not robust when dealing with contaminated data. A new robust procedure is introduced to fit a Weibull model by using L2 distance, i.e. integrated square distance, of the Weibull probability density function. The Weibull model is augmented with a weight parameter to robustly deal with contaminated data. Results comparing a maximum likelihood estimator with an L2 estimator are given in this article, based on both simulated and real data sets. It is shown that this new L2 parametric estimation method is more robust and does a better job than maximum likelihood in the newly proposed Weibull model when data are contaminated. The same preference for L2 distance criterion and the new Weibull model also happens for right-censored data with contamination.","inCitations":["fec2e781b0c468c07bec175a17e4e6cc124ea6e0","0c83de166c0c356deace5c6e8e787630a15c96de","db43d05a061ac96c435cacb790c4f6a7ddaeccb6"],"title":"Robust fitting of a Weibull model with optional censoring","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2013.05.009"}

Recently, Pardo-Fernández, Van Keilegom and González-Manteiga (2007) developed test statistics for simple nonparametric regression models: Y(ij) = θ(j)(Z(ij)) + σ(j)(Z(ij))∊(ij), based on empirical distributions of the errors in each population j = 1, … , J. In this paper, we propose a test for equality of the θ(j)(·) based on the concept of generalized likelihood ratio type statistics. We also generalize our test for other nonparametric regression setups, e.g, nonparametric logistic regression, where the loglikelihood for population j is any general smooth function [Formula: see text]. We describe a resampling procedure to obtain the critical values of the test. In addition, we present a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed test and compare our results to those in Pardo-Fernández et al. (2007).","inCitations":["08afe0d85061b888e6295758bc426f09374357cf","568bcb629e493cc95cf88114b0644c5cff397713","653e209d7a7b17f8f063d98c2d47f3f4c73b5643","68a81d4c3bca97c1add57b6e9d004260479ce369"],"title":"A Powerful Test for Comparing Multiple Regression Functions.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2012.677842"}
