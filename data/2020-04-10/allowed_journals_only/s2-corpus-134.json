The size will depend on the purpose of the study, the cost limitations, and the nature of the data. By specifying the standard deviation ratio and/or the sample size ratio, the present study considers the problem of heterogeneous variances and non-normality for Yuen's two-group test and develops sample size formulas to minimize the total cost or maximize the power of the test. For a given power, the sample size allocation ratio can be manipulated so that the proposed formulas can minimize the total cost, the total sample size, or the sum of total sample size and total cost. On the other hand, for a given total cost, the optimum sample size allocation ratio can maximize the statistical power of the test. After the sample size is determined, the present simulation applies Yuen's test to the sample generated, and then the procedure is validated in terms of Type I errors and power. Simulation results show that the proposed formulas can control Type I errors and achieve the desired power under the various conditions specified. Finally, the implications for determining sample sizes in experimental studies and future research are discussed.","inCitations":["71464586657391fb45d7afecddcb9441992f90f5","60792c35672cfef1bab10a61794a2519b9a6a5ca","51cdd1eb4da21e13274557ce3d282208dce51d5a","e6f74d2c6f697d1f50ecece52701a2fbeed1ad39","1750192688b7dcc30ec74ae454c9ae455f7468ee","1674761e757907449c243de982beb08d1ae676c3"],"title":"Optimum sample size allocation to minimize cost or maximize power for the two-sample trimmed mean test.","doi":"10.1348/000711007X267289"}

Proper modeling of multivariate taxon counts is essential to the power of detecting this association. Existing models are limited in handling excessive zero observations in taxon counts and in flexibly accommodating complex correlation structures and dispersion patterns among taxa. In this article, we develop a new probability distribution, zero-inflated generalized Dirichlet multinomial (ZIGDM), that overcomes these limitations in modeling multivariate taxon counts. Based on this distribution, we propose a ZIGDM regression model to link microbial abundances to covariates (e.g. disease status) and develop a fast expectation-maximization algorithm to efficiently estimate parameters in the model. The derived tests enable us to reveal rich patterns of variation in microbial compositions including differential mean and dispersion. The advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated through simulation studies and an analysis of a gut microbiome dataset.","inCitations":["bcb4efdaf254cf3e8bb2f36f7d399a4c5e46fb9a","ab32b5c35065a2361155c2d37da3536e95bff64b","e6233d4d725b098869f6a4de5eba317c19f55ad5","2c943c2db2e5914d7b636c79db7397736014227b","d8cf1febc1ef0c5eff6d4309faeaac24275ca1f5","bb1875b039d9a37a0113cf01bdd4ea957fb1c984","1f2c18241faffe0ebf0898d36483a5f7eb5f371a"],"title":"Zero-inflated generalized Dirichlet multinomial regression model for microbiome compositional data analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy025"}

We assume that the missing data are Missing at Random (MAR) or Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) throughout. Previous theoretical investigations in the literature have focused only on missing covariates or missing responses, but not both. Here, we consider theoretical properties of the estimates under three different estimation settings: complete case analysis (CC), a complete response analysis (CR) that involves an analysis of those subjects with only completely observed responses, and the all case analysis (AC), which is an analysis based on all of the cases. Under each scenario, we derive general expressions for the likelihood and devise estimation schemes based on the EM algorithm. We carry out a theoretical investigation of the three estimation methods in the normal linear model and analytically characterize the loss of information for each method, as well as derive and compare the asymptotic variances for each method assuming the missing data are MAR or MCAR. In addition, a theoretical investigation of bias for the CC method is also carried out.

The idea is to construct a 95% confidence interval for a proposed consistency index under a sampling plan. If the constructed 95% confidence lower limit is greater than a prespecified QC lower limit, then we claim that the raw material or final products have passed the QC and hence can be released for further processing or use; otherwise, the raw materials and/or final product should be rejected. For a given component (the most active component if possible), a sampling plan is derived to ensure that there is a desired probability for establishing consistency between sites when there is truly no difference in raw materials or final products between sites. An example concerning the development of a TCM is presented to illustrate the proposed statistical QC method for assessing consistency in raw materials from two sites.","inCitations":["8d4de350168a9aa4f17d74dda9bcd228a9ab5aaf","3c284f0dc47836d5881c5b62ebe69c2fa4eadbe9","5c776e69fef18a902eb858aa5701550490d9b53a","6e004592020844f0495a7f24681bcfae6b8c7a3d","a5d6ef322500f818385a5ac9c7cc03ea92da7c94","4bdba4b94c20e7b355a8aa76880ceccba3aebb5a","b3009f9a53a842e304b530480b2e8cca73c5cd5d","812a477385d204e9d390271e3d60e71513bc0b4b"],"title":"Statistical quality control process for traditional Chinese medicine.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600808047"}

The usual chi-square tests for event rate comparisons are inadequate to analyze such data since teeth within the same individual are correlated with one another. This situation may become further complicated when stratification adjustment is of interest, particularly when the stratification factor is also at the tooth or surface level, such as tooth type or presence of previous disease for the tooth. Consequently, statistical methods are needed to control for the correlation of sites in the mouth. A survey sampling approach is suggested; with this method, the sample is managed as a one stage cluster sample of patients to obtain the design base covariance matrix for the cell counts in a contingency table. The covariance matrix for the cell counts can be obtained from statistical software used to analyze data from large sample surveys. Approximate estimates for variance for various measures of association can then be obtained by Taylor series methods. Event rate comparisons through the odds ratio, relative risk, risk difference as well as other measures of association can be made with adjustments for the intra-patient correlation. Methods for summary measures of association across strata are considered as well.","inCitations":["32a5c53c56c23f3ca0aa79ddaff61c20d324184b","1b1dd59ad486b0a39595e4ebdb1e4f78b18676aa"],"title":"Statistical strategies for event rate comparisons in dental studies.","doi":"10.1080/10543409708835212"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"In the U.S., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services uses 30-day readmission, following hospitalization, as a proxy outcome to monitor quality of care. These efforts generally focus on treatable health conditions, such as pneumonia and heart failure. Expanding quality of care systems to monitor conditions for which treatment options are limited or non-existent, such as pancreatic cancer, is challenging because of the non-trivial force of mortality; 30-day mortality for pancreatic cancer is approximately 30%. In the statistical literature, data that arise when the observation of the time to some non-terminal event is subject to some terminal event are referred to as 'semi-competing risks data'. Given such data, scientific interest may lie in at least one of three areas: (i) estimation/inference for regression parameters, (ii) characterization of dependence between the two events, and (iii) prediction given a covariate profile. Existing statistical methods focus almost exclusively on the first of these; methods are sparse or non-existent, however, when interest lies with understanding dependence and performing prediction. In this paper we propose a Bayesian semi-parametric regression framework for analyzing semi-competing risks data that permits the simultaneous investigation of all three of the aforementioned scientific goals. Characterization of the induced posterior and posterior predictive distributions is achieved via an efficient Metropolis-Hastings-Green algorithm, which has been implemented in an R package. The proposed framework is applied to data on 16,051 individuals diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 2005-2008, obtained from Medicare Part A. We found that increased risk for readmission is associated with a high comorbidity index, a long hospital stay at initial hospitalization, non-white race, male, and discharge to home care.","inCitations":["4afdb1d14e79aec0c5766dfd19c31f2b78243150","8c8bb8610370cb9ba2504664a6041c8747df5a0f","66d6ac1c0b934cea98a4c14b137ce5c1c54aa8fa","252ab6006a0bf8436370942898d8c447cc179953","7c212d10c1f7fc723b7661a753876db5976354b7","e9dc2d53aebb5821c90cae42414e9fc9bb2612c8","e5059afd88102d8431f6734d55de070fe3f57b8f","2aa8881d5899627e5fcc64f8ccf0551a691f787b","32204c2eb069ec37971a29f047967d9fc15922b7","85f8bdc5d10a7fa43f568c2412b8534811c10350","e21c2918e6cac0615a1a59aaa772fea96134cf55","932896a476f33838412187dbdc2c98763a06be18","85691196fa3f577847cc04cfcd2e508f364ef3ce","4326eabbf42ef8ed9ccfc04e6df3058ea1618fab","87a5c34a1882815073940505ed9e97762e008ee3","063e616507f3b63dcdad5b6840ce50899f26568c","686e3438296a03321d56cdb0e3212ffbe4174f0c","898392324563169d97e9fc1dd33db35e08694c56","41a2f682a81cb49386877a2112ceeada0886e943"],"title":"Bayesian Semi-parametric Analysis of Semi-competing Risks Data: Investigating Hospital Readmission after a Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12078"}

Niche-based theories have emphasized the important role played by competition for maintaining species diversity. Many of these insights have been derived using MacArthur's consumer resource model (MCRM) or its generalizations. Most theoretical work on the MCRM has focused on small ecosystems with a few species and resources. However theoretical insights derived from small ecosystems many not scale up large ecosystems with many resources and species because large systems with many interacting components often display new emergent behaviors that cannot be understood or deduced from analyzing smaller systems. To address these shortcomings, we develop a statistical physics inspired cavity method to analyze MCRM when both the number of species and the number of resources is large. Unlike previous work in this limit, our theory addresses resource dynamics and resource depletion and demonstrates that species generically and consistently perturb their environments and significantly modify available ecological niches. We show how our cavity approach naturally generalizes niche theory to large ecosystems by accounting for the effect of collective phenomena on species invasion and ecological stability. Our theory suggests that such phenomena are a generic feature of large, natural ecosystems and must be taken into account when analyzing and interpreting community structure. It also highlights the important role that statistical-physics inspired approaches can play in furthering our understanding of ecology.","inCitations":["15d3b5f1dd8c1d6ed0fcf948ebe39bf009789c62","d7812f099d1e8a0f42d240dfae022ac37fe8c8bb","6627a1eec7048fffbc7c948b5fda6f6cb0827313","0a45bb97b37cd03b8c2b56e4b5d9514abddb9623","9bd63b8c5aaeabbe52c8729420ca7b651484dae8","b8a8156897a92451c44b7863481f9dd8ff295863","0e1caf8166468c7c5323e4e44c48fb62cacd8fa8","28a9d370fc9c3b362afdf3715399ba84aa69396d","6df61926a4938f88321cfd6560a944c9b8b8f81f"],"title":"Statistical physics of community ecology: a cavity solution to MacArthur's consumer resource model.","doi":"10.1088/1742-5468/aab04e"}

Transfer learning aims to integrate data of the new domain with knowledge about some related old domains, in order to model the new domain better. This paper studies transfer learning for degenerate biological systems. Degeneracy refers to the phenomenon that structurally different elements of the system perform the same/similar function or yield the same/similar output. Degeneracy exits in various biological systems and contributes to the heterogeneity, complexity, and robustness of the systems. Modeling of degenerate biological systems is challenging and models enabling transfer learning in such systems have been little studied. In this paper, we propose a predictive model that integrates transfer learning and degeneracy under a Bayesian framework. Theoretical properties of the proposed model are studied. Finally, we present an application of modeling the predictive relationship between transcription factors and gene expression across multiple cell lines. The model achieves good prediction accuracy, and identifies known and possibly new degenerate mechanisms of the system.","inCitations":["ba5714f0feef78c1b828a7f714876980f8fd2905","d00b66aab67fb95de6cb1d46a2e6de47550a1e32","01ca370f7e8a63042be54b771734df552cb06d28","debef9cb03c40e27245e775f3a6486b347c80bd4","c8641c2d8c4cf6ddf0d1804594ad0ec90c45821e","2aabfe0784d5b3588476731ad2c51edfa5b9c1bc","fcf9d804901ae4901cd3f9dd527d154d0f8185ff"],"title":"A Transfer Learning Approach for Predictive Modeling of Degenerate Biological Systems","doi":"10.1080/00401706.2015.1044117"}

When the underlying genetic model for the disease is known, the CATT optimal for the genetic model is used. For complex diseases, however, the genetic models of the true disease loci are unknown. In this situation, robust tests are preferable. We propose a two-phase analysis with model selection for the case-control design. In the first phase, we use the difference of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium coefficients between the cases and the controls for model selection. Then, an optimal CATT corresponding to the selected model is used for testing association. The correlation of the statistics used for selection and the test for association is derived to adjust the two-phase analysis with control of the Type-I error rate. The simulation studies show that this new approach has greater efficiency robustness than the existing methods.","inCitations":["f019a446aca39c3cc3f066ec90f6f4919437ce44","8171d65b02d0871c0f60fae54e5780e9f9b3e40f","23640e7724aa450102c5cef3dc7252f6b474ec51","7b8f4bb8bdd294e8c7ebc237361f48b2d1878147","0d6c59157253120be12bb10f3c4b38d48123b534","558cbcc63deebeea095e6123a5a7ba1738d391d8","27d2b4e3f7e09414e40a81882c8c690a1f259c4d","9f9bd7cbf991b426154792974b277ba227b03c26","9df0b398b1252e28b9e6f707d5a6217dbc16bcf3","59325bd200823130c65d6a07265ac80214fdc688","b94b1e246eb39ff001d76e8ade073c37884937e3","0c601a86a815829d0be361251b45da989cada829","f92ecefe0779369f537fac2e27feafca93663d51","401b78dafb2c31972cfbbfc4ae3726e31acaa290","ba71234144b90e6e205da0058b3e72cdaab754b4","52a09b0220f100c96636683a626a1a4b0f2ae6ab","cb1d32dd9402a35fda1f57cca94089e12bb16864","77e7a9618a63ee1e84c90ec063b0fbbf7b1fa8b8","2a2df64ee6a34a4c2d141645e44d5541e256af84","590b0b7c582b3ff52f03c0090e01904bf3a46904","629529c9109c0b53f27d12baafa2dfecc4f4ff29","3f67a45a1e699e885f96f12af354ad4e865aa578","3ddfe5f14c7431a98172a39218504cdc20e87c05","4f51ad9e71f2d41fcec63d2ca3a8ba1eda0dc990","92731814cb46516bbd799a1928eff03cd1db3a55","c25b9800b59ba69a7755e2d74ada38310f4d3ffc","608d1bd5bf8d4389733766f3d6b773284c0b7969","2cd51419174e9666d77e9b427bbaf68d7298c5f1","8e1b7d6199ccfadd6bd05dbd1a8cd512a3a7b1d5","4e0338900ea8e0b3bbf9a87d5e7a8ad02582f36d","ec1a77b873191f42081fbc043566c15361483364","96ee7b8a6b8c035b3df84655f32851db07a4497d","d77b73e2304b597d26348c1b483e9f55da12385d","60c787d2c86457d996c441d52c04954c31ef6010","020288914fb9768f890cb383d53d172cd3fa315f","bbc67103a98a5738a394eeaa35b2de521d2b89a2","658ff3c96278ae9ab21707acd2625105458040d3","a37f516c6a94ce422d7d765fecbcab267ec767bf","521f111224ae9225d212d5834e15ea02d7a3ec3e","e3944a35f300fba73463016d0b1d4c658b55508b","572571bbd70884fc619ed06b6f04578f7a4266ea","9ed1c5bb0efcd36de0374ccab048796ed307d278","4ae13eb908641a537502660ef218c0aff9d15093","e27cd64e37fcd36ce226741d8ef08a4c1f3beaf6","4c4c97b5450a8c4f8e1d586fbfac342f2ae51ec5"],"title":"Genetic model selection in two-phase analysis for case-control association studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm039"}

Alternatively, we propose a test based on the concept of the extension of the modified large sample method to compare inter-subject variability and total variability between treatments under a 2 x 2 m replicated crossover design. An asymptotic power of the proposed test is derived. A sensitivity analysis is performed based on the asymptotic power to determine how the power changes with respect to various parameters such as inter-subject correlation and intra-class correlation. Also the two methods for sample size calculation for testing total variability under 2 x 4 crossover design are discussed. The method based on the Fisher-Cornish inversion shows better performance than the method based on the normal approximation. Several simulation studies were conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed test.

For example, the identification of DE genes between distinct disease phenotypes is an important first step in understanding and developing treatment drugs for the disease. We present a novel approach to the problem of detecting DE genes that is based on a test statistic formed as a weighted (normalized) cluster-specific contrast in the mixed effects of the mixture model used in the first instance to cluster the gene profiles into a manageable number of clusters. The key factor in the formation of our test statistic is the use of gene-specific mixed effects in the cluster-specific contrast. It thus means that the (soft) assignment of a given gene to a cluster is not crucial. This is because in addition to class differences between the (estimated) fixed effects terms for a cluster, gene-specific class differences also contribute to the cluster-specific contributions to the final form of the test statistic. The proposed test statistic can be used where the primary aim is to rank the genes in order of evidence against the null hypothesis of no DE. We also show how a P-value can be calculated for each gene for use in multiple hypothesis testing where the intent is to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at some desired level. With the use of publicly available and simulated datasets, we show that the proposed contrast-based approach outperforms other methods commonly used for the detection of DE genes both in a ranking context with lower proportion of false discoveries and in a multiple hypothesis testing context with higher power for a specified level of the FDR.","inCitations":["f517793f25e010e5c45d9d77e5752cd23b5dc723","3dda029ab40c349ef111a408b865c82cf93e8789","10c36de3101969809171fc02e3c535186a4812a7"],"title":"Inference on differences between classes using cluster-specific contrasts of mixed effects.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu028"}

It introduces a class of continuous time models which incorporates two forms of simultaneity across related processes--when the hazard rate of one process depends (1) on the hazard rate of another process or (2) on the actual current state of or prior outcomes of a related multi-episode process. This paper also develops an approach to modeling the notion of 'multiple clocks' in which one process may depend on the duration of a related process, in addition to its own.

Although this process gives rise to clustered or correlated test outcomes, the associated inference issues are well recognized and have been widely discussed in the literature. In mental health and psychosocial research, sensitivity and specificity have also been widely used to study the reliability of instrument for diagnosing mental health and psychiatric conditions and assessing certain behavioral patterns. However, unlike biomedical applications, outcomes are often obtained under varying reference standards or different diagnostic criteria, precluding the application of existing methods for comparing multiple diagnostic tests to such a research setting. In this paper, we develop a new approach to address these problems (including that of missing data) by extending recent work on inference using inverse probability weighted estimates. The approach is illustrated with data from two studies in sexual abuse and health research as well as a limited simulation study, with the latter used to study the performance of the proposed procedure.","inCitations":["418563597d40b29ad3b6c37a2e377aa9538abc79"],"title":"Comparing multiple sensitivities and specificities with different diagnostic criteria: Applications to sexual abuse and sexual health research","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.05.031"}

An example for such a setting is voting records of legislators on different issues, such as defense, energy, and healthcare. We develop a Markov graphical model to characterize the heterogeneous dependence structures arising from such data. The model is fitted via a joint estimation method that preserves the underlying common graph structure, but also allows for differences between the networks. The method employs a group penalty that targets the common zero interaction effects across all the networks. We apply the method to describe the internal networks of the U.S. Senate on several important issues. Our analysis reveals individual structure for each issue, distinct from the underlying well-known bipartisan structure common to all categories which we are able to extract separately. We also establish consistency of the proposed method both for parameter estimation and model selection, and evaluate its numerical performance on a number of simulated examples.","inCitations":["34d35bd3c0d430bac325db787d37194558f86307","e7f7fbd24f59d7353d78778bc3dce08536edba27","37e5b61f71d67838f7140e63714ceb5792117e94","9fb71107492080f4396293a0cabf24b4db7a8e13","096ad39e08c3f26bb9038c1b4fcd544411103fac","e53ef762bd887def2750aec863cf88e1d75a9a73","0515b0fefd2565b19b5c233488baa8c184539d82","3de341622b1d66306e4d217310deb333159573c1","e60b262e9598963c44d0bdf0a859d06f51dec953","b93089cd0820b3bf905305bf7d75cb90264780a5","cc8f686bcc6481f0aee6507999ae79d82d18d09e","1ba48f0abb41600e78066a2980ce05ea0c0c9d44","367669fd7ceae8dafb22ae37be7b8b0a6b8a1e55","da8b1d4af435402aa5651f6c0f8d604d8b7ec400","ce6dadb725b0d72e366cef80782951af0ede3633","8886203ca29c4260951d1275a1490bc4bb07d4af"],"title":"Estimating Heterogeneous Graphical Models for Discrete Data with an Application to Roll Call Voting.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS700"}

Novel measures are derived for assessing both absolute and relative impacts of mixed-mode variables in latent class analysis. Specifically, the expected posterior gradient and the Kolmogorov variation of the posterior distribution, as well as related properties are studied.

After spinal cord injury, muscle activation patterns can affect locomotor recovery. We present a novel application of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to estimate activation patterns from electromyographic data. We assume the data to be a zero-mean, heteroscedastic process. The variance is explicitly modeled using a step function. The number and location of points of discontinuity, or change-points, in the step function, the inter-change-point variances, and the overall mean are jointly modeled along with the mean and variance from baseline data. The number of change-points is considered a nuisance parameter and is integrated out of the posterior distribution. Whereas current methods of detecting activation patterns are deterministic or provide only point estimates, ours provides distributional estimates of muscle activation. These estimates, in turn, are used to estimate physiologically relevant quantities such as muscle coactivity, total integrated energy, and average burst duration and to draw valid statistical inferences about these quantities.","inCitations":["584502e756f2c5fd68d64468c49e257859a04723","3dd873c27e29df2ae57515a674c68d5d36cbccda","90a2c5cca02607d4d6469e03fa3d5562fbd0e4bf","13dd506e224761c33456e21154b596f69177662c","2aaf4ad5a748acfec110e5eb431cd1eccfbce303","245d01fb8c37e6662e521ad19cc3cc96798e96bb","89211b91c780b47e9d92aa2c28d97975ffb22604","073ccf3d31814a629f5be7d37ab10ac9b5375340","5fe9451593780ebdd9261f9dcdaa3aa673d2bceb","089dad672559872c44fca8505a7f6613415249d1","e55f1e314daa810070bd8c5b2a02a45a48b39ba8","2370bd4f7a8dec72c0182756514c7c3c11def687","688581bc42b30458f8ac951ea31d6fe5e4df164a","e4a8ce45c3209f678c9608728d76b84fee366a11","f02d3a231e43da1eec70677393c50f858face825","afdf2f0a98dec2bac470929da406b9b53051b4fc","23c140cfeb2bceafc8c5af1d9f2ad137246b4749","6566b73a65443c2169ade4f6f084fa154874f85d","203744a1191ea57405f87636b9997a2910db4931","e547d520522aadbc76305c7dc7d446cf8a396f4c","d347fadf62385cd6c29e9cc965e9578360762ff6","014b7147e2d7716c585683e58429e4f75a2122a9","9a8f6d3ee135eed2639563b23bf656ad5e270053","3334859dd1162cdb93e5368a897176f94832cc64","55b91e40caf80a60e1c8d8ad09ccb1829eddea8f","c1f360a7b1df20f55e8ff857ae6ab1477a920e3f","408e78f0bad51022cc9fbedc6e66cf6ab5192010","d9ed10536094af149b32f98b4b554c70b2d5f285"],"title":"A Bayesian change-point analysis of electromyographic data: detecting muscle activation patterns and associated applications.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.1.143"}

The stepwise approach starts with the assessment of critical quality attributes (CQAs) that are relevant to clinical outcomes in structural and functional characterization in the manufacturing process of the proposed biosimilar product. FDA suggests that these critical quality relevant attributes be identified and classified into three tiers depending on their criticality or risk ranking. To assist the sponsors, FDA also suggests some statistical approaches for the assessment of analytical similarity for CQAs from different tiers, namely equivalence test for Tier 1, quality range approach for Tier 2, and descriptive raw data and graphical comparison for Tier 3. Analytical similarity assessment for CQAs in Tier 1 is performed based on the equivalence acceptance criterion (EAC), which depends upon the estimate of variability of the reference product. The FDA's recommended approach often underestimates the variability of the reference product because it does not take the worst possible lots into consideration. In this article, we examine the statistical properties of the FDA's recommended approach and proposed alternative methods in establishing an alternative approach under the scenario where multiple samples drew from each lot.","inCitations":["00b17200b92771aaa132d2d95165e3e8552e9ba3","a64ca865463c166369b955eb6eaee26f79541c00"],"title":"On the establishment of equivalence acceptance criterion in analytical similarity assessment.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1265539"}

In addition, when longitudinal data is incomplete, incorrectly modelling the correlation matrix often results in bias in estimating mean regression parameters. In this paper, we introduce a flexible and parsimonious class of regression models for a covariance matrix parameterized using marginal variances and partial autocorrelations. The partial autocorrelations can freely vary in the interval (-1, 1) while maintaining positive definiteness of the correlation matrix so the regression parameters in these models will have no constraints. We propose a class of priors for the regression coefficients and examine the importance of correctly modeling the correlation structure on estimation of longitudinal (mean) trajectories and the performance of the DIC in choosing the correct correlation model via simulations. The regression approach is illustrated on data from a longitudinal clinical trial.","inCitations":["cdb043359773b3e59e12bfd4424edd3743c7343c","f514d4ccfdfea9c3ee77b353d54ed72a2ffe13eb","b4313d90d8b568f7813ec1e21b3224d131a2a33d","276106d3667e5d4aa09f438cc3a7f2bad678364e","f5c7db5c64f88a843844b0821032543916545af4"],"title":"Bayesian modeling of the dependence in longitudinal data via partial autocorrelations and marginal variances","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2012.11.010"}

One promising model is the separable temporal exponential-family random graph model (ERGM) of Krivitsky and Handcock, which treats the formation and dissolution of ties in parallel at each time step as independent ERGMs. However, the computational cost of fitting these models can be substantial, particularly for large, sparse networks. Fitting cross-sectional models for observations of a network at a single point in time, while still a non-negligible computational burden, is much easier. This paper examines model fitting when the available data consist of independent measures of cross-sectional network structure and the duration of relationships under the assumption of stationarity. We introduce a simple approximation to the dynamic parameters for sparse networks with relationships of moderate or long duration and show that the approximation method works best in precisely those cases where parameter estimation is most likely to fail-networks with very little change at each time step. We consider a variety of cases: Bernoulli formation and dissolution of ties, independent-tie formation and Bernoulli dissolution, independent-tie formation and dissolution, and dependent-tie formation models.","inCitations":["e970df7b849b9478f2f55c4f9057333be3fd4f57","e7287e5873c8958cc009837bf84fb7b2f2cfd942","af802de0575a4470f600a4c0dc5281f187bc90f3","84ebce7fe915d0e2ab3a4500db496aab4e17a506","0495d5587e559420425c96e5d1197ece8c6f8de1"],"title":"An approximation method for improving dynamic network model fitting.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2014.903087"}
