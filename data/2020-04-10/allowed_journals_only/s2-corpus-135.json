In personality assessment, for example, constructs are mostly theoretically defined as unidimensional, yet responses collected from the real world are almost always determined by multiple factors. Significant research efforts have concentrated on the use of simulated studies to evaluate the robustness of unidimensional item response models when applied to multidimensional data with a dominant dimension. In contrast, in the present paper, I report the result from a theoretical investigation that a multidimensional item response model is empirically indistinguishable from a locally dependent unidimensional model, of which the single dimension represents the actual construct of interest. A practical implication of this result is that multidimensional response data do not automatically require the use of multidimensional models. Circumstances under which the alternative approach of locally dependent unidimensional models may be useful are discussed.","inCitations":["4f3becbc1bd93953bc1eac209c8662ef413a0e29","53f9fd4dbfdb4bb1053054c18b0d7d4f313115cf","aff372def4c16597f1c43bd02d1a8fd266e86978","eccd604d37980a94f078b5ae7862ab89f25ec33f","f6fab2ca1656e5ebc0727995af7bd5d0efab02cb","f5e4f75eff8fce2aa328180d66fac76b523ef25a","123cbc578f5d037caefe23b4ef0c42146650f416","ab394420ce51fa71c93407cfbf3eb4ec70c90cc4","6ca46a077580c16316393749d473efe48a277bf3","e54fd1737715b3f26e1b95dbb031278112b53bbf","dc5c83f4c9e9f487d0abbb88b06a36833d21dbb3","b6cde66fd170f6cfcd47825d883158365a007bd0","df601381175122f7db708a76294b009a3f043655","021f5ecbb1db296452a591377096ee83bca07067","3ae499aebdc58338bb3bad008d89b9f97ba5c10d","a413d83e9c2b758c866e2b1e6ea3d62a315c5d0c","0b861a5e3414f691488361a0016baa30878b851e","ccbe3919abc3ac67adb62f025a8ef822c9f82e2b","9c6d23a369d15b985c49f8fc838553da925978ac","8d5771cd61b66b4e0749b4e58c0c1eeff6226082","2fbb73e0b13416a91534b5111daa1cbe2e939c58","c7e4e178ef6bd7cbcf3c3a8446e2c9c567fd1718","55a492347a2650363b7be03ee4a0b861041a92e5","6ae6b05231a6572a9d4e79cce592f4b4cce16975","86ad62a3b8a2fe99023a320f27774bdc5d241a6c","ae7b03d6b7d4be220dd19ab9ffa733581a0b796e","c1a034c4009dfd7666bbdfc05a979189a617257e","d8d43a89b60861ffb0c3c78916fbc42c818a8b2f"],"title":"Empirically indistinguishable multidimensional IRT and locally dependent unidimensional item response models.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X466835"}

An approximate degrees of freedom (ADF) composite procedure based on trimmed/Winsorized estimators and a non-pooled estimate of error variance is proposed, and compared to a composite procedure based on trimmed/Winsorized estimators and a pooled estimate of error variance. The step-down procedures were also compared to Hotelling's T (2) and Johansen's ADF global procedure based on trimmed estimators in a simulation study. Type I error rates of the pooled step-down procedure were sensitive to covariance heterogeneity in unbalanced designs; error rates were similar to those of Hotelling's T (2) across all of the investigated conditions. Type I error rates of the ADF composite step-down procedure were insensitive to covariance heterogeneity and less sensitive to the number of dependent variables when sample size was small than error rates of Johansen's test. The ADF composite step-down procedure is recommended for testing hypotheses of mean equality in two-group designs except when the data are sampled from populations with different degrees of multivariate skewness.","inCitations":["7e18f8641194da09c397fc3310fc1a418d1f23f1","7efc3bbbd1db72201a7e18e3ff5c24f39a413a53","e9e0742f4e92ea075f361d8c55526324b3a0ab04","4c604ab80bd33e5d98f8698f992c8d675b827e52","c186f50b721e3328ca7d65d379bdabe2508c640c"],"title":"Robust step-down tests for multivariate independent group designs.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X117853"}

A longitudinal series of measurements is collected on each subject within each period. However, much of the dependence among such observations, within and between periods, is generally ignored in analyzing this type of data. Usually, only a random coefficient model is fitted for the parameters in the nonlinear mean function, along with allowing the variance to depend on the mean so that it changes over time. Here, we develop models to allow more fully for the structure of the crossover study. We introduce two levels of variance components, for the subjects and for the periods within subjects, and also an autocorrelation within periods. We also retain the time-varying variance, using a separate variance function for this, different from that for the mean. We apply this model to a phase I study of the drug flosequinan and its metabolite. This drug was developed for the treatment of heart failure. Because the metabolite also exhibits an active pharmacologic effect, study of both the parent drug and the metabolite is of interest. We find that the autocorrelation is the element in the covariance structure that most improves the fit of the model but that two levels of variance components can also be necessary.","inCitations":["d49f9ec8be916bb04b12e5a30924cd7ae62bb843","a27be166094dc252940f5d2e8bc5af0a30b99b65","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","d5f52734bf9c54c21636d0736825057ccfc625ae"],"title":"Modeling the covariance structure in pharmacokinetic crossover trials.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101186"}

Joint Bayesian estimates of the thresholds, the factor scores and the structural parameters subjected to some simple constraints across groups are obtained simultaneously. The Gibbs sampler is used to produce the joint Bayesian estimates. It is shown that the conditional distributions involved in the implementation are the familiar uniform, gamma, normal, univariate truncated normal and Wishart distributions. The Bayes factor is introduced to test hypotheses involving constraints among the structural parameters of the factor analysis models across groups. Two procedures for computing the test statistics are developed, one based on the Schwarz criterion (or Bayesian information criterion), while the other computes the posterior densities and likelihood ratios by means of draws from the appropriate conditional distributions via the Gibbs sampler. The empirical performance of the proposed Bayesian procedure and its sensitivity to prior distributions are illustrated by some simulation results and two real-life examples.","inCitations":["66e77455649e84476c48ec3bcac1e560677dd5d7","269f11d9d6d380466168599abe7c0ad5e8292942","7bbfc6050a24dce49454a56d9af2ad2e6fc40ad2","5a9785aceed5ce8bf2997af31ce5756b7ca94a8a","214dc6242695868ebc2e56999b8a350de889639d","0c0d6522f69fc21887dd0ca7e09e5175aa7d7c8b","5012109cdf985a5c8b8e72914e00fc4596dc19b3","320649cb417cadc0ede81472bf728ba968779a77","37cb9b93175720bb253a389dcdd3b6f5a394b736","1ef9d441b0df554d730bd6a92047eeb9a2caf92c","a328faf454bec0ad841aed0084ce8ce475b75d46","c11bd6aa99d375a469fc94f237cc279e2a61c8e8","94fe2bb79c76c8200cceb33fdcf57d57ada80ba0","a0d6cd1d5ee8275ec9bef947511bf13d4bc3b1e0","d3e477f59b5f50f9fd58745834dc44f2549ffcb2","cd11d8c7145481e3b6bdfbba5d13abd8ca9dd091","6ee9a736f93a01813949715008f078229aa24335","862759e8fab45f04cc8f8297aad5c749df89bb5c","07bfff26ff5ed410d353f7a26022cca65fc56b9d","a60bfeeaabb7f54d2a1b00ef19aa4979691b2d79","183acb4fe7c077db47828bfe04dea1cd9b9768b5","822391a297b7baeb3aa5e194e1daaff93899f553","f74b85742828f311a629133d9c0cf0724be96547","0ba6225ded8e568576c40e0798f899e1067a7187","ee6c0d96339a8dab48be3375bba29cc2655de611","704743378f06452384a994b4d5318013d4157365","c4af34314a477ce1956348b8603ad489cbceaa26","53d5fbd246388ba18afa764a5db815a437145214","a5ecf97b9cf48d83b8fe629d9f7b75b365c5734b","088dd19b3e6528dd014cff7d0fd5cc3443c65377","f834666d6b1ce39cfd6236413c1305ed3112239c","1e728f84d0cf510ea582b15cf96574529413c38d","7d6f224d43548700a2a2915d43d270a6fac889a7","06250ecfa8dd0976c7230fae798ae33b8fa5d246","851948c91bc26e0a8027801fd4947068a2de083b"],"title":"Bayesian estimation and test for factor analysis model with continuous and polytomous data in several populations.","doi":"10.1348/000711001159546"}

Methods for comparing alternative measures of dispersion have been derived that perform well in simulations, but all methods for comparing variances have been found to be unsatisfactory in terms of Type I error probabilities or power. Currently, it appears that the most successful method, in terms of controlling the probability of a Type I error, is based on the so-called mean half-square successive difference statistic where a bootstrap is used to estimate its standard error, and a calibrated bootstrap is used to control the probability of a Type I error.

A slight modification of the percentile bootstrap method for computing a 1 - alpha confidence interval for the difference between the variances is considered that corrects these problems.","inCitations":["283c8e30253edc2c973a5c41048f7f41cf319eae","b6163f8505f57995d7b1e3341ccbec2437f2b100","5da6083c90c30025d5d510ded95f0fa1a8f0a73d","f3789c68106bc4d1aa879660a04ea6e3813e4be8","915c06ac0fe45921c06fc7ca3e3ed182f1d5b227","aa2d71f1feea36e38db4e707eafab66702a0f7c2","117f3613a5028bd7ca941627b005197ee82c5b16"],"title":"Comparing the variances of two independent groups.","doi":"10.1348/000711002159635"}

A power transformation (PT) is applied to refine the randomization probability. The clip method is used to bound the randomization probability within specified limits. A burn-in period of equal randomization (ER) can be added before adaptive randomization (AR). For each method, more patients are assigned to the superior arm and overall response rate increase as the scheme approximates simple AR, while statistical power increases as it approximates ER. We evaluate the performance of the three methods by varying the tuning parameter to control the extent of AR to achieve the same statistical power. When there is no early stopping rule, PT method generally performed the best in yielding higher proportion to the superior arm and higher overall response rate, but with larger variability. The burn-in method showed smallest variability compared with the clip method and the PT method. With the efficacy early stopping rule, all three methods performed more similarly. The PT and clip methods are better than the burn-in method in achieving higher proportion randomized to the superior arm and higher overall response rate but burn-in method required fewer patients in the trial. By carefully choosing the method and the tuning parameter, RAR methods can be tailored to strike a balance between achieving the desired statistical power and enhancing the overall response rate.","inCitations":["4d9828c6113e5861f39783dffb04658939b01524"],"title":"Comparing three regularization methods to avoid extreme allocation probability in response-adaptive randomization.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1293077"}

The family of the considered models is specified using only second-moments assumptions, where the variance of the count response has the form μ+ϕμp $\\mu + \\phi \\mu^p$, where µ is the expectation, ϕ and p are the dispersion and power parameters, respectively. Parameter estimations are carried out using an estimating function approach obtained by combining the quasi-score and Pearson estimating functions. The performance of the fitting algorithm is investigated through simulation studies. The results showed that our estimating function approach provides consistent estimators for both mean and dispersion parameters. The class of models is motivated by a data set concerning CD4 counting in HIV-positive pregnant women assisted in a public hospital in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil. Specifically, we investigate the effects of a set of covariates in both expectation and dispersion structures. Our results showed that women living out of the capital Curitiba, with viral load equal or larger than 1000 copies and with previous diagnostic of HIV infection, present lower levels of CD4 cell count. Furthermore, we detected that the time to initiate the antiretroviral therapy decreases the data dispersion. The data set and R code are available as supplementary materials.","inCitations":["114d2fc263fd81f8846756bf8e048a02e0c063a9","a0d1f581e004876a63327b0f459d880608baa3b6"],"title":"Double Poisson-Tweedie Regression Models","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2018-0119"}

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests in particular can detect the presence of an infection, of drugs, or hormones (as in the home pregnancy test). Inference of an unknown concentration via ELISA usually involves a non-linear heteroscedastic regression and subsequent prediction, which can be carried out in a Bayesian framework. For such a Bayesian inference, we are developing informative prior distributions based on extensive historical ELISA tests as well as theoretical considerations. One consideration regards the quality of the immunoassay leading to two practical requirements for the applicability of the priors. Simulations show that the additional prior information can lead to inferences which are robust to reasonable perturbations of the model and changes in the design of the data. On real data, the applicability is demonstrated across different laboratories, for different analytes and laboratory equipment as well as for previous and current ELISAs with sigmoid regression function. Consistency checks on real data (similar to cross-validation) underpin the adequacy of the suggested priors. Altogether, the new priors may improve concentration estimation for ELISAs that fulfill certain design conditions, by extending the range of the analyses, decreasing the uncertainty, or giving more robust estimates. Future use of these priors is straightforward because explicit, closed-form expressions are provided. This work encourages development and application of informative, yet general, prior distributions for other types of immunoassays.","inCitations":["8973da334758e410314e83c7f8a203bc6035e3d2"],"title":"Informative prior distributions for ELISA analyses.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu057"}

Suppose that one is concerned with estimation of a particular pathwise differentiable Euclidean parameter. A substitution estimator evaluating the parameter of a given likelihood based density estimator is typically too biased and might not even converge at the parametric rate: that is, the density estimator was targeted to be a good estimator of the density and might therefore result in a poor estimator of a particular smooth functional of the density. In this article we propose a one step (and, by iteration, k-th step) targeted maximum likelihood density estimator which involves 1) creating a hardest parametric submodel with parameter epsilon through the given density estimator with score equal to the efficient influence curve of the pathwise differentiable parameter at the density estimator, 2) estimating epsilon with the maximum likelihood estimator, and 3) defining a new density estimator as the corresponding update of the original density estimator. We show that iteration of this algorithm results in a targeted maximum likelihood density estimator which solves the efficient influence curve estimating equation and thereby yields a locally efficient estimator of the parameter of interest, under regularity conditions. In particular, we show that, if the parameter is linear and the model is convex, then the targeted maximum likelihood estimator is often achieved in the first step, and it results in a locally efficient estimator at an arbitrary (e.g., heavily misspecified) starting density.We also show that the targeted maximum likelihood estimators are now in full agreement with the locally efficient estimating function methodology as presented in Robins and Rotnitzky (1992) and van der Laan and Robins (2003), creating, in particular, algebraic equivalence between the double robust locally efficient estimators using the targeted maximum likelihood estimators as an estimate of its nuisance parameters, and targeted maximum likelihood estimators. In addition, it is argued that the targeted MLE has various advantages relative to the current estimating function based approach. We proceed by providing data driven methodologies to select the initial density estimator for the targeted MLE, thereby providing data adaptive targeted maximum likelihood estimation methodology.

An important class of adaptive designs is adaptive randomization, which is considered very briefly in subsection VI.B of the guidance. The objective of this paper is to review several important new classes of adaptive randomization procedures and convey information on the recent developments in the literature on this topic. Much of this literature has been focused on the development of methodology to address past criticisms and concerns that have hindered the broader use of adaptive randomization. We conclude that adaptive randomization is a very broad area of experimental design that has important application in modern clinical trials.","inCitations":["55fbaa6ab76e35168d5b0d68546ba51696028ece","287f0b4d84005cdeb36c745ca04b3a52108000e8","4f868195bb82a3e8656e635ddff79c5472a3a3b9","96d98d626c71e2f280b7ab35468cb826127bd7b2","674bded100ed1cad4690b28128997d4021bcba21","5cf6d63f4e168ac404752b493579aa13ce7852d5","ce02bf979cf2d8651b2e25e5b077b034ae35d368","8b40ad2368f884ab7c12ba2b8674db8a7157fdbb","65256e00107d9be2bc6bc07b9a913d1032c5e6f3","883bec59efd4aad0e0cc8f7c62f4662618e9e77a","e165be16f4269258dce2ce18ebdf2be3c9244cfd","55b133c5fc2f118b3ae80b45520b4e7a26dc503a","4cc10ff10c1761afb5f302c1d549708f670e5854","92c4e4e4030a6b168ff04bbdd08e98a763a5be72","a2a1ca1f48afe8fde3d165e767205ce8a35b5a02","5a5bcc34bfc2c0b2aba2d3ed71be2763bfc4468b","9a4d5afa0422b166714cc25b39d6bf6ee8c69122","c9f27e5847e613eb11850aa0df67a3223ffb4770","22ede5ecd73ea793ab020456b4b5f9aeba48160c","fe4f38015e1fafed9bc3e571674111b11299c7d5","2beef38f5a3b7a2fd52e64d2b5a7f7cebc5479b4","85fe9dced2252ccf8bba0ad9f0c4a2ad9a9a869a","4d505614c026b76bdcc6b9e3d40f6e7d82e2356d","60bcf6c6656a5601b83732afc06734add51a2048","863e1498470f98dc70e318719d086f9d11ced446","514321dad84993430b7bc1de1c05e25f99e2f7c5","0412f3a3c864a4ddfba7f93c462c3b7899a9979d"],"title":"Adaptive randomization for clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.676535"}

For this reason, it is useful to select an appropriate discrimination threshold. There are several optimality criteria: the North-West corner, the Youden index, the concordance probability and the symmetry point, among others. In this paper, we focus on the symmetry point that maximizes simultaneously the two types of correct classifications. We construct confidence intervals for this optimal cutpoint and its associated specificity and sensitivity indexes using two approaches: one based on the generalized pivotal quantity and the other on empirical likelihood. We perform a simulation study to check the practical behaviour of both methods and illustrate their use by means of three real biomedical datasets on melanoma, prostate cancer and coronary artery disease.","inCitations":["d2cffa5d9b5768784212b145a49de0db0ab8e8b8","007c95efd807133d295c733a52a9ace62466e775"],"title":"Confidence intervals for the symmetry point: an optimal cutpoint in continuous diagnostic tests.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1734"}

For choosing an appropriate design for this trial the specification of two points is critical: an appropriate model for describing the dose-effect relationship, and the specification of the aims of the trial (objectives), which will be the focus in the present paper. For many situations it is essential to have a robust trial objective that has little risk of changing during the complete trial due to external information. An important and realistic objective of a dose-finding trial is to obtain precise information about key parts of the dose-effect curve. We reflect this goal in a statistical optimality criterion and derive efficient designs using optimal design theory. In particular, we determine nonadaptive Bayesian optimal designs, i.e., designs which are not changed by information obtained from an interim analysis. Compared with a traditional balanced design for this trial, it is shown that the optimal design is substantially more efficient. This implies either a gain in information, or essential savings in sample size. Further, we investigate an adaptive Bayesian optimal design that uses different optimal designs before and after an interim analysis, and we compare the adaptive with the nonadaptive Bayesian optimal design. The basic concept is illustrated using a modification of a recent AstraZeneca trial.","inCitations":["7cbb4678f9782182f0cdfa53c0d40ae433d37493","d1988e2f63b388c1f2943693c01d354d5a506617","c6c9bd12cd9f74d2742b2aade86f1ad071307e24","c7b3d5aeefd4c63c216df5fa4d2dfe551774f0fc","739ae908b974fe86152435aa6e46d4d70c3d16c5","623ae8819d6d9c26d93108ccba7289a7342c681b","c7912d650b6fe98787ca6c52edc24d008f5b355a","55d9a6d121554a1c7b408930ccbc5325f4fc6d86","77659b71e752b1d95f50870b518949d4bd653d20","0e160c5aa5ea047063056bfce00305dc89fc1648","3ff3a8942b9767e164bbc2117f64207bff16e73b","cc5b3ae510f83a3691369883bc84a31bf6b264d3","b88e06c700338d7b87011665d2df1383cc5c9355","d064202a6b88f440f93268467c55012a2a5ab2ad","66d3d9d21879631418f3dc3006bd65b0c60fc7a7","7c119fa476ae77c7f58b0e2ba90b7c34f118cd31","9a4d5afa0422b166714cc25b39d6bf6ee8c69122","dfbb3b913413e068c5e05e9587e5d227944c7be1","bcded7eb099e8ef2026c4f487d015b71c432fdc7","3625cfb60e808a6fca5028c01d58b3ceb5915452","3656fe88b473869063ff2ca316b2912271af552e","1f9dbef7134e4e172ab970804c978d9d675d1ada","573f588d62904ca40b8bf591403871ca761e42da","01eb641410c20ae47f1a83a1660fef439c1c8626","bc881139719447a0bfd4122d7f510a4f2d4e9320","5e8b092727d01909b17e0557e54e45ee95b64067","f4db943abf6862083fcdd45ff050213e4aefd9e9","6fbbd94f127b6a316afa2e43442dce64b02f9448","e21600790a3b8aaa442320ccf9f953524bc8a4dd"],"title":"Optimal designs for estimating the interesting part of a dose-effect curve.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701645140"}

Our approach results in a nonparametric treatment of the distribution of the covariance parameters of the GP covariance matrix that in turn induces a clustering of the covariates. We evaluate two prior constructions: the first one employs a mixture of a point-mass and a continuous distribution as the centering distribution for the DP prior, therefore, clustering all covariates. The second one employs a mixture of a spike and a DP prior with a continuous distribution as the centering distribution, which induces clustering of the selected covariates only. DP models borrow information across covariates through model-based clustering. Our simulation results, in particular, show a reduction in posterior sampling variability and, in turn, enhanced prediction performances. In our model formulations, we accomplish posterior inference by employing novel combinations and extensions of existing algorithms for inference with DP prior models and compare performances under the two prior constructions.","inCitations":["258614d90cb19c664b73cd46a892d54609848ae8","c7d09f2d2c2baf4b5ce18637ab2f0b61149b2b78","1957d40f6cc348b13cbcd0a07db9020004754f72","bfab458ad4d5a5974675370db9b7d9d0ecdb7a4f"],"title":"Spiked Dirichlet Process Priors for Gaussian Process Models.","doi":"10.1155/2010/201489"}

In preparation for the release of the updated guidance document, Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry held a one-day expert group meeting in January 2013. Topics debated included multiplicity and the drug development process, the usefulness and limitations of newly developed strategies to deal with multiplicity, multiplicity issues arising from interim decisions and multiregional development, and the need for simultaneous confidence intervals (CIs) corresponding to multiple test procedures. A clear message from the meeting was that multiplicity adjustments need to be considered when the intention is to make a formal statement about efficacy or safety based on hypothesis tests. Statisticians have a key role when designing studies to assess what adjustment really means in the context of the research being conducted. More thought during the planning phase needs to be given to multiplicity adjustments for secondary endpoints given these are increasing in importance in differentiating products in the market place. No consensus was reached on the role of simultaneous CIs in the context of superiority trials. It was argued that unadjusted intervals should be employed as the primary purpose of the intervals is estimation, while the purpose of hypothesis testing is to formally establish an effect. The opposing view was that CIs should correspond to the test decision whenever possible.","inCitations":["c899a4e7b528d712c4a1508bbe126b9f3e9929db","f289cb4cfcce871e42d2765a0904548252421742","2ec2f4f246eff4b06e154cbec2fdde476226e866","058f7a88a96bee368295f39e455500c6e11d0077","3a1c62946a1ca57fc0e96cb701e061614d347fa5","373a0cd7973ef82407f5a23c01cf9d7471296d78","9ffa0ae498e6ad395b4f8a6b7ffcbd0020cfcb90","c2e320586c483e4347cf23b82a3725396a321965","9281cfdb9e66d0c6bfffbe647a90c6ef3e819e25"],"title":"Multiplicity: discussion points from the Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry multiplicity expert group.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1584"}

However, the marginal mean and variance of these models are assumed to be the same for different gene clusters and for different tissue types. Moreover, it is not easy to determine which of the many competing Bayesian hierarchical models provides the best fit for a specific microarray data set. To address these two issues, we propose a marginal mixture model that directly models the marginal distribution of transformed gene profiles. Specifically, we approximate the marginal distributions of transformed gene profiles via a mixture of three-component multivariate Normal distributions, each component of which has the same structures of marginal mean vector and covariance matrix as those for Bayesian hierarchical models, but the values can differ. Based on the proposed model, a method is derived to select genes differentially expressed across two types of tissue samples. The derived gene selection method performs well on a real microarray data set and consistently has the best performance (based on class agreement indices) compared with several other gene selection methods on simulated microarray data sets generated from three different mixture models.","inCitations":["25ea234c4fe1eaf81be2c02630b5cf9906097517","f28267e3b1bf9cfaf6caa860c3db6c70e0d4f162","b3c350f9f25b3e970372fdd2579fc55447ba88e0","981a6039ca4a5db198a7ce31c2fe10641546d407","027c1592f43e3c0ec29ddc8d47b01be3529e6f10","f517793f25e010e5c45d9d77e5752cd23b5dc723","326d1b5f81592c15862032a04cdfb5f725a94a61","0fd5ec050bf52abd74c6e9c8e03c061e1faf51e3","4405a2c904ee59198c0b28c0db6da6bb4270ec7b"],"title":"A Marginal Mixture Model for Selecting Differentially Expressed Genes across Two Types of Tissue Samples","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1093"}

We present a new approach to LDA for multivariate normal data that accounts for the subject matching used in a particular study design, as well as covariates not used in the matching. Applications are given for post-mortem tissue data with the aim of comparing neurobiological characteristics of subjects with schizophrenia with those of normal controls, and for a post-mortem tissue primate study comparing brain biomarker measurements across three treatment groups.
