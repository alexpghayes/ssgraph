In this study, we use the semiparametric linear transformation model to analyze survival data with selective compliance. We estimate regression parameters and the transformation function based on pseudo-likelihood and a series of estimating equations. We show that the estimators for the regression parameters and transformation function are consistent and asymptotically normal, and both converge to their true values at the rate of n -1/2, the convergence rate expected for a parametric model. The practical utility of the methods is confirmed via simulations as well as an application of a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of sentinel node biopsy in guiding the treatment of invasive melanoma.","inCitations":["cee1f59adb76ba19b629c16dc73af476243cc5db","8b7e92f6c393ef2508d7fa90a73a417a6766ce56","88afae059a4d77db1582291938a7dbdbe34fcac9","f4a1e91e36e7f7a66ff088b666180c0629ffe963","8ef14a17495dc43f38f98477a415129b60604dfc"],"title":"A semiparametric linear transformation model to estimate causal effects for survival data.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.11198"}

However, there is usually some uncertainty with respect to the true treatment effect. It is therefore more realistic to specify an interval for the possible true rate to accommodate this uncertainty. For this situation, we examine comprehensively the overall performance of various Phase II oncology designs and sample size recalculation strategies. The methods and results of our investigations can be used to identify the most appropriate approach for a specific clinical trial situation at hand.

The model uses measures of nutrition and energy intakes via a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) along with repeated 24 hour recalls and adjusting covariates. In order to estimate the usual intake of the food, we phrase usual intake in terms of person-specific random effects, along with day-to-day variability in food and energy consumption. Three levels are incorporated in the model. The first level incorporates information about whether an individual in fact reported consumption of a particular food item. The second level incorporates the amount of intake from those individuals who reported consumption of the food, and the third level incorporates the energy intake. Estimates of posterior means of parameters and distributions of usual intakes are obtained by using Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations. This R function reports to users point estimates and credible intervals for parameters in the model, samples from their posterior distribution, samples from the distribution of usual intake and usual energy intake, trace plots of parameters and summary statistics of usual intake, usual energy intake and energy adjusted usual intake.","inCitations":["11b2498f92afce3e4d3b60652ce6f781313a3bb1","404ef70bf50e15d8ede498a9b213ffa4b913974e","21690aa2c0516ebed246f54ac418db588e4c4d80"],"title":"Intake_epis_food(): An R Function for Fitting a Bivariate Nonlinear Measurement Error Model to Estimate Usual and Energy Intake for Episodically Consumed Foods.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v046.c03"}

When the mediator is misclassified, the validity of mediation analysis can be severely undermined. The contribution of the present work is to study the effects of non-differential misclassification of a binary mediator in the estimation of direct and indirect causal effects when the outcome is either continuous or binary and exposure-mediator interaction can be present, and to allow the correction of misclassification. A hybrid of likelihood-based and predictive value weighting method for misclassification correction coupled with sensitivity analysis is proposed and a second approach using the expectation-maximization algorithm is developed. The correction strategy requires knowledge of a plausible range of sensitivity and specificity parameters. The approaches are applied to a perinatal epidemiological study of the determinants of pre-term birth.","inCitations":["890c025a06753db5153ed59aafa19543d7892be4","6d269995328214fbc619af878edc41d9bfc116ce","614f3e9101e071c9ff439bd90f4d9a55a22049e6","ec93cbc3e0ad90f1465c78d849f06ed67cfb991b","a3766017ea60b20d4e8d46d1a6ff8e443f2921f5","3ffe50c8105ebdc8565b26d6f8a9178439bbf304","b7a56f69476a67387181ea145521a87bdfc6720b","a057d20d652d6a9696f8391323c2e6e569d463f5","2e1f774f29cee2b069788239e4427365b268a2c6","dba0064653e4a05f05bf948d71a2746066b099c0"],"title":"The estimation of direct and indirect causal effects in the presence of misclassified binary mediator.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu007"}

An estimation procedure known as asymptotic distribution free (ADF), making no distributional assumption, has been suggested to avoid these biases. Corrections to the normal theory statistics to yield more adequate performance have also been proposed. This study compares the performance of a scaled test statistic and robust standard errors for two models under several non-normal conditions and also compares these with the results from ML and ADF methods. Both ML and ADF test statistics performed rather well in one model and considerably worse in the other. In general, the scaled test statistic seemed to behave better than the ML test statistic and the ADF statistic performed the worst. The robust and ADF standard errors yielded more appropriate estimates of sampling variability than the ML standard errors, which were usually downward biased, in both models under most of the non-normal conditions. ML test statistics and standard errors were found to be quite robust to the violation of the normality assumption when data had either symmetric and platykurtic distributions, or non-symmetric and

In fact, sub-types within the same disease have been shown to have differing gene expression profiles. Often, researchers are interested in differentiating a disease by a categorical classification indicative of disease progression. For example, it may be of interest to identify genes that are associated with progression and to accurately predict the state of progression using gene expression data. One challenge when modeling microarray gene expression data is that there are more genes (variables) than there are observations. In addition, the genes usually demonstrate a complex variance-covariance structure. Therefore, modeling a categorical variable reflecting disease progression using gene expression data presents the need for methods capable of handling an ordinal outcome in the presence of a high dimensional covariate space. We present a method that combines the stereotype regression model with an elastic net penalty as a method capable of modeling an ordinal outcome for high-throughput genomic data sets. Results from the application of the proposed method to gene expression data are reported and the effectiveness of the proposed method is discussed.","inCitations":["13eee13837108653dc2bdc5b1a6bd14466725072"],"title":"Elastic Net Constrained Stereotype Logit Model for Ordered Categorical Data.","doi":"10.15406/bbij.2015.02.00049"}

We present a l(1) penalized likelihood method and an efficient coordinate descent-based computational algorithm for model selection and estimation in such matrix normal graphical models (MNGMs). We provide theoretical results on the asymptotic distributions, the rates of convergence of the estimates and the sparsistency, allowing both the numbers of genes and tissues to diverge as the sample size goes to infinity. Simulation results demonstrate that the MNGMs can lead to better estimate of the precision matrices and better identifications of the graph structures than the standard Gaussian graphical models. We illustrate the methods with an analysis of mouse gene expression data measured over ten different tissues.","inCitations":["0630448087f4e7da034d5a510045969a628b02e8","3c1b59da08de3d15212adfb0a1903c0011ffcf22","fa499a7cb25be1ee090f00a7adc920da2f2e28ab","7b52d0dc1faebd61bd69231b91b920372254a8d4","fb58e9fd61829045802ca42d9aae34670fa1a065","9ac63d0c044df09211dfd178d4a587523861d398","8ce30e8c0846b06680755c465d850e1db914de95","499d82c65d3dfa4e7e637d1f3a7532a4b6f44820","82e469fab686e94b96638543d2a973a6c054dab3","ad2a6a2b94184a6dad3d8c4eef99aa3eb1b313c3","4071fb7fcdfda799f3de4a242d08242444cfeae1","50894f217236e342a8b1abea0c69c02fd58083b4","eacc49577bf5797907bec9777d44ae26493f1cfb","407b18c598f775d1e268e46cbd6c1b8e3c583af6","3e6febce1d0fecc7f269cfa08f9c24b8fd5c73cb","d7c526f2f51131c0f78d1b5a6ec1795b545d525f","c7160b48dfc7008e8e41e08873ff531f37eea69c","1805348d08bd72862347ce49ac0b813959f053a3","0300d4ca14847841d60a955f52ec35051af0c172","cd84d1d9eadc85e08e77d9dc8575acdcc7bf0c3b","04f1e69af1af9bf6c284d6f902f27fc692255ea2","bc01ca64766eb0e8e5b17c6af4dc86c8bfcd4c58","73c2df7531e37d6293fbdd7b26ad0e5895f77716","23fb0f63d8167e1f1e8d2bd5c025b723eec4a2e4","28ba70019c019e32a0abbab0c6c39fc64335db36","3e1045b3927a4a609108cadf5fc7f38856044bb5","9b6337bd13696ebe2caa5833af8e0d759688d32b","b91a31e63748468e156207c633cb2481da462cc7","2ab81c6c63065287d69ba7d1fad6f94db17f1fa9","1e20a56a50eae790bf40a707379a2e95d94c87b0","ddebdbfc189f25585cb367b69ae15051e9f195d0","6d1ca0c201affdf49c8a91310bc8cd7cec659567","ddacabdfab138761ec6c21849f2723c94721e345","283d417873bcac56b6a7ac9a50ac4a3d61b077af","e3c5330eefa5a263d2671c2418531aa07510efe2","b6fcaed5c354bc7ca285dffb5f6b7a661183a195","00e97e460b55ddced51ef6b36356fbaef1e91978","9165b85d73188bd8d29ac1a47d8142c727ebcb92"],"title":"Model selection and estimation in the matrix normal graphical model","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2012.01.005"}

In this paper a general transition model is proposed for longitudinal ordinal responses with random dropout. Maximum likelihood estimates are obtained for the transition probabilities when there are repeated observations. The likelihood function of the general model is partitioned to make possible the use of existing software to estimate model parameters. Some reduced forms of the model are also considered where for estimation of parameters in these models one has to use numerical optimization methods. The approach is applied to the well-known Fluvoxamine data. For these data, two important results, which have not been previously reported, are obtained: (1) some transition probabilities are estimated to be zero and (2) the model for current response, which conditions on previous response, removes the effects of some covariates that had previously been significant.","inCitations":["e94628885e735837eb568a81ef4cace752cb91a2","94253de43a8f20fa5a8c2ea25608b9dba60ada01","667ebcd189e194d44ffabe1f1e911c087c1cc1ff","0ff7a61d1488a47ad9c0d1b65ffbd722466bbaf3","79149ae10dc44755feec7ec5e333625d1063d283"],"title":"A transition model for ordinal response data with random dropout: an application to the fluvoxamine data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400902964100"}

Based on simulations, we have concluded that starting from three candidate model families (linear, exponential, and Emax) the model averaging approach leads to treatment effect estimates that are quite robust with respect to the control of the type I error in nearly all simulated scenarios; in particular, with the model averaging approach, the type I error appears less sensitive to model misspecification than the widely used linear model. We noticed also few differences in terms of performance between the model averaging approach and the more classical model selection approach, but we believe that, despite both can be recommended in practice, the model averaging approach can be more appealing because of some deficiencies of model selection approach pointed out in the literature. We think that a model averaging or model selection approach should be systematically considered for conducting concentration-QT analyses.

Popular approaches for analyzing partially observed datasets include complete case analysis (CCA), multiple imputation (MI), and inverse probability weighting (IPW). In the case of missing covariate values, these methods (as typically implemented) are valid under different missingness assumptions. In particular, CCA is valid under missing not at random (MNAR) mechanisms in which missingness in a covariate depends on the value of that covariate, but is conditionally independent of outcome. In this paper, we argue that in some settings such an assumption is more plausible than the missing at random assumption underpinning most implementations of MI and IPW. When the former assumption holds, although CCA gives consistent estimates, it does not make use of all observed information. We therefore propose an augmented CCA approach which makes the same conditional independence assumption for missingness as CCA, but which improves efficiency through specification of an additional model for the probability of missingness, given the fully observed variables. The new method is evaluated using simulations and illustrated through application to data on reported alcohol consumption and blood pressure from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which data are likely MNAR independent of outcome.","inCitations":["459a53dcc4dad1d28c7313df349674f41ed2a0b3","7aea1697744ae325fe49f3dc4cf3a85966af2388","dd6656e9c6f02e4d51b0081e610b92086e6fdd36","a0fd82f0b3ecab308914c1aefa8c58df15cabea0","747b273e0f37c3d34f5d7c5bd487a6605d6b0a08","bc2d7897e4ff20305275bb8cfc91858a3cd86827","8bf831e3398ce79badb8e2f2d4ef70638b054228","2c88c4a5f3976b9890f38a3af1a4ca4e717e622b","38b608393d06a88a3fcfa7d40adae9fc084c99b4","09ac614165ad5dd744a3180c84f249382be99fe9","b9eaa4998e2e4758b064fd3cee0cb80f07032309","9cfab9b5785dff7f07e6588e3fa8da645b9d8182","19903e3e89ea5abba74ecc825e73c57591cbbf8a","30d460c71fbb2ac90b43ef881545f85422170e68","6e6362fa54828006448e3f1451cab0a2124caf8d","afec38822a3beb00ba0291481b244de5966e5387","dfab6d32a48e502226d9ac975bb03dee7f3daece","07e7e6753af2e3da48778631f20187084beee646","4a2c49d3801b0f37df2c83f81f0b96959ba70b18","5b97a2edbea8dbe26a3d0cf359e2c57abf185d57","2e5d8ac0e2d602345c243244f45f7930be2a0232","80329e459029f867ee3aa0ac70f7682034e67f2d"],"title":"Improving upon the efficiency of complete case analysis when covariates are MNAR","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu023"}

Our approach is unified in that it can deal with any scalar measure of agreement currently available in the literature, and can incorporate repeated and unreplicated measurements, and balanced as well as unbalanced designs. Our key idea is to treat an agreement measure as a functional of the joint cumulative distribution function of the measurements from multiple methods. This measure is estimated nonparametrically by plugging-in a weighted empirical counterpart of the joint distribution function. The resulting estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal under some specified assumptions. A closed-form expression is provided for the asymptotic standard error of the estimator. This asymptotic normality is used to derive a large-sample distribution-free methodology for simultaneously comparing the multiple measurement methods. The small-sample performance of this methodology is investigated via simulation. The asymptotic efficiency of the proposed nonparametric estimator relative to the normality-based maximum likelihood estimator is also examined. The methodology is illustrated by applying it to a blood pressure data set involving repeated measurements from three measurement methods.","inCitations":["00bfac2e71ca84fbe0519b9953137151526d4bc8","7049a7f75b093a24ab87c968d569c0576e3525cd","c633b4332b5f59bc51d9bb2e2a883cdb0f8a2058"],"title":"A Unified Approach for Nonparametric Evaluation of Agreement in Method Comparison Studies","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1235"}

The joint analysis provides more flexibility in terms of how parameters are fitted and estimated and tends to be more powerful than the gene-specific analysis. Here we show how to implement the gene-specific linear mixed model analysis as an exact algorithm for the joint linear mixed model analysis. The gene-specific algorithm is exact, when the mixed model equations can be partitioned into unrelated components: One for all global fixed and random effects and the others for the gene-specific fixed and random effects for each gene separately. This unrelatedness holds under three conditions: (1) any gene must have the same number of replicates or probes on all arrays, but these numbers can differ among genes; (2) the residual variance of the (transformed) expression data must be homogeneous or constant across genes (other variance components need not be homogeneous) and (3) the number of genes in the experiment is large. When these conditions are violated, the gene-specific algorithm is expected to be nearly exact.","inCitations":["1b9a5aa3230a300506d443b4d0b5f72cbd7b7166","d1c7af4c0a678b407dedc8162afc2498c98ee990","42493d3215a616aec7dc457463540195c46c6f4d","1f5b8f72528b20a2a12ffd20f32367691f7af708","8194c0f5fe8fe85d39414ce3ee3c23475415dae4"],"title":"A note on joint versus gene-specific mixed model analysis of microarray gene expression data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi001"}

Two problems arise: (i) in a world of explosively big data, effective methods are needed to handle ultra-high dimensional data set, for example, with the dimension of predictors is of the non-polynomial (NP) order of the sample size; (ii) both the propensity score and conditional mean models need to be estimated from data under NP dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a robust procedure for estimating the optimal treatment regime under NP dimensionality. In both steps, penalized regressions are employed with the non-concave penalty function, where the conditional mean model of the response given predictors may be misspecified. The asymptotic properties, such as weak oracle properties, selection consistency and oracle distributions, of the proposed estimators are investigated. In addition, we study the limiting distribution of the estimated value function for the obtained optimal treatment regime. The empirical performance of the proposed estimation method is evaluated by simulations and an application to a depression dataset from the STAR*D study.","inCitations":["9007641579f5e9e0dc3cd4fa87bf167cb97f15c5","fd836e39c289f8a0823711317e861d6b10018670","d78aba5c3593aa740983e5d09a88a373b7400f93"],"title":"Robust learning for optimal treatment decision with NP-dimensionality.","doi":"10.1214/16-EJS1178"}

In this paper, we consider how to improve this planning when using data from phase 2 trials. We use an approach based on the concept of assurance. We consider adjusting phase 2 results because of two possible sources of bias. The first source arises from selecting compounds with pre-specified favourable phase 2 results and using these favourable results as the basis of treatment effect for phase 3 sample size planning. The next source arises from projecting phase 2 treatment effect to the phase 3 population when this projection is optimistic because of a generally more heterogeneous patient population at the confirmatory stage. In an attempt to reduce the impact of these two sources of bias, we adjust (discount) the phase 2 estimate of treatment effect. We consider multiplicative and additive adjustment. Following a previously proposed concept, we consider the properties of several criteria, termed launch criteria, for deciding whether or not to progress development to phase 3. We use simulations to investigate launch criteria with or without bias adjustment for the sample size calculation under various scenarios. The simulation results are supplemented with empirical evidence to support the need to discount phase 2 results when the latter are used in phase 3 planning. Finally, we offer some recommendations based on both the simulations and the empirical investigations.","inCitations":["3d4183a2afaa11365803e195d0d13f6f2e91a450","1ccb0574255929a8c03e4f1512df071d049f07a0","090a699485f216815e3f8792ddf627b5f817f8e6","91d2b821cef88a54a60ca098fc2f326ce5a024d9","ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb","5a7877a7a6744ebc9aa33d3edad004ea332e7a27","8342ead7a5da3fe540219c1e40bd83620e7aa6de","6ae9cd0dc35480f12996d8fb572efea51dc6a41e","8c9b9fbde17c6ce9bd56a54d7e059a18da4c6276","23d50b35865a7065e2861329a8605f9064f73112","3853b6962d73c80d1a57753d657602b12599f1eb","6321888ec531cf04a48e7a41d7ae1a1e7be58967"],"title":"Discounting phase 2 results when planning phase 3 clinical trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1521"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2018,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Prior information is often incorporated informally when planning a clinical trial. Here, we present an approach on how to incorporate prior information, such as data from historical clinical trials, into the nuisance parameter-based sample size re-estimation in a design with an internal pilot study. We focus on trials with continuous endpoints in which the outcome variance is the nuisance parameter. For planning and analyzing the trial, frequentist methods are considered. Moreover, the external information on the variance is summarized by the Bayesian meta-analytic-predictive approach. To incorporate external information into the sample size re-estimation, we propose to update the meta-analytic-predictive prior based on the results of the internal pilot study and to re-estimate the sample size using an estimator from the posterior. By means of a simulation study, we compare the operating characteristics such as power and sample size distribution of the proposed procedure with the traditional sample size re-estimation approach that uses the pooled variance estimator. The simulation study shows that, if no prior-data conflict is present, incorporating external information into the sample size re-estimation improves the operating characteristics compared to the traditional approach. In the case of a prior-data conflict, that is, when the variance of the ongoing clinical trial is unequal to the prior location, the performance of the traditional sample size re-estimation procedure is in general superior, even when the prior information is robustified. When considering to include prior information in sample size re-estimation, the potential gains should be balanced against the risks.","inCitations":["090e6c9926263ba0563f37609187801e257fc229","512ef99cce2ff6f449736cce06f468cf762d9446"],"title":"Sample size re-estimation incorporating prior information on a nuisance parameter.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1837"}

Unlike several previous covariance matrix estimators, the new methods take into account both the item and structural parameters. The relationships between the observed information matrix, the empirical cross-product information matrix, the sandwich-type covariance matrix and the two approaches proposed by de la Torre (2009, J. Educ. Behav. Stat., 34, 115) are discussed. Simulation results show that, for a correctly specified CDM and Q-matrix or with a slightly misspecified probability model, the observed information matrix and the sandwich-type covariance matrix exhibit good performance with respect to providing consistent standard errors of item parameter estimates. However, with substantial model misspecification only the sandwich-type covariance matrix exhibits robust performance.","inCitations":["9d8a0c76030e3e56cf50fe9d37ed75374870f59b","d6aa775e5711f3f587f6a46df44cae8a71018a8a"],"title":"Information matrix estimation procedures for cognitive diagnostic models.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12134"}

The specified effect size may be overly optimistic, leading to an underpowered study. The assumed variance can be either too small or too large, leading, respectively, to studies that are underpowered or overly large. There has been much work in the clinical trials field on various types of sequential designs that include sample size reestimation after the trial is started, but these have seen only little use in BE studies. The purpose of this work was to validate at least one such method for crossover design BE studies. Specifically, we considered sample size reestimation for a two-stage trial based on the variance estimated from the first stage. We identified two methods based on Pocock's method for group sequential trials that met our requirement for at most negligible increase in type I error rate.","inCitations":["b8aedd0dc1cb88cfd4bd4cf1e52187166e606ea7","97623f2ef8a691b047dfdfbe9cce5984e0cb648e","907abf8aeefcc48b34c28663f01713c6c394cbbb","96f7dc695568b4fe557972654ed99271dea2fb3a","fe75166bbcbfc729dd777d6206955796e1d821b2","5e514b658952a165106fe3ea61e878c5bdd8088b","eebaf36f03178f85c8dadc9285e194586c1b726a","6808968fbfafa128285c0b03ce814c97343df722","a97b53f4cb4d14a18fc5663ed0ca2254e0012cf1","77fbca12dbeda21c66744112d85f9454f362f0ed","892ac327beb798cd50282b1f0ca62a715611ca92","ea1f6108acafd59f95affd489e7671841fc7c92e","93aa285297d412cd877a24a53366bd94462fd1c8","0f1322005838579e7adab6d4fd860b3e54308b6e","a482561dc18e6a276b4c708ec3fc5f86485394cd","3485c87ea4c014b50e93759f1e9f021421a083d6","62943c91aa008c4b9338195c767b467fe6a3314f","c72a87cf47beb86fcb9c28b1df8a52bd581455d2","8ca8c03bb1cf2106b66ff6b4edaeb0d63a0163b7","2f60dc3064136e0d59b37ee541240b1cd8cd4d8a","fccca25c2372bc63fdd5cd3217be288ec623d8f0","aa01fc79340143e2423e4bb6080012d1fb2e8b9e","77c3be6703305ec7ab9ec9c65f674198aa4c575a","36dcc456974eea31718f57579fa9b99ab3d6daf1","47b74ef7ff4a25f64a358aa76ba05f1e2d081a1c","7707da32657720093723e6d9f8c5cb0aae3bc106","bc07f5d7acec63279325d78237fae57f4b7e17ac","9c377992051ba19b2df1ffbc70aecb12670a6d61","42149fd1e6b399ce280f79edc06cb718037da82b","956e7aeba4a94f8366321f0da258eb2a3e5d8df4","9d84fdaae6c7ca304d361bd831879e405fbdd680","736b6c783f0ac26975c41fb537848395b2aa1089"],"title":"Sequential design approaches for bioequivalence studies with crossover designs.","doi":"10.1002/pst.294"}

Such adjustment can improve the assessment of vaccine efficacy as well as the assessment of risk factors. It can be attained by modeling transmission per contact with infectious sources. However, information about contacts that rely on self-reporting by study participants are subject to nontrivial measurement error in many studies. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to estimate the vaccine efficacy controlled for exposure to infection, while adjusting for measurement error in contact-related factors. Our method is used to re-analyze two recent HIV vaccine studies, and the results are compared with the published primary analyses that used standard methods. The proposed method could also be used for other vaccines where contact information is collected, such as human papilloma virus vaccines.","inCitations":["79062970b13aa443105bf4fc434435cd660a74e2","14b2344883a4275bdab879494eb0e57dee74d49c","12c3660c37af4a311a3a14667a12ce48388dd6ce","52120421e148519f208384ac7fe46ed134e43576"],"title":"A Bayesian Framework for Estimating Vaccine Efficacy per Infectious Contact.","doi":"10.1214/08-AOAS193"}

It is often used in situations where the target population is rare and/or stigmatized in the larger population, so that it is prohibitively expensive to contact them through the available frames. Common examples include injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, and female sex workers. Most analysis of RDS data has focused on estimating aggregate characteristics, such as disease prevalence. However, RDS is often conducted in settings where the population size is unknown and of great independent interest. This paper presents an approach to estimating the size of a target population based on data collected through RDS. The proposed approach uses a successive sampling approximation to RDS to leverage information in the ordered sequence of observed personal network sizes. The inference uses the Bayesian framework, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge. A flexible class of priors for the population size is used that aids elicitation. An extensive simulation study provides insight into the performance of the method for estimating population size under a broad range of conditions. A further study shows the approach also improves estimation of aggregate characteristics. Finally, the method demonstrates sensible results when used to estimate the size of known networked populations from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and when used to estimate the size of a hard-to-reach population at high risk for HIV.","inCitations":["624e0ae140a358d9e6209d0163c56ebb8d0ebff7","1151f7bb9efbf970c4ebc3c17707764971b0c884","2e278308f5125849f6b73e4b4c6c41f487fb56e1","d69962769f1dc9158a6f1414e357e74c4f7715de","78f93e25acd6d9c87f5b72ed169a8833f14c4f2b","d2e083080dca1afd8ee678b43166d518867a4b22","01ceb44156ec5190bf5a49a7af57a87b38d15ec9","5c4d28516ff2f43c283d84f5fed3895773d58063","9ff80fcb8f5d020f748c106a618660585817d68c","c7d064b4b072c9ec5b16240e91b3129b681ac418","7b600a92684162ac8dadae6ea301f6dfe95999ae","20db06a33b5a5701bfd2e0d3813c55c9fe34d77d","834300dd8f45bffd05c7f8597677c9d9ac174a77","6a5b3aec4031df9e7885ca77f6d2b05e30b0c7b3","f43547228d1b1ed85b55cb25bf5be704df4296b2","9ffbd744a216b2dc61829c29a5dec7a5c3850c5c","9e0bc8f2cbf5dca176cc36175fbc085ff40b723b","ae3da39548348b1944e5ec144edb165f54cdb82b","e913e9c76e55654d0590ae5faf957d464f1120c3","71a48c6df1128685430061811262c892fe3ea2ae","7f3eddbf1376d753433b6e8dfb83a3cd3c8f740d","7d2869b91f142eca721909f4594c95e9f5999b1e","1aa32290fdbca4e9cd3e38776e795e293e97b13f","f3d489269d8d1b2ca32282dc542cedfee36900fb","f954747bf653fef9ad62f6fe55be508bf32fced0","1f961421681b09835da602ed609178f47c4bf04b","3114924e764819294da6d01268bb61cbbc1ff5ab","4fc7e9b7a71a4aebaae6c3f1f8784fc22d78ff8e","10b39045504843890b64beff6d5cb6ae18e42d54","f99f9816e463cb8081562aff3d0b5d527c5ddffd","59c0b6a22972bc7c1ccadd102dd816efd9fd3796","0394414c9bee781e39b788be4a7cf3e455acda3c","96d9cf07072433a56b682410ac4fc2fba9389502","31cee11c13dac8484daec5c8be86694a993e2516","46d0264eb1c35252403023114806b66bfbe572c2"],"title":"Estimating hidden population size using Respondent-Driven Sampling data.","doi":"10.1214/14-EJS923"}

In health disparity indices (HDIs) such as the mean log deviation (MLD) and Theil index (TI), disparities are relative to the population average, whereas in the index of disparity (IDisp) the reference is the group with the least adverse health outcome. Although the latter may be preferable, identification of a reference group can be affected by statistical reliability. To address this issue, we propose a new HDI, the Rényi index (RI), which is reference-invariant. When standardized, the RI extends the Atkinson index, where a disparity aversion parameter can incorporate societal values associated with health equity. In addition, both the MLD and TI are limiting cases of the RI. Also, a symmetrized Rényi index (SRI) can be constructed, resulting in a symmetric measure in the two distributions whose relative entropy is being evaluated. We discuss alternative symmetric and reference-invariant HDIs derived from the generalized entropy (GE) class and the Bregman divergence, and argue that the SRI is more robust than its GE-based counterpart to small changes in the distribution of the adverse health outcome. We evaluate the design-based standard errors and bootstrapped sampling distributions for the SRI, and illustrate the proposed methodology using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on the 2001-04 prevalence of moderate or severe periodontitis among adults aged 45-74, which tracks Oral Health objective OH-5 in HP2020. Such data, which uses a binary individual-level outcome variable, are typical of HP2020 data.","inCitations":["0fe30321927509144cde7917c3a0476564f7a1dd","e42e887903ad75c21c392aa1b6283bea8e0733a0","2062954f3bd6b1b3474492e8730e9ef561f65c70","c82f0814f0962b8966b2c577db2cfe8515478247","d505ba117c8fa08dc5e043ae198dcf323283ac8d"],"title":"A Reference-invariant Health Disparity Index Based on Rényi Divergence.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS621"}

In general, the sample size formula for Rosner's statistic based on the dependence assumption is highly recommended in the sense that its actual power is satisfactorily close to the desired power level.

Specifically, the important role that multistage designs can play in the elimination of false-positive associations and in the control of study costs will be noted. Also, the trade-offs associated with using pooled DNA at early design stages for additional important cost reductions will be discussed in some detail. An odds ratio approach to relating SNP alleles to disease risk using pooled DNA will be proposed, in conjunction with a simple empirical variance estimator, based on comparisons among log-odds ratio estimators from distinct pairs of case and control pools. Simulation studies will be presented to evaluate the moderate sample size properties of such multistage designs and estimation procedures. The design of an ongoing three-stage study in the Women's Health Initiative to relate 250,000 SNPs to the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer will provide illustration, and will be used to motivate the choice of simulation configurations.","inCitations":["8b5d5b2b9b63692423f928933ffc525a8c18b20d","48d6c8526d3cdfc47c75bd1f9fc937064e14ef26","4f6dc4617e78dc66c5dc7076828f3abc4eb60d4f","53900010730ff2b4eb7753063f2c14a837ae631f","09ee35a07b25c25cc22d37d957ae22478c5c0580","fa4bf1b7e48a38028695be71477981d1d58d514c","294f29739d17dc0df6c1daa5b2254267d97bb4a2","efccb19d68bd4a0bbbc31d93787e6bfe1c80b331","0a6036093c5aabd62aa45a6976883a7b9209e5e9","d1afc1bac9c451642735a9d50f4f1503db7b19f8","a881ab5b4083186f669e9fdec7e18d4308a7c6b4","fc1b970957fa6fd503de8573e4a505ffb12dc2fb","b8ca2340e747b2dd697ba07b6f178b8104a23965","f314baf2fd4a9fb257db4cc514fbf7d68a3c7995","14a9f1bae2e1db75bcfe1bcf9eea1106af0f901e","d7b7d23b2a4bec522634526e82648f61731dcf92","c7002c3e783a8dbab8845d32d2bff821a5a0a1ab","f1da96cf4f72467b6cf01516f59c822278d0761f","f4f109f6a6f29ed23dc73450bebdadaca646ef9e","bedce3a713817b0acdea69dd1d4b2f47708bb093","0e710332c225115f296bb2c164bac9bf8010fae7","177951df0f6223d05a50fbec605d6c71bfd14e01"],"title":"Aspects of the design and analysis of high-dimensional SNP studies for disease risk estimation.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj020"}
