Three recently developed methods for detecting heteroscedasticity are examined. In addition, three heteroscedastic robust tests of OLS coefficients are considered. A major finding is that performing a test of heteroscedasticity prior to applying a heteroscedastic robust test can lead to poor control over Type I errors.","inCitations":["692344619fdf799e1db9dc7e3464b242ae5b7d21","9a061e5a4f9f2eef112805fc8e65d3ba2e09d3fe","6b62503659844f859dab1d86fa19881ede5e0b34","79746df73cf88436072b0bf47e6545c6488e1f0f","075a5b1e67cb51c5b490cae71e9c4af45b156182","3c9a5a0ebc41b13e99ffa96bc490fa800f00332f","8c5e5489bbaf1c7baf83f6cefa55e5ba57f2e251","b486c9954f6fb2f36bf851cca6cc4a07d478ce76"],"title":"A comparison of two-stage procedures for testing least-squares coefficients under heteroscedasticity.","doi":"10.1348/000711010X508683"}

An adaptive thresholding procedure is introduced and theoretical guarantees are given. Minimax rate of convergence is established and the proposed estimator is shown to be adaptively rate-optimal over collections of paired correlation matrices with approximately sparse differences. Simulation results show that the procedure significantly outperforms two other natural methods that are based on separate estimation of the individual correlation matrices. The procedure is also illustrated through an analysis of a breast cancer dataset, which provides evidence at the gene co-expression level that several genes, of which a subset has been previously verified, are associated with the breast cancer. Hypothesis testing on the differential correlation matrices is also considered. A test, which is particularly well suited for testing against sparse alternatives, is introduced. In addition, other related problems, including estimation of a single sparse correlation matrix, estimation of the differential covariance matrices, and estimation of the differential cross-correlation matrices, are also discussed.","inCitations":["06186400a108dcb6ede55f1184619ff5a8999e74","9265b53958c2d4dfaa91eaabe13b8bd6ea1a0ebf","739787de4a67827d1e52b5fa669f562340cc14c3","908a37c745257e66259def410c22e5ce16e7a74e","9657098dd972250a9066eeb4e57a761587f71b6d","20df179ac839b14f112c2337240bed675bb1b6f3"],"title":"Inference for high-dimensional differential correlation matrices","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2015.08.019"}

In the Bayesian framework, the deviance information criterion (DIC) and the logarithm of the pseudo marginal likelihood (LPML) are two well-known Bayesian criteria for comparing joint models. However, these criteria do not provide separate assessments of each component of the joint model. In this paper, we develop a novel decomposition of DIC and LPML to assess the fit of the longitudinal and survival components of the joint model, separately. Based on this decomposition, we then propose new Bayesian model assessment criteria, namely, ΔDIC and ΔLPML, to determine the importance and contribution of the longitudinal (survival) data to the model fit of the survival (longitudinal) data. Moreover, we develop an efficient Monte Carlo method for computing the Conditional Predictive Ordinate (CPO) statistics in the joint modeling setting. A simulation study is conducted to examine the empirical performance of the proposed criteria and the proposed methodology is further applied to a case study in mesothelioma.","inCitations":["d9136a902cc6c26447f98d0de4345cee9943f200","cfb412833b0a73481cb01bfae32eb77a2ed2d7e6","029dbf87204e2f9f6a5ff213f69b0825d991b717","5a3922e03a0b74712bb75cf537b9545a32ad2f7c"],"title":"Bayesian Model Assessment in Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Survival Data with Applications to Cancer Clinical Trials.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2015.1117472"}

Mixed modeling is a useful analytical tool for characterizing genotype-phenotype associations among multiple potentially informative genetic loci. This approach involves grouping individuals into genetic clusters, where individuals in the same cluster have similar or identical multilocus genotypes. In haplotype-based investigations of unrelated individuals, corresponding cluster assignments are unobservable since the alignment of alleles within chromosomal copies is not generally observed. We derive an expectation conditional maximization approach to estimation in the mixed modeling setting, where cluster assignments are ambiguous. The approach has broad relevance to the analysis of data with missing correlated data identifiers. An example is provided based on data arising from a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus type-1-infected individuals at risk for antiretroviral therapy-associated dyslipidemia.","inCitations":["e33578d3c091a66d936a6f0ef3cfe8fddfd90c1a","35f39803143545ce6b1c1c4e224357a2ff8a0617","633bf3fc1fb752afc4a0f7706c240b47215837bf","8d0abad5fce08e0293932a4ab9390b951270affc","9a537b89015fce8ab0d1caa1497da9d8c72fb6f5","6ca09687155c96e998704dad33799d6dd634f3b6"],"title":"A likelihood-based approach to mixed modeling with ambiguity in cluster identifiers","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm055"}

One aim is to identify units exhibiting elevated disease risks, so that public health interventions can be made. Bayesian hierarchical models with a spatially smooth conditional autoregressive prior are used for this purpose, but they cannot identify the spatial extent of high-risk clusters. Therefore, we propose a two-stage solution to this problem, with the first stage being a spatially adjusted hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. This algorithm is applied to data prior to the study period, and produces [Formula: see text] potential cluster structures for the disease data. The second stage fits a separate Poisson log-linear model to the study data for each cluster structure, which allows for step-changes in risk where two clusters meet. The most appropriate cluster structure is chosen by model comparison techniques, specifically by minimizing the Deviance Information Criterion. The efficacy of the methodology is established by a simulation study, and is illustrated by a study of respiratory disease risk in Glasgow, Scotland.","inCitations":["0256dcbfeed0e3c1ffb7cec24b53d6c24018d28b","837d6ed0b0022b7d31d5407d75ebde5bc0479d6a","4b1ddd77ab378e2f57bbce9c50572477b5274201","d7e2b110576f0ee9e303721fb3c1b2f2fdfe9aee","602e12f41f63ec38c86f4be0ddb62f53b2e6f606","428e347830c7ceb639ac088d37a66385305be68b","f7a06cbe8bae9acd7453c48f3d609d719f0d54da","659ac9880dfe3cf245bc6124e7d4d447c4b65631","b1d5ca8abbbaf0324da81acce21f9f67b512de78","f1647d6f47ff95148fd100f1565771b94e21897f","6bfda196fd4f731d57164786458cfbb17df17716","b7ed8059362b4e0ad3fe2d5834adc2e0cfe54460","3810304451cd6d8f1cefb07ec4b7d22ac7b75702","f7361576749d1ce3541aeff3e3eeda55525221b6","8d381a63294d39faff38bab716cea2a41dea6b17","c0ac409379dcca86a5ede8ed74cce77f0f703256","01f299727da3d2a28d2312610317be05ba0db11c","e4fdec0c891100cd68afb134e0b075e78347eca7","c76a69c1a43c8b4bf995079a6a66266aa8b3fbc0","69f4d4de0f8bc2b773207bd3e454b4b3723b22c6","7e714608f0b47d39592294a4af42ec9f5ca47ddb","00f8e22eca2302af43055b1bcc9fbed5b5bfc73e","5882feeec221d1607b9342b27a2952f7005361d3"],"title":"Identifying clusters in Bayesian disease mapping.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu005"}

However, Williams' test and other step-down multiple comparison tests only provide results in terms of statistical significance. In this paper, approximate confidence intervals are proposed for some step-down multiple comparison tests and their coverage properties are assessed by simulation; p-values are readily calculated. The proposed simultaneous confidence intervals associated with Williams' test, Dunnett's step-down test, and the closed t test are all found to have good coverage, typically between 94% and 96% for a nominal value of 95%. Thus practicing statisticians can now quote p-values for these tests and use simple confidence intervals to aid interpretation of test results.","inCitations":["d3a3e925d4cd7b60b373f52542d068e4bd79656d","532bd6d5de7d2390c51b675e4dab0d7839bf73e9"],"title":"Confidence intervals and p-values for Williams' and other step-down multiple comparison tests against control.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100104197"}

It enables one to carry out genome-wide screening for regions of genetic alterations, such as chromosome gains and losses, or localized amplifications and deletions. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm 'Cluster along chromosomes' (CLAC) for the analysis of array CGH data. CLAC builds hierarchical clustering-style trees along each chromosome arm (or chromosome), and then selects the 'interesting' clusters by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at a certain level. In addition, it provides a consensus summary across a set of arrays, as well as an estimate of the corresponding FDR. We illustrate the method using an application of CLAC on a lung cancer microarray CGH data set as well as a BAC array CGH data set of aneuploid cell

We employ Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate the use of these sample size formulae and evaluate the accuracy of sample size calculation formula derived from the asymptotic test procedure with respect to power in a variety of situations. We note that when both the relative treatment effect of interest and the underlying intraclass correlation between frequencies within patients are large, the sample size calculation based on the asymptotic test procedure can lose accuracy. In this case, the sample size calculation procedure based on the exact test is recommended. On the other hand, if the relative treatment effect of interest is small, the minimum required number of patients per group will be large, and the asymptotic test procedure will be valid for use. In this case, we may consider use of the sample size calculation formula derived from the asymptotic test procedure to reduce the number of patients needed for the exact test procedure. We include an example regarding a double-blind randomized crossover trial comparing salmeterol with a placebo in exacerbations of asthma to illustrate the practical use of these sample size formulae.","inCitations":["ec1c22bb87244cdf2b6783a6085333ccc8547ac1","2d7970459d6b4a70fbf165a46e311fd48d599e02","aabd572c0da5535f826215f6b6eee19967b95250","60483aa92d9e12b36479e76d9b6716adc1935e53","3cacaedb531d0b9f1fc36c0caacc89318318b13b","f4855c11465e59b6dbba836247da11cd654c3c3b"],"title":"Sample size determination for testing equality in Poisson frequency data under an AB/BA crossover trial.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1555"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"It is well known that outliers can have a significant effect on the conclusion of a bioavailability/bioequivalence study. Existing approaches for outlier detection are ANOVA type based on the assumptions on log-AUC, and they are disconnected from the pharmacokinetics (PK) literature. However, the observations from a bioavailability/bioequivalence study are the correlated concentrations, not the AUCs. Thus, the estimate of AUC and the related variance estimate may not be accurate because of the exclusion of the correlation nature. In this paper, based on the predicted concentrations from a functional linear model which takes into consideration of the correlation structure of concentrations, a residual analysis is proposed to detect the outliers. With this approach, the distributional assumption is on the observed raw concentration instead of the summarized parameter AUC, and this approach takes the repeated measurements nature of the concentration curve into consideration, which is in line with population PK concept and could result in a more accurate variance estimate. A real data set is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.","inCitations":["790c174b70ff1c79d93edc9e4adceaf234251a12","7b3c3f7dc85ac94baab6904c33e447f2a7176fab","151523ae68ff588c95893ed7ebf0aa66c77b621d","016392df8bcd727fb739f42e1075e6687cfa59d2"],"title":"A new approach for outliers in a bioavailability/bioequivalence study.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701199528"}

The performance of the proposed procedure is investigated via Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical comparisons indicate that it outperforms existing ones substantially, resulting in significant improvements in explained variability and prediction error. Applying these methods to CAMP, we are able to find a number of potentially important genetic mutations related to lung function, several of which exhibit interesting nonlinear patterns around puberty.","inCitations":["f1ff8e83e2c91c3b0fcaa4a4a6d8f576668c2058","8afc3ebacc515d8f395fc0c80d0c1e573773f587","1c4946f78d7766a823556aa2e033ce267286b6b6","157945782688013dbcabf5ec207c5be6a888eb0f","8fe7a95f7440e09367c4cd6c1e04baf0f2c56b13","ca87e521518127336dc79f869d0f64f8b27bd5a6","48e9d4a12964b034db14b8173c0b9e8acfdd7342","e3844c1e5a20780952b2a45f6f0625360cfcae38","c454c69cfd9a9ba0425251bd6be3a7d07e027a94","ae125d6b72323726c28a216314f9bd8b40b39f48","4d607aca1dfffec0f5bcf675df176b88c5b40b12","4c5747a8f905cebd9f81b362f325bc5ac8831ec0","064eeada44eb0accea85c5e8c946ee9c8b95c56c","1a88fe4823fd1446c99282398dc8afb41bb918c5"],"title":"Feature Screening for Time-varying Coefficient Models with Ultrahigh Dimensional Longitudinal Data.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS912"}

PeT effects are more individualized than conditional treatment effects from a randomized setting with the same observed characteristics. PeT effects can be easily aggregated to construct any of the mean treatment effect parameters and, more importantly, are well suited to comprehend individual-level treatment effect heterogeneity. The paper presents the theory behind PeT effects, and applies it to study the variation in individual-level comparative effects of prostate cancer treatments on overall survival and costs.","inCitations":["cda88e649851702f1727fd21c16abdc8e13dec14","b85bfd3b55aa271676af63b905cf612a1f4917a9","fc0c84efdc200d80f3074d9c7ae624a14ec62a5c","f976dd9438706f9b7990b14208daea5b8b87e80d","cf134792924bb8b28a99bad70b524843c73251bc","cd046d2bf526d217d8e0d7c621c26d26a6aac629","877e3003c21ed5b4106320f37ec883576111f5ac","0e28cd3f243c2750a11aced853c6b410e7b9e600","4450b963edf5b87e9c1044c13ba93e6b8d6d775e","0188b51b91853af0edf9e1b28f9f57779f127085","6f9b3974f0b431771218cd7f464fcb6964aa2fa5","068e9ccf21943c89609ddf2042d53ae9064d8fa1","591d9324e4e1b9740ab049d61919d0f6f559e827","02b0618106b774833ad2438e2fc57181ed98ea07","4cf34827ca81b05e08eb7fe0b075933d51598ad0","5de4703776d7be0a17f10fdec2ff56d92fa7eeae","63204086253669e924709801aae74e614c8dbc34","1457ee4b9313a1ba226fe6e9f12c35ca5e19237b","05108a66c8a061f1e6263820dbdc877d6bad3050","87a6c8c42e4886f2ed4733a2ad22370889d68a54","c791f227d773ee8b86eff5c4530913561e257108","8a91c939c1a421d4d726b89fe85e7c47526c34a8","9fb1b7d38f7ad699345f60ece7cfda171b788871"],"title":"ESTIMATING PERSON-CENTERED TREATMENT (PeT) EFFECTS USING INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES: AN APPLICATION TO EVALUATING PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENTS.","doi":"10.1002/jae.2343"}

Maximum likelihood estimates are consistent when data are missing at random (MAR) but, as this assumption is not checkable, pattern mixture models (PMM) have been developed to deal with informative dropout. More recently, latent class models (LCM) have been proposed as a way to relax PMM assumptions. The aim of this paper is to compare PMM and LCM in order to tackle informative dropout in a longitudinal study of cognitive ageing measured by several psychometric tests. Using a multivariate longitudinal model with a latent process, a sensitivity analysis was performed to compare estimates under the MAR assumption, from a PMM and from two LCM. In the PMM, dropout patterns are included as covariates in the multivariate longitudinal model. In the simple LCM, they are predictors of the class membership probabilities while, in the joint LCM, the dropout time is jointly modeled using a proportional hazard model depending on latent classes. We show that parameter interpretation is different in the two kinds of models and thus can lead to different estimated values. PMM parameters are adjusted on the dropout patterns while LCM parameters are adjusted on the latent classes.

A problem of considerable interest is that of estimating the \"Transcription Regulation Networks\" (TRN) relating the TFs and genes. While the expression levels of genes can be observed, the activation levels of the corresponding TFs are usually unknown, greatly increasing the difficulty of the problem. Based on previous experimental work, it is often the case that partial information about the TRN is available. For example, certain TFs may be known to regulate a given gene or in other cases a connection may be predicted with a certain probability. In general, the biology of the problem indicates there will be very few connections between TFs and genes. Several methods have been proposed for estimating TRNs. However, they all suffer from problems such as unrealistic assumptions about prior knowledge of the network structure or computational limitations. We propose a new approach that can directly utilize prior information about the network structure in conjunction with observed gene expression data to estimate the TRN. Our approach uses L(1) penalties on the network to ensure a sparse structure. This has the advantage of being computationally efficient as well as making many fewer assumptions about the network structure. We use our methodology to construct the TRN for E. coli and show that the estimate is biologically sensible and compares favorably with previous estimates.","inCitations":["af5a1dc00496c0fec5ec8428a65ab9425e0e52be","da2da46fd3e898b17105d08ba270881fc52c88a3","6ee5224987dc0b053d4497f21548687660b7f066","04db21467f051d8d02759617d0bda11a731bc01b","e155f33ae7c0bf0b628ca3afb3065e808b8bf5ee","a62c47cc8957d81e6e13c2cab48577d46bd41e0d","daf6657ed98c5b8bab13659c877d548456194c70","012d731edd0a1222f2f259ebf1d9ff2e308853ee","603e7c634213b33a763d44d7e6f44be33c36bd58","7f8caa7cab1089e9aca9ac384a866fa45271a298"],"title":"Sparse Regulatory Networks.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS350"}

Here we consider a commonly encountered situation in practice, when analyzing data from observational cohorts, that there are auxiliary variables which affect both the treatment and the outcome, yet these variables are not of primary interest to be included in a generalizable treatment strategy. Furthermore, there is not enough prior knowledge of the effect of the treatments or of the importance of the covariates for us to explicitly specify the dependency between the outcome and different covariates, thus we choose a model that is flexible enough to accommodate the possibly complex association of the outcome on the covariates. We consider observational studies with a survival outcome and propose to use Random Survival Forest with Weighted Bootstrap (RSFWB) to model the counterfactual outcomes while marginalizing over the auxiliary covariates. By maximizing the restricted mean survival time, we estimate the optimal regime for a target population based on a selected set of covariates. Simulation studies illustrate that the proposed method performs reliably across a range of different scenarios. We further apply RSFWB to a prostate cancer study.","inCitations":["17d61d3119d868ab27e9789b5a9fef4303386ae8","b40988e7ff0fb007409e80b81331403fbec5b145"],"title":"Estimating the Optimal Personalized Treatment Strategy Based on Selected Variables to Prolong Survival via Random Survival Forest with Weighted Bootstrap.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1380036"}

The two one-sided tests procedure (TOST, or the 90% confidence interval approach) has been used as the mainstream methodology to test average BE (ABE) on pharmacokinetic parameters such as the area under the blood concentration-time curve and the peak concentration. However, for highly variable drugs (%CV > 30%), it is difficult to demonstrate ABE in a standard cross-over study with the typical number of subjects using the TOST because of lack of power. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency recommended similar but not identical reference-scaled average BE (RSABE) approaches to address this issue. Although the power is improved, the new approaches may not guarantee a high level of confidence for the true difference between two drugs at the ABE boundaries. It is also difficult for these approaches to address the issues of population BE (PBE) and individual BE (IBE). We advocate the use of a likelihood approach for representing and interpreting BE data as evidence. Using example data from a full replicate 2 × 4 cross-over study, we demonstrate how to present evidence using the profile likelihoods for the mean difference and standard deviation ratios of the two drugs for the pharmacokinetic parameters. With this approach, we present evidence for PBE and IBE as well as ABE within a unified framework. Our simulations show that the operating characteristics of the proposed likelihood approach are comparable with the RSABE approaches when the same criteria are applied.","inCitations":["32232707e3b85379136519b0b53c6997f96620f6"],"title":"Likelihood approach for evaluating bioequivalence of highly variable drugs.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1661"}

In this paper, we relax the stationarity restriction on the model, and allow that the regressors are generated by a general Harris recurrent Markov process which includes both the stationary (positive recurrent) and nonstationary (null recurrent) cases. Under some mild conditions, we establish the asymptotic theory for the proposed local polynomial CQR estimator of the mean regression function, and show that the convergence rate for the estimator in nonstationary case is slower than that in stationary case. Furthermore, a weighted type local polynomial CQR estimator is provided to improve the estimation efficiency, and a data-driven bandwidth selection is introduced to choose the optimal bandwidth involved in the nonparametric estimators. Finally, we give some numerical studies to examine the finite sample performance of the developed methodology and theory.","inCitations":["72ca84a0840e1787815f497de594e85707392a9a","c32fd5d79194d9f85093af4ba405815b84a3c189"],"title":"Local Composite Quantile Regression Smoothing for Harris Recurrent Markov Processes.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.04.002"}

The robustness of the method is tested using real and simulated data sets.","inCitations":["00681aa9295f34e8dac6c8dff664498a3546ec78","b70feaddc7d63cad8b7ccefff14a273e5d3145df","8e6ea7b70c36029cf72cec7de69893bf0831ce60","567768d77d5769b85d9dbc2fde470d7232c46b6e","d855de57481bf36381150a53384f04702e436835","cfc0aa1a7262d7ac2ab1fd5c72bb695b40bc0b51","947be34633eb483e0bd33613b4e8d0fe28d52e51"],"title":"Robust Logistic and Probit Methods for Binary and Multinomial Regression.","doi":"10.4172/2155-6180.1000202"}

The PPC method is employed as an alternative to standard goodness-of-fit tests which are of limited use even when the number of items to be ranked is small. Several test quantities are formed to assess the fit of the Case V ranking model to data for various sample sizes and for two types of violations of the Case V assumptions: heterogeneous stimulus variances and rankers from different populations. The study concludes that the PPC method is useful in detecting local and global misfits of a Thurstonian Case V model, even when the ranking data are sparse.","inCitations":["a279bea6c7a4c3e795573c66088d3bd00a71b830","10daa574f0750ff12b60d5b8deee375723deeb81","ece7dd801792289039d806ae641288471d076310","f6cd85409548f170ec586b60f26ec2f9bdf29039"],"title":"Testing Thurstonian Case V ranking models using posterior predictive checks.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159330"}
