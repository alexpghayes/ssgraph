For small sample sizes especially, likelihood-based inference can be unreliable with variance components being particularly difficult to estimate. A Bayesian approach is appealing but has been hampered by the lack of a fast implementation, and the difficulty in specifying prior distributions with variance components again being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly review previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples, carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated spline model for which we examine our prior specification in terms of the implied degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference is now practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies may be less accurate for such data.","inCitations":["70248509b525fd3568c9637a20fd6c6a0a3d4027","1b1f3c68584028c5df4894cefd3472106e19cf1d","25e83e43b732fb5477565fa3289fd981563a4a20","f3257d04ac5b73fa15eeeab93827b1abc3ed23e7","6f262307b8cd6b4ec3028d634c1e0545f8dda747","54c15875f9037b724913dddc706494ff196b7f84","c0e5ed323e19dbd2613dc6c89660db2743b17daa","9f46b5215f247519b058d0f8ebdb9535cf807328","5c7c5472f3ab85d1f670960e3458a44bf2f1e973","a7f1eb7728d5e51d4bf331fa225baaf7b6b47845","6e21a7079825b0d6e87782da6851325829123952","bb1baf348a5789cbc109df5c3e1b399ebab35ab6","0006fc0ebd459034acce91c82964299849550aa0","b714f454f5ced4141b095b447e187fba88345fa2","0181599c84400d7c39a0950d943c2bf0ecb8ad4e","dec463d2855f58ac4404c4ba4a126461e3ea24c5","b1e484302f73f7c017ef0549154cdef08c018598","6ce469af3a682659968f6e845b2ff591f03e6089","e7e972b4aec0788a500ea86f5617254503e49c67","9d40970b4d3287ad3b0f5292d7bdea723a573354","9475374e355aa395d385492abd7b65ba441d7c23","5ef65b2eb0fab007d03e039b6f14270549528d92","a7e267048b04aa82be4d69eabc342864397bf3d5","2a3adba1027e89843ca7bb90657a75dccc96e21b","bed48ca0a719297bd2ff684a4897ebab23ce53df","152ed0dde23d8eca081a95cd83f781d16646d0c4","613fe4575a125ab1343f6f3d254fcc8ac6dbd8b5","384ce554cbe1e30a42aa12a84bdaad342bdef239","c2f9bfd3f44560c402f503b9aa5b8b85115ea061","fdf1c0bcce28e84451f9f2d1134265ecbb5ec6ca","ebdc5582f882175a8244a1b7f1b52c20b9a4324e","98a3a16bd1193681c92608e78be40166800149ba","7d5394672f8cf021f4be2d115b4adb93049902f3","f9d4d7096f616075802c9fdf957e90f3b6bb001f","bc19e854a3bcd3e8d6f01e073ff14926d8087eb0","f2846e28259ceedd06f3c4f69e6b81ddce229212","a5a7435f859c91af4ba3419424aae9c627f76c0c","258844ee4449e04603b0c94e6f004f6640e57967","4abfe9748e79bbdde12e6bfebfdc3eabbcf74ead","26524f7728caf149182a613557fed122b4a1e326","c51ab8a6c3b13d006e2651969a3e0fdd2d01b142","2af4ebe7cfd335157978c99be7369900607cec7e","6ab426f5ee2165a3bb170e883817cabaabe5348a","0377cb6b581381ff321e7fb42d49a8d27732620c","450f838aff85c6c8764c35a2617c24e1657a822d","155b79a6996fcdbcceda01bb78ce3878a38d7acf","2762285b52eddd52917d3c0b015a94e097f7e267","7f327157fc7c024e1a891081d2bd79176796263b","e4a5cec85258bbef1f1f6c329ba8afe3e91c0d95","6e0a6a10075f37d7552b00ac901e48bf5d5f8528","72dd9add82414923a3416fed01a80dcf4dcf11ba","f5a8cef6c4e69fd894f31bf192372e47e73de1fa","5c412289902ebd7c12650abf6a174f682d41783a","b64887d6026b7dd5f45dcf031dac6d7d8e9496ea","f808abe293362e36240e1f2082077d25c6700dc4","06bfff629e94e3117c3c7ecd1a0ececea9884f13","f72ad89efed03cf89893ef2f6bf7ad9cc76693e2","d55ed71053a72e1d4675f5c3eaa1be89eec4f06e","f4522b1f4099dc0a927a284ea59c4a1f38b703ad","be563817cbc8cabd455a45f55cc5d12ca985fd01","ab2c2b2c3c294b4e85962ed855f386004a3439dc","281dad648077adfa89d6d5e302e656790de19c7b","138c4967ea1d0bdb9cc2958a29eabf7a87a1a142","af911a99c72093fcd8458d0bbde042d42ac5a6b3","006579b23041e06dba88a67e995cc7e4769c3388","036ca6cb845e54749246ab1a463dcac1f78998c2","c3e058247e399849bbdd99dd42f668498c17957e","91ae6714d892cd212a59e7afae0b9ee4c959578e","023208d3fcfba3f6a116cbfa092201b96c4907d4","9dcf8fcdfd1a065ff91e747c54928eb65fe40e8b","32fd929dfb8b0e5eb86adc1b62d0b1308666b67b","edda02426a16ba216fe787f66ee1214d62831e46","9ece183770ca221c4cd4cd897aa52c3bff5f9a37","397195ee484788e631ff1113fd2236400d4ca683","270f02d2d32deb1d372615fce201f23b9783d694","b77f0abcb7e1146a215b4dc592409c0465b25985","9b160677d69cac05329b81764c01d56c7806c953","92d0d3beef6313e40b71a735d27a913d9afa9387","f1882c510e7df7c756c40b4857e020332a4a027c","2f946ec79912033fd455952db0fba13e03bd1fbd","486798690e0466de135ecb9c5e0a73d32419184d","3a83688ab14d2c03cdb99b8fb9da94ec6b27f96a","67bede4a989d2020911305c8a88db2f6596aad58","d773f2257da9c5a46b91f3009a6fd52def13d95b","2d2cfb6ba06d3e98d89e9e2946aa62d248205db3","094e0288f663ab0a2d31bfa33e7aa69fd7e44cbf","7854105de46d7874d2859220bc07a9a8ec087e7c","5a999dd44a64774179d1e1199876419bb7a26760","8b569da15441bfb0381049c6e3a32f828e9f0ce9","55c8be0cbe6dbfdb458fba5dbf8f581f86ef9e8a","9c604c6e624f537f299626ec063fcf7c41e9b79f","fe0ed43ceedd174832a479668df01ad03b73bd5d","2463ac5c023e3d9b4ff525924a38815e7ffe3c47","4f224cbde2a70b4b0925e7d32c0ffd2ed8eb6407","c791d0fb4ed0471311b9aa64d0f8495f2f43fae0","db5ed765e709b7feb71bd1c813d1b0a2bb412574","7ccc6e0ea855ece6c4384752f07ea017689ecbe8","5e8a2b2e79b29406b87342137891d15fddc3d522","6896221f86cd4b15da0730acbb16ddf887753629","cf68296fe08a87b2d6a58397d81dd44e60b43f77","501c4e3661e673e4ba7c61b43ccfdb3594ff11e7","9862f040b74d9861a96352712178ee2db9d6b222","e368750f2d23c88c28b22c9f02a0203bbd7d141d","47c5ab7e53030096f64b9745a9443f9b001e8682","3c9c4282fc932a820338f0597fcecd7569190553","693b1e8c1d726f6cfee9f4afe8097b9b0d3a4528","06f3d7880ad85bc9a580f18420be1124016ac752","2087938489a025c6b752c087645de9d6953cdd9e","3b467b280da0a5a6df5782a56a6773842a19e721","bf20e94960a14b0577876a3ca0774cdbc2293cc1","e4b4041b3ce00abd0cb3cbaf84c2625527c1bcab","da4cf6992517af6a4e700c67c887c2ced48f1fbf","3f3ad7983c2944225539f5987967ef20d33b80d3","e1fa3f46c27dd36d5b72fad867cbe0fc4451b9fd","b7d09e3b8af4a435b3fa9bcdd12d943dcab96854","fa8edcd720931829168d34542b2dcc71

The genetic architecture of each phenotype may be complex, and poorly estimated genetic architectures may compromise the inference of causal relationships among phenotypes. Existing methods assume QTLs are known or inferred without regard to the phenotype network structure. In this paper we develop a QTL-driven phenotype network method (QTLnet) to jointly infer a causal phenotype network and associated genetic architecture for sets of correlated phenotypes. Randomization of alleles during meiosis and the unidirectional influence of genotype on phenotype allow the inference of QTLs causal to phenotypes. Causal relationships among phenotypes can be inferred using these QTL nodes, enabling us to distinguish among phenotype networks that would otherwise be distribution equivalent. We jointly model phenotypes and QTLs using homogeneous conditional Gaussian regression models, and we derive a graphical criterion for distribution equivalence. We validate the QTLnet approach in a simulation study. Finally, we illustrate with simulated data and a real example how QTLnet can be used to infer both direct and indirect effects of QTLs and phenotypes that co-map to a genomic region.","inCitations":["810b4eb5de42094b006af5d8a88819b3d81b337f","1ebf25a96a3ecb30008d4419682db6498d7c0f30","2916c78876cebccab42d8e29ab7d73b2d7517276","6489bcb76d823e20c44d428c147f0dd8a5cdaa00","d6e4aed61735742f7b1fba8615cac1c691624dfe","336ddbe32db932828a26c1878cc76ca6dcbb8474","a058da3a15ff8347b617fbec57d5178a93990531","ae75db44824b0d58b01cdd5c512108e232ebed11","314eca5521a154fe18924362502f0f1e1090bdd1","f7f8b7230fe603ca02fb02388dbdf9bab6eabdd5","604c6c36830903e28e6d53a98734ee3940dfb6df","ed6ab9c967530353618c0f6cdf894bb23b79cee2","bcb4efdaf254cf3e8bb2f36f7d399a4c5e46fb9a","e91890597e7fb5d22435412c34989a738425bb01","edd8bd424237288d0cdd3d2cc5592558bbc32c28","94ae52fe9fd8db16d5540318de004e3d8850356a","9d64d1ae8980ca7445c39eac274940c2d5d82709","423ee341652d9990ffc40de0c27a28cd4aaff5a1","fe3024b78a146a1d0ed7dc2ac4cd78957f58c680","e86fe9b56bac5e159a1b18d9e5003ec06cd14314","b068f111b4b7f436bb99b945e3191d8061fe531b","ed10e94ff3e6674dbf905114036e34bb9bd59e1b","a9e71e69c52630454111d1d852d358ad98b561c8","b78571aaa3906e38b3fb9d71176d96ffe46d3497","8edfb17da16e7395000cc491418d5c5a0911aafc","fbc9c57976fc3e3e8b99eb436c107fc29f491210","7fd4f8e9167677ce2e062d36dd912df345427bd5","4cce131b0c8b20051451296708615ea245032edf","8740f943c40c4f37ede6fc34ecf38ef40c7ef199","786f2005b8f4715a36706eb6288d07dd85c8f37c","fe5fa066271a1873819b797cadb8fda7fc794b54","f44c3e5f863cfcb232c2923ceee22860bb2ce757","63b202082c4d8055bb607ac0da88266e2093dc0b","37a79a05a6f09b27af8b4c1b20701c40385b5f3c","c9aabd348759f9d6460badba492612d405e2ff6c","7710b482b5956665598c0b8ca4c2cb37555287aa","ffa45e40aed6cadb03c6749eb72c72156f57e512","320227e1a754d692215235117589b9ebc780c761","e652255e7aceaf773ece843af76018229f82532d","55ef4e419087424d649d199cd551fd09f8930f97","408d2f2971112651eaee03529c39792088f90b97","15c210e734b319bef26f645fc3764cbc21eeaf54","39face926e85af988559ddfe63344bbd5d9e3091","b447ccce330d2f7865d3b2e6f69e026cf24b9df3","e407932a03ee45a7bad33ca3ad7b3d0b0f751a4c","1e1e196fbf3c36deba2e850be8962fc843a573c5","8fc1d380d4aa32501f5b9b2bcd4240a63cfe6c12","e095eae1aa43311be151a2c959ed62d61baadf42","e3bfe8cc7b9514bd592d94bb15898606b67b7d15","f5f4036e062793e5da8863f1a55c46fc59263b87","d3e6fa23c1a916bbf1f02fd333584becf4d7ee2e","2826a6e28f7fec465b7533e0f86a04cbfa3f9d0d","97145bc16391d6a9e9cd6da64266b18daf2f0c45","54a51dd998a16a06162956d38c9a13501fadeeef","51edd84aa03882ff5ff3eb62cc96d59d1bba3305","63efded68ebb397719ad29fe771b9258fc99789a","a2dded66aad5b49edc79327a5f2854f9ba3d7c9a","40a7d0a53acd7aea179dd6a309c15289f36a726c","c89df91f82f9f68d3511cc40a4161d28b2373e2d","bfc5c9389ad648c3111f3921c46a186ba791dc4a","a162e000ad027de21ce9ca7e92f6d21028a201ce","8ad0766a86582cdcadf32257353b5f2d848cfd96","af5b4241b6dc1ae5ee7b9c95e5affc894e06e3a4","2b1e7ef69cf6319cf98be8bdd401f52413b736f8","c27b4982e42d1c4b054336b7baa91f12e81f38de","d89e378ebc9f0b327fa532e158507e8f002a2630"],"title":"Causal Graphical Models in Systems Genetics: a Unified Framework for Joint Inference of Causal Network and Genetic Architecture for Correlated Phenotypes.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS288"}

The stepwise approach starts with the assessment of analytical similarity of critical quality attributes (CQAs) for structural/physicochemical and functional properties in the manufacturing process of biosimilar products. For Tier 1 CQAs which are most relevant to clinical outcomes, the FDA recommends an equivalence test be performed for similarity assessment based on an equivalence acceptance criterion (EAC). While performing the equivalence test, sample size is a critical component of the equivalence test. This article focuses on the discussion of the FDA's proposal: select an appropriate sample size by adjusting EAC margin and variability ([Formula: see text]). The article provides a thorough discussion on the FDA's proposal; sample size requirement under different scenarios are briefly described and a numerical study which compares sample size requirement under various combinations of study parameters is conducted.","inCitations":["38d46c9c4a64fb1a0a2bf90436f89a4162ce2d45"],"title":"On sample size requirement for analytical similarity assessment.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2018.1437171"}

Furthermore, the failure time of interest may be related to the cluster size. For example, Williamson et al. (2008) discussed such an example arising from a lymphatic filariasis study. A simple and common approach to the analysis of these data is to simplify or convert interval-censored data to right-censored data due to the lack of proper inference procedures for direct analysis of these data. In this paper, two procedures are presented for regression analysis of clustered failure time data that allow both interval censoring and informative cluster size. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the presented approaches and they are applied to a motivating example.","inCitations":["ce4dd42db38dec3229bde860ac4c14cb85befb39","a77cb01dcd319688a6ee2de6cbb859b6084fe499","7b7f5d7ed598a5f19ca9d2fa6c1531f14fc7a3a2","a8dd72f8c42a459116f4eeecb3aa51e2db3e2ba6","43504edee7a47931a3453dede1b38e8ce49a05ab","c5489cdaa287d717ad5acdee2e5c6fd887caf5d0","5eecb7bea260b4dd42c913585bcf0e13248bd68d","b88104fa69de68004496e3355b087a42fcac73f5"],"title":"Regression analysis of clustered interval-censored failure time data with informative cluster size","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2010.01.035"}

Nevertheless, existing gene selection methods for microarray classification cannot identify which classes are discriminable by these selected genes. In this paper, we propose an improved linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method that simultaneously selects important genes and identifies the discriminable classes. Specifically, a pairwise fusion penalty for LDA was used to shrink the differences of the class centroids in pairs for each variable and fuse the centroids of indiscriminable classes altogether. The numerical results in analyzing 2 gene expression profiles demonstrate the proposed approach help improve the interpretation of important genes in microarray classification problems.","inCitations":["f9dc72c722e1f30c6bdc5d035711c13de2e062e5","85c0efdb8e5ad47e8fb9848499ca75b06953c17d","c06563398377b2636d1fde256d529639fa734459","6ceac3360a1d246dfcdd88105f71fc4f82ade2b1","77e0fc9eba26ac7ce9b9b012f9216cff4ca533bc","0e6a6871c1f70dfee4302d1747489d026b2e1e60","4d8ac42e5d4b0f2e76f15d625966b722bf351cdb","9f2a51a6a02d3c691770f966188a6786c3959066","66112f92c52cde13376f791d0b44643c34522316","1f1b1c535c5e41d4adbd013ced74ce5fa26cabbf"],"title":"Simultaneous variable selection and class fusion for high-dimensional linear discriminant analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq023"}

The key innovation is a Metropolis-Hastings method for the time series of state variables based on sequential approximation of filtering and smoothing densities using normal mixtures. These mixtures are propagated through the non-linearities using an accurate, local mixture approximation method, and we use a regenerating procedure to deal with potential degeneracy of mixture components. This provides accurate, direct approximations to sequential filtering and retrospective smoothing distributions, and hence a useful construction of global Metropolis proposal distributions for simulation of posteriors for the set of states.

Influential cases or outliers can lead to inappropriate solutions and problematic conclusions in structural equation modelling. By giving a proper weight to each case, the influence of outliers on a robust procedure can be minimized. We propose using a robust procedure as a transformation technique, generating a new data matrix that can be analysed by a variety of multivariate methods. Mardia's multivariate skewness and kurtosis statistics are used to measure the effect of the transformation in achieving approximate normality. Since the transformation makes the data approximately normal, applying a classical normal theory based procedure to the transformed data gives more efficient parameter estimates. Three procedures for parameter evaluation and model testing are discussed. Six examples illustrate the various aspects with the robust transformation.","inCitations":["191e7f8943d45c15d23ee410962f865e5169449c","4353e51af1c2d04b8063b5ed8d817380f7ab2298","37e841a6fe16ec1332762b335f1448dc58e490c2","dd7bd10193ca2eb375d88c7a7acd07dc9f27a3eb","1a783430807050489c88637a42ec89278f453257","4c604ed6b8f917f5de5e5ae38302327d2dc2c930","57b5b73ba0669a56b9e16fff8db02b91209af892","239da75a2e7c80bf4b312d7f7c0a6bc4ad4c58ee","2009701fbae5440d84b4d799728abe2d016f70de","3beffe8ba5916c82253849bae3dcb376a2b7d8ae","0b8e75f12ad308df8ed7c351ef472854b35c0323","54653de3245b2a1e5db493c035fc7627a157e0e9","85ef6ad9edb266b984f7e185db3653ff81ef5027","15177738f125248d22c657382efa6a4f8dfb1a2f","3227db4327c4d7f73b26815ac6bad6e19d5ea263","810cb842cdf2e0c471efc5e9004b2eb666bec8c7","46ffabc5fa3012ab9c7413efa5ce144d2b7ba7d8","faf63349439c31171633d6a975902ca8cd27c7fe","3d64362f705d1f4773abb35328d4237c9cb61619","fc76ce2d44adef80b38cf972b1a67079d1b95760","a7d206522491b979ae0dddc5c223389d8a240b35","00ca70b29e3f23b74f7c438cc00a84edbb4039ec","ab0c1ec621636414e3bbdc2a966083ce60e5316f","f790ee904a95b41297628d8049defbb80a3919c4","c95a5fa1c1ded4131d0fe5b3178cf3f9b05301a1","e8ca4925461da00a00736d86b85564a0ad6832c4","0111c0b20044abeddd853e80aaa82b47154737f9","47c2f53834c06de5bada901f9ebb2abc733b6215","dd23451482f9d17011fd63fa46d31b5f967ea20a","cfabcc62b52447789e7277dbd737846a5d9a7ba4","f66ac36afe4faaf243b3c208f668c36fed37e2eb","1373050d2a45548680259063bb0d5f6047e5c3dd","b2e5a89b744bb9615791485bb436170aaea39709","4d1194bbf8192002b67bbf147a6e422fec7f8f7b","50f2aa6c6cbf2ef933f4e2859d03f6e80edb2840","b6b3fb95899c7cee0a9ec3d97bca0638cdaa59d0","3a10a05afabe82648c47fbb81e84f9818b7fc685","3853debc7787a5cff94afa35481cc345c32a7e15","6195bc8c416637406197854bc1b47c4595abd9b2","9d6a2510e61e0b8c1b680cb5eea189cbb8f062d7","27e0e266c2c149d28ce22e7322713b8b3c68c636","e1b61f5f6883a4443d753522f3096e0113fb87ca","61d9c5559c2f03e6af7268b919039c2493fc9999","09c0820d6fff34538b829f1abb6898cf5f1c3400","3a3f0e3ef37d7c7eecd4a3b198e923d2b29470e3","6bf9fe1ca72c32f6be5f8118922f19144e531224"],"title":"Robust transformation with applications to structural equation modelling.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159169"}

Generally, these requirements involve a compound hypothesis with multiple comparisons. The min test has been shown to be an optimal alpha-level test for testing a single combination drug. Analysis procedures in a multiple-dose, combination-drug study have typically involved classical ANOVA models or multiple regression models in a response surface methodology (RSM) framework. An inferential procedure based on an ANOVA model uses a screening test to address multiple comparison issues and multiple min tests to explicitly identify combinations satisfying regulatory requirements. An exploratory procedure based on RSM modeling is used to build a segmented linear model and a stairstep linear model to describe dose-response relationships. The two procedures are mutually supportive of one another in providing a broader assurance in the identification of effective combinations.","inCitations":["01bbfc97bfb0808a12412478c523c36036b3a5f9","4733f05d21f4a5f55bb8a08d4a450b8132942f78"],"title":"The analysis of a multiple-dose, combination-drug clinical trial using response surface methodology.","doi":"10.1080/10543409208835030"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Development of anti-cancer therapies usually involve small to moderate size studies to provide initial estimates of response rates before initiating larger studies to better quantify response. These early trials often each contain a single tumor type, possibly using other stratification factors. Response rate for a given tumor type is routinely reported as the percentage of patients meeting a clinical criteria (e.g. tumor shrinkage), without any regard to response in the other studies. These estimates (called maximum likelihood estimates or MLEs) on average approximate the true value, but have variances that are usually large, especially for small to moderate size studies. The approach presented here is offered as a way to improve overall estimation of response rates when several small trials are considered by reducing the total uncertainty.The shrinkage estimators considered here (James-Stein/empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes) are alternatives that use information from all studies to provide potentially better estimates for each study. While these estimates introduce a small bias, they have a considerably smaller variance, and thus tend to be better in terms of total mean squared error. These procedures provide a better view of drug performance in that group of tumor types as a whole, as opposed to estimating each response rate individually without consideration of the others. In technical terms, the vector of estimated response rates is nearer the vector of true values, on average, than the vector of the usual unbiased MLEs applied to such trials.","inCitations":["2b39016abf1242aa175925895b996cb173fdf20a"],"title":"Combining estimates from multiple early studies to obtain estimates of response: using shrinkage estimates to obtain estimates of response.","doi":"10.1002/pst.245"}

We introduce an iterative nonparametric kernel estimator. We also extend the estimation method to the case of a semiparametric partially linear fixed effects model. To determine whether a parametric, semiparametric or nonparametric model is appropriate, we propose test statistics to test between the three alternatives in practice. We further propose a test statistic for testing the null hypothesis of random effects against fixed effects in a nonparametric panel data regression model. Simulations are used to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators and the test statistics.","inCitations":["40c241ca74b861c494cf208e2da8764229f0ec5d","f2e0f8802d90dbdbdc480e4762663e7c845eaeea","8cea1794d937436b0b34a9f4a53adf452dd36ca6","5eb227da69427959d4f4daa925a982e3ae84b948","1ecd1e8eb14da5a1ba4f0b18eca7555f9259aa43","249465b106c4ad3f3d938d8be39a27133861feb2","af8c30903f0b6eaf8d2f6380dc5af430d8864e87","bb53b84524783782c6c45dc84039a63b6a262d22","9ccaa8a8960af43ed6f34143b48bed18890f11f8","335b193b36a8ce1916135e699ba5305c9e228c15","3af6bcdbf2a4946481d33935f39314ffe6da5ecb","7bff08fb9c7b887dbdae0ad3bd6b36d37faa4f26","1783e549e9b46e5390f768cef59c7edc0932b4b0","07999e3872dce23a69b42f113037e4835ca40ff1","bc67eae085d794d821b497e5750d55b24b50d7bb","164489486ba9e9abe2d4f761e171b861ac99f3dc","372af712fdcda4c235f1b8664d69a58d6aa4973a","bee1875f37f4d11e27c11717534fa5976f013b0e","a4bc95d7bd49ffe52886101b0a2bb6f96a0b8d9a","a966ff3ca23378555749621e06b4798c658479c1","6cb72ccadd274d7f10b0a88e4cc029f76780e75c","c50fa30589b802a0f5c61d63f8a8b28e5151ce7e","3b22b4850580dbb209553088e347ea8ef8442fb6","b3f58eae8254c9df90d342f9940231c36dcde85c","9b550fd1c8e66920d923ff59f4221f0679eb7d68","6821b99cfca2842a7cb56c3f622c099e764cccf9","7331acf0eb2b833dee3449c4d607c4a39c926080","d41874d8d26f9543468dfce9fc15ecdb58662e0b","a2277cdec8b899346cc500cc23d1f97a16ddc4dc","6f4a3927b20d80e6632a1bdaa8be2e6d66cdd3f0","c91567426aa69ee03c633e1a6e101488b659243d","729fc14f54570a3957b8656a375a21c146a4d25e","bba584be3cd8031598c155461982775df43a46a7","c729183e06e484d892758a822c5f3deae4b755c9","b9939fe2afc685612e0b71277a4a22ac6c0dac0f","d6bb1019b57807479b75d1d3913506dcc26c1258","ab6608624d294c7742e89bbbd5fed08f07ce5d65","f14a704c47760d7df73a3540cdbafda972e87c75","62043520e7a0c2ec348594e50519f6abb7403bdf","3ac0d9b0477736ddc94d76446f58fbecc59ee218","f1f06e48b2472c8bac6fed27c81715eb272e871e","4ce5e7c947785994823d111f0128131425bcc63f","8b1a8b77fafae1db7996cde150baeecd527e3f71","67c8797434488972a06cf5bfeb41bd7c42e3190d","8857ceaad336ebdbd8b5e13c8188c71639bee3b6","816de85c76b2d0af05345b883039e1129e573da1","bdd211852c1c5249ffe572fc22b40f78b48d01da","009d575c647cffbb790f5efa48836c963da0b9b7","b655047d3f3fa59262ad74f32c87656816266119","5cf4cebc5095679b5f024a79906d30aafba0adb2","e6df1c48b6dca2bde243a8ac0bd615c058bc4ac3","2cab30e3cd1a0f3752cd400aa2c6ed4e375e7f48","dbf4b140cabd294c36b8bc0388ee79bad17b28cf","2887ced1b2f42119e6fca3fafbd5a2465103c531","d9904160fb60d0db85c517406da656b57d944e25","4ea0d00771c73b81a753559c7bf423863fd72361","8997bd57d40432502db943f74ebd368d900b8dbf","1b641efd27ef44ebd8769421cd10c4f61623f925","e5229e749dedc32fde79eaae714486b9172e9574","c66b199a8ae545f2d7f5d56a2262b80e7a1bff65","05986d09e564a7b39458b1c7268f196fdcb90479","7dbfd5b347022df7d80a83a3eeb1e9d9699d1b9b","06b11e3a1052ea905f12149966195099211b8867","e399f80c48f20f580164013fca76bcce894ce95f","ffa814987d4b0b4eac7e605b282d0e0412f0e87b","06b8e7b77823146b01596175bf471900eb9285b6","013d2a7af366684290be734267e66a803e93a856","64d5ded1886ca370baa20a74df8e5015a109cfdc","175ac099fa05fa96d0cbaa94ef9adb46531fa54c","e8bf2d92f73202232da1bce557b858d4f6d95209","61d02ccf16e4e7973100310f7fbc65cd08f0b100","e7b7f5210a96bf16706cacb3ebb9adfab9e63b68","8acf8873f8378a979d079b108b5b9ec8cdb4c600","368dcb9fcc65066abb469260589711f7fcf3ea26","95453267b19102ecb2ebb101dfcb70691c4b533e","7653b8cab5a12308a8ce86673d9b4c32ab55fb3f","9c3c2edff488590829712bc9ce72aed5eab7e3ad","dac6ca1c6c38605c9e2b9aef9d11008d252bd3ef","6ef4cd46fa1020a02f39dfab5d0eb7fc20a24ed5","df0a4bf3905ec7c17981763178b392561336b273","6b018bdb6c425f0361b29781758e10f9677c15c6","3f62127e86a0d49ee94e96ea9c304004d4ba7d92","8e76efb0ce269d5e93da08fc203aa57bb050723d","b19f67c403e681ae5914d905f5d89589f92f43dc","2168084178854ee1657377c68da39f050b0fa569","c53cadcc0ff56b686f22b888f6031549ed6a9887","7275767531ffd4d0c79c771902989d8c052f58d1"],"title":"Nonparametric estimation and testing of fixed effects panel data models.","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2008.01.005"}

This is an important issue, as subgroup analyses are often required to demonstrate efficacy in the development of drugs with a companion diagnostic. Here, it is shown, for typical randomization methods, that the fraction of patients in the subgroup given experimental treatment matches, on average, the target fraction in the entire study. Also, mean covariate values are balanced, on average, between treatment arms in the subgroup, and it is argued that the variance in covariate imbalance between treatment arms in the subgroup is at worst only slightly increased versus a subgroup-stratified randomization method. Finally, in an analysis of variance setting, a least-squares treatment effect estimator within the subgroup is shown to be unbiased whether or not the randomization is stratified on subgroup membership. Thus, a requirement that a study be stratified on subgroup membership would place an artificial roadblock to innovation and the goals of personalized healthcare.","inCitations":["63931468584ffbc937f7e32d116e4add09b6fad0","9448c1744df784df807fa8a4c734618031389945","d3b88831853161536647ebf9c956b456c235e9a9","2822cd4f41962615b1ae6e1a8480a3c4afe1b33f","f538ca7e1eeda4d0f5409d00b66662b6951f3629","10d3ad6256dde0525600c347bc4b5ef91b9b1c37"],"title":"Stratification of randomization is not required for a pre-specified subgroup analysis.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1550"}

Dyads constitute a special case of hierarchically structured data with variation at both the individual and dyadic level. Analyses of data from dyads pose several challenges due to the interdependence between members within dyads and issues related to small group sizes. Multilevel analytic techniques have been developed and applied to dyadic data in an attempt to resolve these issues. In this article, we describe a set of analyses for modeling individual- and dyad-level influences on binary outcomes using SAS statistical software; and we discuss the benefits and limitations of such an approach. For illustrative purposes, we apply these techniques to estimate individual-dyad-level predictors of viral hepatitis C infection among heterosexual couples in East Harlem, New York City.","inCitations":["dc5bc034ef97c164d9bb7c5fcc7c016ecae4dff9","3f80e6de3db8811c3d4734512ad306f196c82974","9fff13549d225cb8c053f285db597c039820eeaa","0a4f68f2ffbe6ce8af132a3e40a7031f8d8624a1","9599d9ff13c5df503dfb2bda35086595c4e9ef45","0bdb6e295855f1bfd42d0c7f73ac6bf08c6081c3","3a1a31ac74e4ddb85bfd7cffa0a68a0313c21609","97667d038103119c0e261775d480c15ccd99e238","779d7cc6d2a22a39a538ea11ac3fbb923bb41a9b","d0644f9c7aaefd9697c24007a634908130ac3f15","570fc7c470f9f460d8a56dca64c1887740b0c639","1e476710a91abea04c5f12798e70ace594d64427","2dabd1a2b108a762cb694ed8d6b9d3e1786cd400","3cf9b0debc3a06c7d45ed4b929a0b5a852696d12","54b1f7201a3659353822532474384a992df7b63f","93dc7362b49985a098d2605e2f4cb5a7333debc3","8a934f52e72cec96bcaf742bad9c43c07b3fcb6b","d4033a74808e5019b510d10852248087e352ad34","fcd22df09e1fe6053eb29e5dc34e8e24947b2834","7eee82a9a1758f217479374d3a4e9ab6b146ed61","44569e164aac470dc63ead93ec4c8c915e9fd099","d80b071ef08cf4b5e2bc9ad9779966931a1df3a4","99d99f4585ac240c2d1bbf48a409e3b4cb8ff03d","92e5b682a64debbdc2764677a1a4719f0d802496","20a41634fc70ef9e67bdb1eef69658321f58f0b0","c21f46325c7444c9e391d063425f5ffd9658ccbb","b1e45cebb1c8320dd22db7ae3b8db0f0743f6e55","27f98d8acb97d29555d64d95d633116d4b2cb163","692758132f96a11371aa25915319534f808a04d9","66faee02ec23a2ca4a58cdca9ecdc2f6f4cdfeac","5e1a000a6d61ec2c87d850d706488bb6c79fde7a","96ab66dc704ad4b5ced8a326f361a1eca6cbd952","bbff98f0d688b121cc21a6a61cd4052bb82a9c4b","c60d9b2b8ddeee69a56c75ee71734e4a81f94966","85e7beef255e2709d99acb529f0175bf98f465bf","9af84701233c0b2a1a49086d97eb062d2f726aec","a524d6be441af4cf6ea9a70915206a7672fc6394","8a2d4f58471d31139a1d11f3ee6ee0697b67aa85","a9c3b870981b0aad5247ec10f18c86f65e6ab4b8","2201424d3d8900088441450fd0e2b64ac0b271cb","fd60605a5edf0dc28ccb3a3c06e24cfdfafaa20b","73f0f5df0741581774c0825459d63b07a0525f97","ba3e8a2399d0e22318f9336f6b1807f0e72fefa6","3d882601f0538ebcdad2449a6058f4a4d99bcb9c"],"title":"A guide for multilevel modeling of dyadic data with binary outcomes using SAS PROC NLMIXED","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2005.08.008"}

Missing data in clinical trials have been shown to reduce statistical power and potentially bias estimates of effect size; however, in NI and equivalence trials, they present additional issues. For instance, they may decrease sensitivity to differences between treatment groups and bias toward the alternative hypothesis of NI (or equivalence).\n\n\nAIMS\nOur primary aim was to review the extent of and methods for handling missing data (model-based methods, single imputation, multiple imputation, complete case), the analysis sets used (Intention-To-Treat, Per-Protocol, or both), and whether sensitivity analyses were used to explore departures from assumptions about the missing data.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a systematic review of NI and equivalence trials published between May 2015 and April 2016 by searching the PubMed database. Articles were reviewed primarily by 2 reviewers, with 6 articles reviewed by both reviewers to establish consensus.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 109 selected articles, 93% reported some missing data in the primary outcome. Among those, 50% reported complete case analysis, and 28% reported single imputation approaches for handling missing data. Only 32% reported conducting analyses of both intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. Only 11% conducted any sensitivity analyses to test assumptions with respect to missing data.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMissing data are common in NI and equivalence trials, and they are often handled by methods which may bias estimates and lead to incorrect conclusions.","inCitations":["62786a5536ed297e5292b52f8b203e1147284d86","3892291dccffe7577aaa0f89abeeb2eeb4dfa439","57202c7a18ae262cadcc69b86b5a4a130a11d544"],"title":"Missing data handling in non-inferiority and equivalence trials: A systematic review.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1867"}

One approach to analyzing such competing risks data involves modeling the cause-specific hazards as functions of baseline covariates.

We then consider application of multiple imputation to handle missing covariate values, and extend the recently proposed substantive model compatible version of fully conditional specification (SMC-FCS) imputation to the competing risks setting. Through simulations and an illustrative data analysis, we compare CCA, SMC-FCS, and a recent proposal for imputing missing covariates in the competing risks setting.","inCitations":["c49a29173cdeb4efcdef11c91627d450d4d76fd3","d58420309c19e4455395504b4d1b37a01ca75d90","a7400dbbab4dcb08853acf227ce802308f1816c2","f5e66c903ab73d1161f35663253df093dd2c7739","3245c4c3b97afd0f4fba8e15d8cdc0b337e60f57","74ce264811ca2028d51cb40543bf3f9344330771","6dbf309d5770f4aadb395da40769a36620777c59","94fb856d12b7fe34eb3142967ca04a3bcea87fa7"],"title":"Missing covariates in competing risks analysis","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw019"}
