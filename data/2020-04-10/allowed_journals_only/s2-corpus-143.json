With the rapid development of science and technology in the past decades, large amount of tensor observations are routinely collected, processed, and stored in many scientific researches and commercial activities nowadays. The colorimetric sensor array (CSA) data is such an example. Driven by the need to address data analysis challenges that arise in CSA data, we propose a tensor dimension reduction model, a model assuming the nonlinear dependence between a response and a projection of all the tensor predictors. The tensor dimension reduction models are estimated in a sequential iterative fashion. The proposed method is applied to a CSA data collected for 150 pathogenic bacteria coming from 10 bacterial species and 14 bacteria from one control species. Empirical performance demonstrates that our proposed method can greatly improve the sensitivity and specificity of the CSA technique.","inCitations":["5b9bd30d51b5e0b9f80018dba89bf027e44668fd","a9823d2ea922ff355d6e7b8aaa0885d28088a624","7014a633d6ba1e846ebdb58c16bce35e2f98155c"],"title":"Tensor sufficient dimension reduction.","doi":"10.1002/wics.1350"}

A proportional hazards model with shared frailties expresses the hazard for each subject. Often a one-parameter gamma distribution is assumed for the frailties. In this paper, we construct formal goodness-of-fit tests to test for gamma frailties. We construct a new class of frailty models that extend the gamma frailty model by using certain polynomial expansions that are orthogonal with respect to the gamma density. For this extended family, we obtain an explicit expression for the marginal likelihood of the data. The order selection test is based on finding the best fitting model in such a series of expanded models. A bootstrap is used to obtain p-values for the tests.

CIBB (Meeting)","paperAbstract":"Modern digital pathology departments have grown to produce whole-slide image data at petabyte scale, an unprecedented treasure chest for medical machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, most digital slides are not annotated at the image level, hindering large-scale application of supervised learning. Manual labeling is prohibitive, requiring pathologists with decades of training and outstanding clinical service responsibilities. This problem is further aggravated by the United States Food and Drug Administration's ruling that primary diagnosis must come from a glass slide rather than a digital image. We present the first end-to-end framework to overcome this problem, gathering annotations in a nonintrusive manner during a pathologist's routine clinical work: (i) microscope-specific 3D-printed commodity camera mounts are used to video record the glass-slide-based clinical diagnosis process; (ii) after routine scanning of the whole slide, the video frames are registered to the digital slide; (iii) motion and observation time are estimated to generate a spatial and temporal saliency map of the whole slide. Demonstrating the utility of these annotations, we train a convolutional neural network that detects diagnosis-relevant salient regions, then report accuracy of 85.15% in bladder and 91.40% in prostate, with 75.00% accuracy when training on prostate but predicting in bladder, despite different pathologists examining the different tissues. When training on one patient but testing on another, AUROC in bladder is 0.79±0.11 and in prostate is 0.96±0.04.

However, it should be noted that these popular Chi-square tests are asymptotic in nature and are useful when the cell frequencies are \"not too small.\" In this article, we explore the accuracy of the Chi-square tests through an extensive simulation study and then propose their bootstrap versions that appear to work better than the asymptotic Chi-square tests. The bootstrap tests are useful even for small-cell frequencies as they maintain the nominal level quite accurately. Also, the proposed bootstrap tests are more convenient than the Fisher's exact test which is often criticized for being too conservative. Finally, all test methods are applied to a few real-life datasets for demonstration purposes.","inCitations":["290e7c8e9467e443d5435d6fcb1ebd019ae74c25","7a3d0906a22b2032dfbbc3a79a8695c160add596","627d4cbe78b194886b71064985fe399d2fed3514","ee862fc1b263531e9eb2c2a7fecbdc47737e6ac3","438400b68614115b0c14407f580936cd9eaed7b3","c25a2505b191bf6a1877c10ec6eb3ae358e81cc3","cb936ec0b4c84d9c89a8302e2581196037d081b7","5ba72f7e4cee29f42a4ce24dee1b1158452ec523","49fcec18b321a5f7b3de782b20d91028b9fb5de8"],"title":"A revisit to contingency table and tests of independence: bootstrap is preferred to Chi-square approximations as well as Fisher's exact test.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.920851"}

The traditional methods for analysing randomized response data are restricted to univariate data and only allow inferences at the group level due to the randomized response sampling design. Here, a novel beta-binomial model is proposed for analysing multivariate individual count data observed via a randomized response sampling design. This new model allows for the estimation of individual response probabilities (response rates) for multivariate randomized response data utilizing an empirical Bayes approach. A common beta prior specifies that individuals in a group are tied together and the beta prior parameters are allowed to be cluster-dependent. A Bayes factor is proposed to test for group differences in response rates. An analysis of a cheating study, where 10 items measure cheating or academic dishonesty, is used to illustrate application of the proposed model.","inCitations":["e21791f15740cd6f49bb5524c2b30e82b64e0525","52656ff7d82502fc560a461fd3ca2d80b9f364ad","238139076ea99fa68c52f1eedc425201817b35c4"],"title":"Beta-binomial ANOVA for multivariate randomized response data.","doi":"10.1348/000711007X226040"}

Three problems needed to be addressed. Firstly, since the emergence time of a tooth and the time it experiences caries were recorded yearly, the time to caries is doubly interval censored. Secondly, due to the setup of the study, many emergence times were left-censored. Thirdly, events on teeth of the same child are dependent. Our Bayesian analysis is a modified version of the intensity model of Harkanen et al. (2000, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 27, 577-588). To tackle the problem of the large number of left-censored observations a similar Finnish data set was introduced. Our analysis shows no convincing effect of fluoride-intake on caries development.","inCitations":["4b67485630d70f4beedf1f2f8f1ccdf6aaa1b331","63c9c841177fc22734ad96d76afe5a574ffca7d4","871a197e57dbabed7ccd86e075dd2d074c9643bf","b9d32435cd8a948fe1f5e4f32a98c9d75477a2d5","374c0a093ae9826b0aac43e5cfae26f1ef587c74","e628bb186c41f6c976e44e1e04ab3246cf8fabd4","faf5bac3d308e5dd5caa165293ec2ca162e30da1","d5ff8587e467ff127647e20285d6a533698dd2db","95feaba2bd07747109a991d3b14da1fd6609e114","ff7e8e515b57f36a019742f99f08a48aee91b53e","55a4fb146f927def591ce96b05325b2b3c1aeaa0","7a3434303d33b9ad9382187093049e4545170c91","2e8df098ed54faa85434213a30c2ca39503af62b","4d258e109e4dd9651ed35045acd45384ccfeabf1","13e4671fb68fb847576def1f55c56c25950be4c5","52d0b982998937059201f680dc75d98d9d00cde7","f73be515bb36bfb8ae1ba47bcc79342923e0295c","4b9146a0c8560740d4770da5dabfd3871d8f64c5","dbb7cf7dbca42908a2d7c8a63a4610b8628752e0","17206405bfac28ed8c237a608081742e3a841b3d","b3b27b78a098a54ef8edcc08fb61537585a53100","be46a926c93bb9f1d0a2e9aa186a1ba66010c23d","5bba18ce10c4f8feaee2e8fc4e425590a4bb6342"],"title":"A Bayesian analysis of multivariate doubly-interval-censored dental data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxh023"}

For most of the samples, only the outcome Y and surrogate covariates, W , are available. These surrogates may be data from prior studies using older technologies. Owing to the dimension of the problem and the large fraction of missing information, a critical issue is appropriate shrinkage of model parameters for an optimal bias-variance tradeoff. We discuss a variety of fully Bayesian and Empirical Bayes algorithms which account for uncertainty in the missing data and adaptively shrink parameter estimates for superior prediction. These methods are evaluated via a comprehensive simulation study. In addition, we apply our methods to a lung cancer dataset, predicting survival time (Y) using qRT-PCR ( X ) and microarray ( W ) measurements.","inCitations":["92c5973bd6c5d482f298ef87ab2d7b0ae1087fae","f29f396049a3c78609a056c4e5a371de211979d0","bbbe1629a6a29c7fea8755b2f8bf148156e00a44","28c1b3d8d11e28ac9a4b7b952c86053bac6a00f0","31a941e165b5bfde743134ac7de5d02f502f8def"],"title":"Bayesian Shrinkage Methods for Partially Observed Data with Many Predictors.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS668"}

Using the Bayesian methodology, this prior information can be used quantitatively and the randomization can be weighted in favor of the new compound, where there is less information. An Emax model is used to describe the dose-response of the existing drug. The estimates from this model are used to provide informative prior information used for the design and analysis of the new study to establish the relative potency between the new compound and the existing drug therapy. The assumption is made that the data from previous trials and the new study are exchangeable. The impact of departures from this assumption can be quantified through simulations and by assessing the operating characteristics of various scenarios. Simulations show that relatively modest sample sizes can yield informative results about the magnitude of the relative potency using this approach. The operating characteristics are good when assessing model estimates against clinically important changes in relative potency.","inCitations":["cca22ff79e6cb8309f63de0e5bc501ae24068bb6","9360be319112b26dd951a51848b85edd5ecd567b","61ed92eca381c12a4ba1d4102992de4640822c27","508514a9687c4f213ed1424677e5c35f02b3d8b6","759493112ba4aa2491e4fec9ac2cebacc3ce9c43","deb93e4238e187e441f1f752e00e18f628c9b3be"],"title":"A Bayesian design and analysis for dose-response using informative prior information.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600860535"}

The construction of optimal designs for dose-ranging trials with multiple periods is considered in this paper, where the outcome of the trial (the effect of the drug) is considered to be a binary response: the success or failure of a drug to bring about a particular change in the subject after a given amount of time. The carryover effect of each dose from one period to the next is assumed to be proportional to the direct effect. It is shown for a logistic regression model that the efficiency of optimal parallel (single-period) or crossover (two-period) design is substantially greater than a balanced design. The optimal designs are also shown to be robust to misspecification of the value of the parameters. Finally, the parallel and crossover designs are combined to provide the experimenter with greater flexibility.","inCitations":["4aab6bf73706375090c9dcce074cf4d72bc04368","03cfef1609ee461482eeba70d5a9e6242f64c1f1","51a817e31f4b91246e88d1b5d3e6b8476b21b98e","9c4db16f8464b2615db3ab37594249e327658c5d","588e46ee04aa364f803b05eaaaeaa92bdde2c76a"],"title":"Optimal crossover designs for logistic regression models in pharmacodynamics.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600851880"}

For example, antihypertensive treatments can be compared on the basis of blood pressure measurements, or on the basis of the proportions of patients with blood pressure in prespecified ranges. This report is concerned with the loss of power when inherently continuous variables are dichotomized. The report will focus on the power loss when a normally distributed variable with a known, common variance in each of two groups is dichotomized. Power is shown to depend on the relationship between the means of the two groups and the cutoff point, and it varies from negligible to substantial. The results will be applied to data from the Lovastatin Restenosis Trial. Initially the trial considered a dichotomous outcome (proportion of patients with elevated percent diameter stenosis), but the endpoint was later changed to the mean percent diameter stenosis. The modification in the design of the trial was well justified because the power loss was considerable when comparing proportions.","inCitations":["e2be9791894303663d487018858a4207cd972688","3c090fe30feaab563c9d9a0980e925fdbe120376","700af66d53b204a0f38737c43e3eff7c88059a19","d91d3e11b7f51ef640c903c50d5a0c6bc2bb7319","c1442d5d070c195b9aac88399490c0a3c801d614","1522a3a6391112a0a3c1e0c1e7790bb2775f690b","5efd1e78df2a2d365b429aae13d316664940721d","3e6c8eff4b7f3bd6f88d5908158e848fa83551af","8e5cc430b2e8b174f0df82a2bb0e78f7eb079d94","da7f69ffbfcb09570f0aa3964eee71eb87956dec","10558d50e88ec4ad0530a41bdec267d7770cb8e6","dbddd8bcc31fd36b2585495d8ba86e9d6ae58e2a","ba9b16351136031a947c6824d42086e2d510674d","22e8d31df8062b13b56b6f0e2728680c330a64e1"],"title":"Power considerations when a continuous outcome variable is dichotomized.","doi":"10.1080/10543409808835243"}

This may be due to concerns about possible differences in treatment tolerability between populations. In this study, we propose to adaptively incorporate historical data into prior distributions assumed in a new dose-finding trial. Our proposed approach aims to appropriately borrow strength from a previous trial to improve the maximum tolerated dose determination in another patient population. We define a \"historical-to-current (H-C)\" parameter representing the degree of borrowing based on a retrospective analysis of previous trial data. In simulation studies, we examine the operating characteristics of the proposed method in comparison with 3 alternative approaches and assess how the H-C parameter functions across a variety of realistic settings.","inCitations":["8484be05b4d17eb466f6b1098e559f82127daabf","870ac68e808f82d5698ef39797d81cee19b5ca84","6f137b559176c6e5b2d351857de882e47c8be2c1"],"title":"Bayesian dose-finding phase I trial design incorporating historical data from a preceding trial.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1850"}

The main emphasis is on the Cox proportional hazards model but also additive hazard models are discussed. Attenuation of regression coefficients caused by infrequent updating of covariates is evaluated using simulated data mimicking our main example, the CSL1 liver cirrhosis trial. We conclude that the degree of attenuation depends on the type of stochastic process describing the time-dependent covariate and that attenuation may be substantial for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Also trends in the covariate combined with non-synchronous updating may cause attenuation. Simple methods to adjust for infrequent updating of covariates are proposed and compared to existing techniques using both simulations and the CSL1 data. The comparison shows that while existing, more complicated methods may work well with frequent updating of covariates the simpler techniques may have advantages in larger data sets with infrequent updatings.","inCitations":["135874a0985f1fd1addfe4c6b995bed9bcd245b2","f0666175e7bdb545bdd797161eaa997524fbb47f","b05ffc2274d34b80086f10a168ad708057218151","a0a2f7167a1ee08362e766f659d805b64c4613c3","6c0cbc44c073cc07c0c3e4148512f996a01fd88b","b2adb1c150729871ccdde73d00b818f6962650c1","6fe7409047b51c91188b50047c4958cd079e9b7b","dc05f6856281fc0f332599a577ab6858893eb146","3307ffc7425b09689381a53fc322c8c4599f7793","815dbc24f358cb3cae55d36067f77b09a815b487","74e89cb0580da74403a445c113163ee1aa9e0158","cbed115bed185166f1dc7a47e8314a60369c5641","f3ae6115fe0ccf656dc0bb46ba3d69d946a021d9","bd857a02f9bf497ef820c32e8ef31d2ff2c6fde9","801352e63835b5c079a96399564f0548b407324c","ddc0d8e8513949ecea3d2a28be44eb2accf8b57c","46a40a1ea269353f6da4fba4fef7fa076f26fe1e","b54ecc43bd511e0dd10ae40b60e3d8727f037392","2a13fcd273ea494308ae14798afb4b6016684dc9"],"title":"Attenuation caused by infrequently updated covariates in survival analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.4.633"}

To date many sequencing analyses of rare variants have focused on marginal genetic effects and have not explored the potential role environmental factors play in modifying genetic risk. Analysis of gene-environment interaction (GxE) for rare variants poses considerable challenges because of variant rarity and paucity of subjects who carry the variants while being exposed. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical model to jointly assess the GxE effects of a set of rare variants for example, in a gene or regulatory region, leveraging the information across the variants. Under this model, GxE is modeled by two components. The first component incorporates variant functional information as weights to calculate the weighted burden of variant alleles across variants, and then assess their GxE interaction with the environmental factor. Since this information is a priori known, this component is fixed effects in the model. The second component involves residual GxE effects that have not been accounted for by the fixed effects. In this component, the residual GxE effects are postulated to follow an unspecified distribution with mean 0 and variance [Formula: see text] We develop a novel testing procedure by deriving two independent score statistics for the fixed effects and the variance component separately. We propose two data-adaptive combination approaches for combining these two score statistics and establish the asymptotic distributions. An extensive simulation study shows that the proposed approaches maintain the correct type I error and the power is comparable to or better than existing methods under a wide range of scenarios. Finally we illustrate the proposed methods by a exome-wide GxE analysis with NSAIDs use in colorectal cancer.","inCitations":["b4f7f04d0f9e7fb3c0bd1822ec7ee0aa0c6d7b61","22128f3413d2990862edead014b4d2f313090bb1","4e9bbbf590b23eb9a996edda64d8be7f0e9931f0","a5f582ec88b393d101a44edd5544686c7ccdf856","e5baa14894f882f6a2ec0a50d20965d6733e8c37","de0e17fa5bda6283dfc523272cc51fe420452dbf"],"title":"A unified powerful set-based test for sequencing data analysis of GxE interactions.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw034"}

Our sparse PCA is formulated as solving an optimization problem with a criterion function motivated from penalized Bernoulli likelihood. A Majorization-Minimization algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the optimization problem.
