The weight matrices are obtained initially fitting a discretized multivariate normal distribution, which admits a wide range of dependence. The general methodology is applied to negative binomial regression models. Asymptotic and small-sample efficiency calculations show that our method is robust and nearly as efficient as maximum likelihood for fully specified copula models. An illustrative example is given to show the use of our weighted scores method to analyze utilization of health care based on family characteristics.","inCitations":["2fb016da7cb6c97735008cd2d87a20425ed1f2b5","62156cbd90f1146b249319ebb4f5ca454841fba4","76fd778caee5a8f6cd9deb48fc17c85222fbf552","d3a21644a3584dde8a81ecc2c0bb9a38972ddb5c","73c91dc29b17a0ca8207509c9cbf052f6ae1926b","f09557729a65cd87b8bbfd0950125063e06b97da","cc8a33ad748253c39fe9cc94a07729a0c3f4ba85","c247e2140e771beaf40a378fbe52edbb9e044da5","c11e29d739f1f6d0614cf78a6d128cee83941f35","cd06cc0d55adac6f89b4917d7705a735a65fd800","de68ab113639c9d6bbd39983baddae18e36c5721"],"title":"Weighted scores method for regression models with dependent data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr005"}

The derivation uses the fact that an upper tolerance limit for a random variable can be derived from a lower confidence limit for the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the random variable. The concept of a generalized confidence interval is used to derive the required lower confidence limit for the cdf. In the bivariate normal case, a suitable representation of the cdf of the ratio of the marginal normal random variables is also used, coupled with the generalized confidence interval idea. In addition, a simplified derivation is presented in the situation when one of the random variables has a small coefficient of variation. The problem is motivated by an application from a reverse transcriptase assay. Such an example is used to illustrate our results. Numerical results are also reported regarding the performance of the proposed tolerance limit.","inCitations":["8ef695b20d53931649d52a129214967b5a863af6","11918081fa41a468031b7b4d93e9f09cef3e43a6"],"title":"Tolerance limits for a ratio of normal random variables.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903280647"}

In applications, it is possible that certain predictors only affect the response in particular regions and not everywhere. This corresponds to identifying the domain where the varying coefficient is nonzero. Towards this goal, local polynomial smoothing and penalized regression are incorporated into one framework. Asymptotic properties of our penalized estimators are provided. Specifically, the estimators enjoy the oracle properties in the sense that they have the same bias and asymptotic variance as the local polynomial estimators as if the sparsity is known as a priori. The choice of appropriate bandwidth and computational algorithms are discussed.

A common purpose of microarray experiments is the detection of genes that are differentially expressed under two conditions, such as treatment versus control or wild type versus knockout. We introduce a Laplace mixture model as a long-tailed alternative to the normal distribution when identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments, and provide an extension to asymmetric over- or underexpression. This model permits greater flexibility than models in current use as it has the potential, at least with sufficient data, to accommodate both whole genome and restricted coverage arrays. We also propose likelihood approaches to hyperparameter estimation which are equally applicable in the Normal mixture case. The Laplace model appears to give some improvement in fit to data, though simulation studies show that our method performs similarly to several other statistical approaches to the problem of identification of differential expression.","inCitations":["7f9cc00fbdadac07a2023baadd4ea08239c24ef6","91e488385853ca61894f342e35d4b4b65ed93bd0","2ecd116d574854444055fdb16217420db222b869","c4d128a6e0a3cb112e798effe10c56a098099076","1f5b8f72528b20a2a12ffd20f32367691f7af708","7271470e2badda1ea1801387affcfe7319c7dca1","ecfd817710fb851f2a4130d6cf26b01673c27fc9","b93d84a97f09664ec72d65682ef460cbac59fa09","49ad0c7d943bb65bc42bd9e9b10924619f17334e","acd42a4d7192e793a6883ec511578b66355d9b79","9c7a1076d6f47b581283b044f13a2a28d527ce40","e06dcbe47718daaaeb3037fd061dd3c64ffac577","ad643b118cdbe979c31d38efa4fe1a3a660fcf3f","25c16a40138b7828d438cde53534896c6e683075","29bffa01f1ad9057b31677db4ee35429db075821","a626649aa697a575651c234aaf6f29b0c1ff29ee","d9fe196c33fc18000b1f8b956b440a8f3ac1912f","a830e326b1d9dd5b10c5c3063ab0435877b13a0d","e695553d1d4718d06a630eb7feed627850fb4418","78d7c7bf918ade8b4ecc4455e437d16144cb07ed","9ecdd8d8d6183c1628283f120bb6ce42fc3f0ea1","5a59c75a1e4da12d2dd777526d9f54037d3b4313","fca83d66bcb0ee697fb3f1dfadc7d16eaab58c3e","52cd1d0277e7e23945b70a810f5839633fd2a1a7","ba305d28ab5570a7022982b3e80b7985d8279753","679a3eecdffba9546305eaee16af262bc2dffc6f","3cf45166ef4815e5ba8145d3d9a0054bb4dc7e94","7b275b5f158dbd06d2ace33ad7a39097dbf9a09c"],"title":"A Laplace mixture model for identification of differential expression in microarray experiments.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj032"}

When investigating this phenomenon experimentally with several types or levels of stimulus, it is useful to have treatment sequences which are balanced for first-order carry-over effects. The requirement of balance for each experimental participant leads us to consider sequences of n symbols comprising an initial symbol followed by n ;blocks' each containing a permutation of the symbols. These sequences are designed to include all n (2) ordered pairs of symbols once each, and to have treatment and sequence position effects which are approximately or thogonal. Such sequences were suggested by Finney and Outhwaite (1956), who were able to find examples for particular values of n. We describe and illustrate acomputer algorithm for systematically enumerating the sequences for those values of n for which they exist. Criteria are proposed for choosing between the sequences according to the nearness to orthogonality of their treatment and position effects.","inCitations":["a082cc30d201cba34a01ba85e9b7e1ec0b345d18","d2b19d87bb0741887f31af1c62843e382447779e","36cd21b4fb8889ab7c9720a5d7dd9c125f39b3f8","00b00247bfcf39b883415c3a487b6875d9289f81","5e34339b13d8e0cc4f651fa140ce6c4121b92309","074bfa7aa82054b7bfedd5c6fc3f9e52d2c5a701","b295ef894029c0478fdd21ace66026d420ef465e","9454c12d38939c9b2c560228271c63e2c4a6f34d","107a5ff2c11bafdfa3ec4e100d1ac4e5da86d7c5","eb44c9d6b7d50e5a8c07dfa563d93d48fec8ef42","8a6b2c4b2a84763a65d4fe5a937c59ab8c209fa6","8cad35fa64120ff9e6bb178a353b2fad5674795d","c7d3581c44fb7d2f407a7e084a6b2f768d9145c8","eb5029960be02abd90c042b5e5a43ff4ec647726","0af5c75aaaceee0deeeb13269416fb43f0dab2ec","80d4f1069b17ba6c396f250169882710a65bfda0","f5e2bd37b9ad7b848650834327c777e7c66228da","f3a9e667ac71947a200418c659d36fbee7171b6c","a3f2425f7a154143d12eff89a17a60d9502a11d5","532fe923eab449d9c39571276b003e80856e0f77","173785211402a4cd28416373e8ffcd9aa8c86851","d5078503025d905206bf13998f2371d121f0b16c","7e4c3a01cb3031f4d82bd70cb2cc588321058f7b","a7cbd2a70ad70a929834756c48ab9076589ec1ea"],"title":"Design sequences for sensory studies: achieving balance for carry-over and position effects.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X114568"}

The method consists of two major steps. In step 1, the lasso method is applied to many bootstrap samples, each using a set of randomly selected covariates. A measure of importance is yielded from this step for each covariate. In step 2, a similar procedure to the first step is implemented with the exception that for each bootstrap sample, a subset of covariates is randomly selected with unequal selection probabilities determined by the covariates' importance. Adaptive lasso may be used in the second step with weights determined by the importance measures. The final set of covariates and their coefficients are determined by averaging bootstrap results obtained from step 2. The proposed method alleviates some of the limitations of lasso, elastic-net and related methods noted especially in the context of microarray data analysis: it tends to remove highly correlated variables altogether or select them all, and maintains maximal flexibility in estimating their coefficients, particularly with different signs; the number of selected variables is no longer limited by the sample size; and the resulting prediction accuracy is competitive or superior compared to the alternatives. We illustrate the proposed method by extensive simulation studies. The proposed method is also applied to a Glioblastoma microarray data analysis.","inCitations":["79de4c36042bd0c604f4029531ccbe771321bc0a","b2c3abe3ba6f55ec1c8b4fd26a126697277bea97","9cbec8a2c5ac76355eb195e440f741196ee4f22e","a1102c5f8710e7fb85be10b827ce87c6eefe98f0","8ad0766a86582cdcadf32257353b5f2d848cfd96","5e2f92363a82ca7a52d59c915e274344b2377fe8","73de4d7929dedd957a462d821de2f770966cbb8c","4c7adb863ec961c1325a011b88cf675b36ca7c97","4d9f9adbdb1c9156ed51e64fcc1eb979644fb940","bf4a53571b271c992dc1066abbaa54b1fccea952","24cb8343ea7d69c27bac69f4f2143b5c5770dcfc","f1daad2f5f2caa8f852848f6bbb888ca1e34fa01","9d43b60bf6543daa9e578dab210db4e1bfb35fa3","f28fda85187c2279fc439e2c99a0e77820f0aec4","94e1c60969c13242d04ab0cc4b9ba931ea04a025","802d3491f0a70cb1a3e14973ecf08b5610fab36b","c0af985eb8b920deb434f56b96eee02b62719df7","c21b5c635ff6112fa56cf7bfa0195e329d798548","4c7dfb5c9994b2e1b9e99c3d2402ee864a7ccd82","5a1cfd6266461d891680c6b5272506cd74b532ce","d3175cf12c994f38daca008b75c0153bc423d74d","cfd5937c17e6ce4d0cb707117c5f1a4714c20d60","c37509d1a9c48c07fff1c11982ecd003bfbc30bb","696a0c7b481f012fa7e3780f508dbc8624be563c","b23a164475f717411e4752db3409ed37cfb4b728","91a486a69faf9403a5db68561178ddd1ca504daf","e418b70e4d25a1872ed07fda5dfb82e1dd1c75cc","8e46edbfbe0451251b7752e2d648156f0bdf686c","1a6de65cff29841da4d7a73ec6bb236ed9ae5a46","49d4cdfacea09109e368291778d6e9ca2e6c34ab","d991aaf8ea097fa42d7d2c94ae48c80e93f2a70c","88e23a0301af9a82ab4afa690ec269828e0e6759","770edaae55b7735790786117fdf3dce6d53d7078","d69434c45879465295b446aa9830c5de01818ff6","316024824de0b60377d39e2cde34054f9e7623ec","9cf3d2dd18f2af99335234d6942da98503a83b2c","0f20a0543fc28c1d26ba8ff5bbd46cbdda00207b","9c6b09469dccdc2c8ec3bc64c1e35a2f444fc0a0","92d9586fe3a187b624f0d54f1dbd47307074c7ee","5b3038f2de48579a1d99fb829e7c43562f4f4ed0","086dcd14bb96beb40a7da3a4ba9a626c3f222954","152d020216d6d003746034b3a3bcebe042399f6b","a1cd803d0db0ee1e312192bb92b6bd1c60936b7f","5189320ea4a62626cf4ecfaac5041e89c0ff42d6","b2f69c5889f18e73a87b1db633120bb89f98a508","bf725eb706b65a7e4f1a37ab855244906b38731d","ffda9421eb97d94558a1704bb88894a4c888d1fc","2bdb31efed951afcc80c7a93db51bc0d3a55c5e4","e9f7cee3bbc4deb0dc33cfede12570f3fb2c9b7f","987a73c74f3fa8c466f7d626cdeaaa912339a6b1","92c81150c8bc5f81a8016ef36be3bb826678eb3a","c47e64647e215625c6af666e381787e88d295edc","b74130e4fd7875d8621e85d6719768c2d9c2cf4a","931eeb2e10de67dfe0d364a066d03f5059b18cd9","eb22d0da7fdd9979a421d206aca82e5787a87048","84c42572bc867567901fb834dfe915dfbd1f14d2","ab0ef9e2a4cea0ce865dbc4ef44824adc9b1af78","2924e5ea9b9af15d838fe53483accef03a6e6354","02ca506b796ea634902535934e0a4765511f691b","3608d5f13c7426e1b22260f9042c85ec463bad62","a839daf4d95d8078dd8535f68adef446164e6c38"],"title":"Random Lasso.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS377"}

It is conceivable that utilization of priorly available pathway knowledge would greatly facilitate both interpretation and estimation in statistical analysis of such high-dimensional biological data. In this article, we propose a 2-step procedure for the purpose of identifying pathways that are related to and influence the clinical phenotype. In the first step, a nonlinear dimension reduction method is proposed, which permits flexible within-pathway gene interactions as well as nonlinear pathway effects on the response. In the second step, a regularized model-based pathway ranking and selection procedure is developed that is built upon the summary features extracted from the first step. Simulations suggest that the new method performs favorably compared to the existing solutions. An analysis of a glioblastoma microarray data finds 4 pathways that have evidence of support from the biological literature.","inCitations":["79b26af48c3eec9430e52958ea9deff067a45232","343b5c7d97cebf0ff912d4fc9af189ebbe511c85","300fb3c37ecebcbb3b11d7264b5c3be70c184b45","993887bca8894112db5fbdd4944dbe7450b46427","3248b2f360657c1b4e9fbc2eaa71939d33efe34f","1a6de65cff29841da4d7a73ec6bb236ed9ae5a46","6cc4056f41828165f9db11d1b5404c358887cd7a","d3f9efdbbadcc3e47e131ef9abf62616e22b6369","358747f1309c10da25e3a5ebb47eaf9b0714e096","324113e87eb4ff61610180f00b1b72801f676859"],"title":"Biological pathway selection through nonlinear dimension reduction.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq081"}

In addition, we present tables of decision rules under a variety of assumed realities for use in trial planning.

Underlying the concept of using such endpoints interchangeably to establish an efficacy claim, or pooling different endpoints to constitute a composite endpoint, is the assumption that findings from such endpoints are consistent with each other. While such an assumption about consistency of efficacy findings appears to be intuitive, it is seldom considered in the design and analysis literature of clinical trials with multiple endpoints. Failure to account for consistency of efficacy findings of two candidate endpoints to establish efficacy, at the design stage, has led to difficulties in interpreting study findings. This article presents a flexible testing strategy for accommodating findings of an alternative to the designated primary endpoint (or a subgroup) to support an efficacy claim. The method is built on the following two premises: (i) Efficacy findings of the designated primary endpoint, although nonsignificant, need to be supportive of those of the alternative endpoint, and (ii) the significance level allocated for testing the second endpoint is determined adaptively based on the magnitude of the p-value for the designated primary endpoint. The method takes into account the hierarchical ordering of the hypotheses tested and the correlation between the test statistics for the two endpoints to increase the chance of a positive trial.

Advances in exposure assessment and statistics allow for estimation of both critical windows of vulnerability and exposure effect heterogeneity. Simultaneous estimation of windows of vulnerability and effect heterogeneity can be accomplished by fitting a distributed lag model (DLM) stratified by subgroup. However, this can provide an incomplete picture of how effects vary across subgroups because it does not allow for subgroups to have the same window but different within-window effects or to have different windows but the same within-window effect. Because the timing of some developmental processes are common across subpopulations of infants while for others the timing differs across subgroups, both scenarios are important to consider when evaluating health risks of prenatal exposures. We propose a new approach that partitions the DLM into a constrained functional predictor that estimates windows of vulnerability and a scalar effect representing the within-window effect directly. The proposed method allows for heterogeneity in only the window, only the within-window effect, or both. In a simulation study we show that a model assuming a shared component across groups results in lower bias and mean squared error for the estimated windows and effects when that component is in fact constant across groups. We apply the proposed method to estimate windows of vulnerability in the association between prenatal exposures to fine particulate matter and each of birth weight and asthma incidence, and estimate how these associations vary by sex and maternal obesity status in a Boston-area prospective pre-birth cohort study.","inCitations":["3ea4ab0d049c66c7abf860abab804ffd9494e6b2","e5d06791cf9857f44eece2bd58ae1cfffcb5b3d0","92035bbd2baa542fc4fe569d448f145cf52bd830","3b76bffb915e5070f20772ee507820526903907d","278f334b0445f7e5717a98b8736ba3e11dda7c83","854e38cecb1c791e0efe4b3598ee605160b18eee","c40a267244814a17c88f1364c04001c243e9c520","071a4f93348d02d770d841b849f4ecca81726f29","783352c045428edb1d4cabd28039db2ec723fa4f","85ca4e06e5a7d8316b3519432456b1fef360c505","ec4d8e609cb4b7d8496e5da0fc85408d324d640c"],"title":"Bayesian distributed lag interaction models to identify perinatal windows of vulnerability in children's health.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx002"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2006,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Adaptation of clinical trial design generates many issues that have not been resolved for practical applications, though statistical methodology has advanced greatly. This paper focuses on some methodological issues. In one type of adaptation such as sample size re-estimation, only the postulated value of a parameter for planning the trial size may be altered. In another type, the originally intended hypothesis for testing may be modified using the internal data accumulated at an interim time of the trial, such as changing the primary endpoint and dropping a treatment arm. For sample size re-estimation, we make a contrast between an adaptive test weighting the two-stage test statistics with the statistical information given by the original design and the original sample mean test with a properly corrected critical value. We point out the difficulty in planning a confirmatory trial based on the crude information generated by exploratory trials. In regards to selecting a primary endpoint, we argue that the selection process that allows switching from one endpoint to the other with the internal data of the trial is not very likely to gain a power advantage over the simple process of selecting one from the two endpoints by testing them with an equal split of alpha (Bonferroni adjustment). For dropping a treatment arm, distributing the remaining sample size of the discontinued arm to other treatment arms can substantially improve the statistical power of identifying a superior treatment arm in the design. A common difficult methodological issue is that of how to select an adaptation rule in the trial planning stage. Pre-specification of the adaptation rule is important for the practicality consideration. Changing the originally intended hypothesis for testing with the internal data generates great concerns to clinical trial researchers.","inCitations":["983f805eec719839f072290e46c1eda5750db478","fd58d58e6e9607e364aaac8e05de6273839cb2fd","da4be9f0aa88a3ee54a89200d4e4e1c112673ff1","38e598295396b2c88790708af001447bebab1538","2008db5f52ac7beeefed2547ba35e311a2213638","575eeba99063323410629cc68d5af391db0b955c","f9e56361c5805d5f4d349f0f0557f11e061a33c5","853137a550ecd66cac271af6d7efb9e2a29e42e1","3ae7a4d040e4ed6e2dd84c20236d72f941ceb25a","d39ab6e7484e5623eecf8a55ab1c6d0e93bda5a8","76a4d99633059db2d7feb64c3735a23d02652e7d","67dd7d5371d87f44fe6d34dbd3f4ebd2f7567cb6","09e6da73bd6f25471e20629a85df8f3737498c30","29a8fa687561c01c5f2e79b20473ee8b69b4bc8f"],"title":"Methodological issues with adaptation of clinical trial design.","doi":"10.1002/pst.219"}

Methods available for the analysis of longitudinal quality-of-life data include linear mixed models (including growth curve models), generalized linear models, generalized estimating equations, and joint modeling of quality of life and the missingness process. Quality-adjusted survival (Q-TWiST) has also been useful to compare treatments. By weighting the durations of health states according to their quality of life, one arrives at a single end point reflecting the duration of survival and the quality of life. We propose methods for incorporating longitudinal quality-of-life data into quality-adjusted survival. We divide follow-up time into two states, \"poor\" and \"good,\" based on a cut-off applied to observed quality-of-life scores. Disease progression is handled as a separate state. We then use survival analysis methods to estimate the mean duration of each state as well as mean quality-adjusted time. The analysis is repeated by varying the cut-off to illustrate the range of possible results. Finally a single summary analysis is achieved by averaging (possibly with weights) across the cut-offs used. We illustrate the methodology using data from a cancer clincial trial.","inCitations":["a5b2793855c2544e1263f3b05b3d55d5e34f47d7","c112ed48efe0fb996785d45aa105726a3b8d7d50","73d98ef659dc49f393c7c6b804f5734d1b300d25","81de44624489aae9fe94610b9e9cc3120f72ebef","11436f586a550c262226ff2c71670d3f39b7c24d","d63e08888641ee8f71a4cd09286b940340bca597","bd84a1288cc471c767a320dd2e1b642b5b3453e6","1ecb825225e93e90bc8474afbc2db7a1c29cf4aa","ffd713a04cee09987820870fd78f2f4c957e8ea9","f4c93ed7c1f0ed980260708608e6175ea2cd6686","683fd10cbb0493c02d935b2c49a85f7d3cee91ff","e38e62dc0c5f6636e7ae70840970cd433a3956bb","441a8b6cf956a2f50047299fb0863b23d1fd0d36","1a4eb63ca0a6675003b375ca66652c192ba10ed8","1e5bef5a22f98853f0d3a94884c2341d9e7a9726"],"title":"A quality-adjusted survival (Q-TWiST) model for evaluating treatments for advanced stage cancer.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120028509"}

Sampling windows has been proposed for population pharmacokinetic experiments that are conducted in late phase drug development programs where patients are enrolled in many centers and out-patient clinic settings. Collection of samples under this uncontrolled environment at fixed times may be problematic and can result in uninformative data. A sampling windows approach is more practicable, as it provides the opportunity to control when samples are collected by allowing some flexibility and yet provide satisfactory parameter estimation. This approach uses D-optimality to specify time intervals around fixed D-optimal time points that results in a specified level of efficiency. The sampling windows have different lengths and achieve two objectives: the joint sampling windows design attains a high specified efficiency level and also reflects the sensitivities of the plasma concentration-time profile to parameters. It is shown that optimal sampling windows obtained using this approach are very efficient for estimating population PK parameters and provide greater flexibility in terms of when samples are collected.","inCitations":["588e46ee04aa364f803b05eaaaeaa92bdde2c76a","0bed14a5eb8ed3397042ffe289c63e0da376a9d1","ba1df5b95584818b03ffefa1a62308e945230a9c","13da9cfd0b56538fe886c4e2f67326b8f85a64c9","b969ce8edb9a75b5d92353fc24be9da230f03af2"],"title":"An effective approach for obtaining optimal sampling windows for population pharmacokinetic experiments.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802536131"}
