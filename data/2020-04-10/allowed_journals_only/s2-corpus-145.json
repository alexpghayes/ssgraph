While employing previously implemented sample size/power tools is appealing, they typically ignore important aspects of the design/data structure. In this paper, we show that sample size/power calculations that ignore confounding can be much more unreliable than is conventionally thought; using real data from the US state of North Carolina, naive calculations yield sample size estimates that are half those obtained when confounding is appropriately acknowledged. Unfortunately, eliciting realistic design parameters for confounding mechanisms is difficult. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage strategy for observational study design that can accommodate arbitrary patterns of confounding. At the first stage, researchers establish bounds for power that facilitate the decision of whether or not to initiate the study. At the second stage, internal pilot data are used to estimate key scientific inputs that can be used to obtain realistic sample size/power. Our results indicate that the strategy is effective at replicating gold standard calculations based on knowing the true confounding mechanism. Finally, we show that consideration of the nature of confounding is a crucial aspect of the elicitation process; depending on whether the confounder is positively or negatively associated with the exposure of interest and outcome, naive power calculations can either under or overestimate the required sample size. Throughout, simulation is advocated as the only general means to obtain realistic estimates of statistical power; we describe, and provide in an R package, a simple algorithm for estimating power for a case-control study.","inCitations":["e2803dc6a51bf3593742c785da18f40363a5f0d7","096dc542e6ea77ca2b7527136fc7b5bbadf24610","ed03b791473a2f4ac5d3eca629930e3b8026b610"],"title":"A two-stage strategy to accommodate general patterns of confounding in the design of observational studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr044"}

Equivalence is defined in terms of delta, the maximum difference in population means; a one-sided hypothesis test of delta is considered. We provide the distribution of the maximum pairwise difference in sample means, and we use this distribution to find critical values for tests of size 0.100, 0.050, 0.025, and 0.010. When standard errors are not equal among the three treatments, a simple adjustment is proposed to control the type I error rate. These tests are applied to studying the equivalence of three binomial proportions. Test-based confidence intervals are discussed.

The extent to which a positive result for such a Phase II trial is predictive for Phase III success is of obvious concern. In this article we extend existing approaches for assessing the probability of success in Phase III. We address the case that a dichotomous clinical endpoint of interest is to be measured in Phase III. A Beta prior distribution is suggested that quantifies information from both the data observed on the biomarker and its predictive accuracy. Based on the quantification of the impact of the predictive ability of biomarkers, it is shown that the predictive quality of a biomarker needs to be substantial to support the full development decision. The approach is illustrated with a practical example. A simulation study is presented to illustrate the findings more generally.","inCitations":["0cc01e17f76e41e38af0fcc9e22102d449854618"],"title":"An analytical approach to assess the predictive value of biomarkers in Phase II decision making.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.814377"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2013,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of applied statistics","paperAbstract":"L-moments, defined as specific linear combinations of expectations of order statistics, have been advocated by Hosking [7] and others in the literature as meaningful replacements to that of classic moments in a wide variety of applications. One particular use of L-moments is to classify distributions based on the so-called L-skewness and L-kurtosis measures and given by an L-moment ratio diagram. This method parallels the classic moment-based plot of skewness and kurtosis corresponding to the Pearson system of distributions. In general, these methods have been more descriptive in nature and failed to consider the corresponding variation and covariance of the point estimators. In this note, we propose two procedures to estimate the 100(1 - Î±)% joint confidence region of L-skewness and L-kurtosis, given both complete and censored data. The procedures are derived based on asymptotic normality of L-moment estimators or through a novel empirical characteristic function (c.f.) approach. Simulation results are provided for comparing the performance of these procedures in terms of their respective coverage probabilities. The new and novel c.f.-based confidence region provided superior coverage probability as compared to the standard bootstrap procedure across all parameter settings. The proposed methods are illustrated via an application to a complete Buffalo snow fall data set and to a censored breast cancer data set, respectively.","inCitations":["79c87ba679710a7e6f0a19881c4df2a4f4b8a90a","4dca8f4a59bf0e3df93cb06c4e1cedab5a462b5f","53004139623e0c9d607bfc25a9f6bef52d7386b9","fbac5ad94a43cbb1f7a5328530e1ea8091045a8f","8a91c939c1a421d4d726b89fe85e7c47526c34a8"],"title":"Joint confidence region estimation of L-moment ratios with an extension to right censored data.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2012.744386"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"This paper is an overview that summarizes recently developed tools in assessing agreement for methods comparison and instrument/assay validation in medical devices. This paper emphasizes concept, sample sizes, and examples more than analytical formulas. We have considered a unified approach of evaluating agreement among multiple instruments (k), each with multiple replicates (m) for both continuous and categorical data. We start with the basic scenario of two instruments (k = 2), each with only one measurement (m = 1). In this basic scenario for continuous data, we also consider if the target values are considered random (values of a gold standard instrument) or fixed (known values). In the more general case, we will not consider when the target values are fixed. We discuss the simplified sample size calculations. When there is a disagreement between methods, one needs to know if the source of the disagreement was due to a systematic shift (bias) or random error. The coefficients of accuracy and precision will be discussed to characterize these sources. This is important because a systematic shift usually can be easily fixed through calibration, while a random error usually is a more cumbersome variation reduction exercise. For categorical variables, we consider scaled agreement statistics. For continuous variables, we use scaled or unscaled agreement statistics. For variables with proportional error, we can simply apply a log transformation to the data. Finally, three examples are given: one for assay validation, one for a lab proficiency assessment, and one for a lab comparison on categorical assay.","inCitations":["02cd3fb150f6a991efbe6d61b7484bb6c5658ca0","cea7d94a88288ae2d308987e4c3f900a45843a6f","b3263599f66f51417b3ae73dcaf9a6a9686a1173","504071eb265b2ef8a702f4fa136c04d943d1072b","fbac7951328eda0548ddad96dc48a89746f344c1","a0dd2c37f9e5a6ca85378a70fabad1ba9fd8653c","6747ffa28e9e2c887e73820a1c8edfc1f43cff22","3fbb375eac64d2a23e93b20794346bb5127d6745","b9e3d0ecd9026c4d8ddd24157831dafa5c099524","b5482bba516ee086d77291a465a16630182725e7","4e08b7ba2c1e15ba1eab401f4c951a14d20bf6ec","f0658c722256e1aff15dfadb43ea8c687db226df","f2fcb2842eefc9911989c1a0cec32e941007a82e","38f48180e8dcff7f4362be0334b14d3d2e27ebf1","3a9e60459d4c4f6942d6ddc274e6ff8075392bc4","70b7088308f6fca32915a87f42534d2ddc111de6","e5c5d17c25d9888ae39e49d606a079962416112d","9ce6b7bbe43d92759b1af297b445e6f55353df69"],"title":"Overview of agreement statistics for medical devices.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701668290"}

Instrumental variables (IV) are a popular technique for addressing such confounding, enabling consistent estimation of causal effects. This paper proposes nonparametric IV estimators for censored time to event data that may be subject to competing risks. A simple, plug-in estimator is introduced using nonparametric estimators of the cumulative incidence function, with confidence intervals derived using asymptotic theory. To provide an overall test of the treatment effect, an integrated weighted difference statistic is suggested, which is applicable to data with and without competing risks.

A common thread to most genetic investigations is familial relationships. Close relatives can be identified from family records, and more distant relatives can be inferred from large panels of genetic markers. Unfortunately these empirical estimates can be noisy, especially regarding distant relatives. We propose a new method for denoising genetically-inferred relationship matrices by exploiting the underlying structure due to hierarchical groupings of correlated individuals. The approach, which we call Treelet Covariance Smoothing, employs a multiscale decomposition of covariance matrices to improve estimates of pairwise relationships. On both simulated and real data, we show that smoothing leads to better estimates of the relatedness amongst distantly related individuals. We illustrate our method with a large genome-wide association study and estimate the \"heritability\" of body mass index quite accurately. Traditionally heritability, defined as the fraction of the total trait variance attributable to additive genetic effects, is estimated from samples of closely related individuals using random effects models. We show that by using smoothed relationship matrices we can estimate heritability using population-based samples. Finally, while our methods have been developed for refining genetic relationship matrices and improving estimates of heritability, they have much broader potential application in statistics. Most notably, for error-in-variables random effects models and settings that require regularization of matrices with block or hierarchical structure.","inCitations":["d8ca82d7d80b1652e541ea64dca6e00c4cb9f86b","ed99d8ed8d1f83ac18443f3b73fbc0b9038250be","0ff73142f2fe9f72a7745d1b011ef2b2126137fb","7baa1cff26d6c6a625148bb7783787a3d05dfd85","f21bbed1915a8a16b31635421a91fa29834e25c1","e3d3fd059fb58e0dddeb22ebeb142c1052518a0d","830889e1a5a590599540540b4f3cf98dff0eca5f","23d65c602b78c1e06238417de9ac82ab6a536710"],"title":"Refining Genetically Inferred Relationships Using Treelet Covariance Smoothing.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS598"}

However, this assumption fails if the test statistics have discrete distributions or if the distributional model for the observables is misspecified. A stochastic process framework is introduced that, with the aid of a uniform variate, admits P-value statistics to satisfy the uniformity condition even when test statistics have discrete distributions. This allows nonparametric tests to be used to generate P-value statistics satisfying the uniformity condition. The resulting multiple testing procedures are therefore endowed with robustness properties. Simulation studies suggest that nonparametric randomised test P-values allow for these FDR methods to perform better when the model for the observables is nonparametric or misspecified.","inCitations":["858ebcba255653003d19f6a1b2a6935e9ec78c3d","bd3af34c575d7859b48e728b5456110b390a95a0","96b780ea9ac1cb44e66931e0ce65872e091ec232","684471ea1f4e6286f5ef5f103ef85a711cf83786","f813c00e72b0f4ef8fb9650c738bf9856362c118","6512eff14c6c574b6bc50b83344b7703d3db65fd","5f979b16d652f594af251c830cb0436aa5814a22","d6a8c6374723b1c87d9fc736012c180231b2fad0","121caf429ae2616431ad6412575243fef2f025e4","3920f0452f3afb3c8a3b6da8ff7e2508eadd14f1","4f3ca1e1743a28a598562481c7187e58c39673f9","80df4f31205d86297beaf0aca7b419508996b64d","3120e78cfb72cad6bc6335c6483c6014b6e920eb","5c5043e64508f025dc848974dd784330aa8eaae5","4dd4b33f71c574a1468b996f61a996190aa1f068","a580e2550a5e47f035331e8ee9e7fbc0cada9e38","95686586f26d5a1d152db72f6283c7a73335a513","d05f36bdce95eda3df2be3c770bceeeae85770d5"],"title":"Randomised P-values and nonparametric procedures in multiple testing.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2010.482154"}

The implementation of the Dunnett-based parallel gatekeeping procedure relies on assumptions difficult to justify in typical clinical trials, namely (a) that the joint distribution of the test statistics from different endpoints can be approximated by a multivariate-t distribution and (b) that the true correlation between multiple endpoints can be well estimated using observed data. The proposed Dunnett-Bonferroni-based parallel gatekeeping procedure relaxes the preceding assumptions by splitting type I error rate among families using the Bonferroni inequality. While it is potentially less powerful than a Dunnett-based procedure when both procedures are applicable, the power loss is very minimal. Our proposed method avoids assumptions that might be challenged by regulatory agencies and does so with virtually no cost. Moreover, in most cases this method is easier to implement compared with the Dunnett-based procedure.","inCitations":["38b06f8ab0536a7e5966dc85d53ea24e4e56367d","ae6867f9b232b79985e53c5b55d5f0659ba55cc7","d37ba4ab59f19003efa2668f702f4c1c215a5d61","86329018e2d19074629a9546365bc81a1dd474fe","bb14db2049fa93c922d54fbe39ac9854dae51707","fdfda8d5616d8cbebeab4a1b235a4e5b1ba9276f","3891adc5a439349e05bff78a9a5aa71b3df5cccb","fcdfd757451f850aec23f5047527082344911b3a","b7aa640ac9f5274b48524c73a097dad0ca29a480","fd02bb9d736477fe48569e0d09b3223432703071"],"title":"A Dunnett-Bonferroni-based parallel gatekeeping procedure for dose-response clinical trials with multiple endpoints.","doi":"10.1002/pst.358"}

It was noted that the power of this method is highly dependent on the accuracy of the potency ratio estimated, with low power when the estimate is inaccurate. Additionally, the test used to detect synergy (the Min test) has been shown to be conservative in many practical applications, and non-monotonic alternative tests that have greater power have been proposed.

These methods include use of a Taylor Series expansion to estimate variance, solutions to a quadratic equation, and maximum likelihood methods. In addition, for improvement of the properties of the methods based on large sample approximations, situations where either binomial count was less than or equal to 3 were managed conservatively by having an exact confidence interval for the odds ratio become the confidence interval for its risk ratio counterpart. Methods were initially evaluated by computing confidence limits for certain cases. Second, simulations were used to identify the better methods for controlling the Type I error rate while maintaining power. Last, relationships between methods were evaluated by calculating the percent of disagreement in the decision made regarding non inferiority. Methods in the group using a Taylor Series expansion in variance estimation perform similarly to the Pearson method preferred in the literature.

Applications of these findings are discussed for ratios that arise in randomized clinical trials that are conducted to show noninferiority of a new medical product to a reference control. Consideration is given as well to sample size calculations for noninferiority clinical trials.","inCitations":["0fe4ed84bed0b38c8b49097c8bb0120a5b723594","88308829f72441613d6f2ca0b975fe9a1c14222e","21090822782a90c43dfa39ee1acdd80bc367637e","17252eefb41b9ae118c38a3a5d2826a491aa3285","1030af547cdadd55d0212da624c064bc9a0bc069","0fb156fe24237d21c0852090eff4bfe0ef2d8c5d","f5ae17230ea2cdd4afbdf0e02a8e0c419f5dfa7e","c665de805f6d64ea0b851f6bb62c01ecf5c5049f","7a5ef163440aad35e0578bb529743ce31b01ddc0","2e8289f4b3003b6d0323eadf6e3b5d62b3f2ea46","9888731d3f6c4960a6605d5c1fa31def3ead4723","9541037971c2c3a7c98e6cc0e9cbca104d69e88c","cc6c862f053b7d259e96ff75c8db76aee89489f5","bb81f6488712bf57e247e743c44ff35e21220610","1a50e990add4fc41a8c0442e8fa177b598077b5a","446945bbfffc2397d71b4674a9c5d4ccb3c11d4a","ec839ea7452a8a2b94f213c0440b146278106068"],"title":"Review and evaluation of methods for computing confidence intervals for the ratio of two proportions and considerations for non-inferiority clinical trials.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200040844"}

In this paper, we discuss noninferiority testing in a Fisherian framework, in which the only assumption necessary for inference is the assumption of randomization of treatments to study subjects. Randomization plays an important role in not only the design but also the analysis of clinical trials, no matter the underlying inferential field. The ability to utilize permutation tests depends on assumptions around exchangeability, and we discuss the possible uses of permutation tests in active control noninferiority analyses. The other practical implications of this paper are admittedly minor but lead to better understanding of the historical and philosophical development of active control noninferiority testing. The conclusion may also frame discussion of other complicated issues in noninferiority testing, such as the role of an intention to treat analysis.","inCitations":["7f7adbf7d3f965291529caf599730521d16efda4","5f0c4c6deecaaf59ef7f92ca28fe7962c1f7279f","7f8e2ae23187f365e3d98e2982919620345fe839"],"title":"Randomization as a basis for inference in noninferiority trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.214"}

Prediction of individual air pollution exposure in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funded Multi-Ethnic Study of Atheroscelerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air) study relies on a flexible spatio-temporal prediction model that integrates land-use regression with kriging to account for spatial dependence in pollutant concentrations. Temporal variability is captured using temporal trends estimated via modified singular value decomposition and temporally varying spatial residuals. This model utilizes monitoring data from existing regulatory networks and supplementary MESA Air monitoring data to predict concentrations for individual cohort members. In general, spatio-temporal models are limited in their efficacy for large data sets due to computational intractability. We develop reduced-rank versions of the MESA Air spatio-temporal model. To do so, we apply low-rank kriging to account for spatial variation in the mean process and discuss the limitations of this approach. As an alternative, we represent spatial variation using thin plate regression splines. We compare the performance of the outlined models using EPA and MESA Air monitoring data for predicting concentrations of oxides of nitrogen (NO x )-a pollutant of primary interest in MESA Air-in the Los Angeles metropolitan area via cross-validated R2. Our findings suggest that use of reduced-rank models can improve computational efficiency in certain cases. Low-rank kriging and thin plate regression splines were competitive across the formulations considered, although TPRS appeared to be more robust in some settings.","inCitations":["4587401a9c6b3c908adf5b70c455ad4b7d57323a","dd193a7f18479ee013d5d9dcdd5794c84a46ff12"],"title":"Reduced-Rank Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Air Pollution Concentrations in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS786"}

For meaningful clinical use, an orderly grouping of the T and N categories into a staging system needs to be defined, usually with respect to a time-to-event outcome. This can be reframed as a model selection problem with respect to features arranged on a partially ordered two-way grid, and a penalized regression method is proposed for selecting the optimal grouping. Instead of penalizing the L1-norm of the coefficients like lasso, in order to enforce the stage grouping, we place L1 constraints on the differences between neighboring coefficients. The underlying mechanism is the sparsity-enforcing property of the L1 penalty, which forces some estimated coefficients to be the same and hence leads to stage grouping. Partial ordering constraints is also required as both the T and N categories are ordinal. A series of optimal groupings with different numbers of stages can be obtained by varying the tuning parameter, which gives a tree-like structure offering a visual aid on how the groupings are progressively made. We hence call the proposed method the lasso tree. We illustrate the utility of our method by applying it to the staging of colorectal cancer using survival outcomes. Simulation studies are carried out to examine the finite sample performance of the selection procedure. We demonstrate that the lasso tree is able to give the right grouping with moderate sample size, is stable with regard to changes in the data, and is not affected by random censoring.","inCitations":["7ed2f9d7ff2925db72fb2dbc3d0b5e29809a548b","8380f71953172e5add47fb9c782f28a875c101f0","51aa859982cc7be2a42984341ad9ccafff9954bb","be3f7b3112025217fab72c8e28d7492019f93af2"],"title":"Lasso tree for cancer staging with survival data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs044"}

There is a substantial literature on testing H0 Â :Â Ï1 Â =Â Ï2 , the hypothesis that the population correlation coefficients are equal. However, it is well known that Pearson's correlation is not robust. Even a single outlier can have a substantial impact on Pearson's correlation, resulting in a misleading understanding about the strength of the association among the bulk of the points. A way of mitigating this concern is to use a correlation coefficient that guards against outliers, many of which have been proposed. But apparently there are no results on how to compare dependent robust correlation coefficients when there is heteroscedasicity. Extant results suggest that a basic percentile bootstrap will perform reasonably well. This paper reports simulation results indicating the extent to which this is true when using Spearman's rho, a Winsorized correlation or a skipped correlation.","inCitations":["306139f5ed8bbd0f2d41404392714eff43494ed4","48d8e2511299ac41382eb53107247f5127b8b18b","aa7e25529386c2f28d7065536c075409391b1bde","90bf00bd387a3d10a9930016bcac68eac2cb3c41","1af243da6cc345f8c57219f9f0089d5fe5ba5edc","57f326f7b211c1d8a285c5f802865cf46f5dece0","02cbb0db288af2c83b48a023f245812bd22a2408","eaf22b469336aa836a190bf8da069dd46117a0de","e412444da57e9da1b6787b8494eb72d790a09c05","2fd44adea19be1f0ec5ce4e1dc7ff16cfcab6832","35fcf245f35a4f07d1ed0ad282170292ac0c708b","7c1a2f029844b449886dcf794c1126e9ddd8bfd1","f0a6d94195ec017cd06f499f013d6454b96fbfdd","021567bc49c2752a042af9e50cb0c7130c81ee83","a65bf931a25f5a40b28a06e7944664c1fcd06ae6","9e8633925d588c4bfd91efc7a81aa1b3e4cf3e2f","160ad42dde9b8264234aa8350dca14bfdf578feb","c8ae5f3d9c9033707ffbd1f37e318618ccb6de81","c06bda96c883e67e15d55202639b05abbdbfbece","a4351e049d5fe13706ad91340568b389cd401df4","2cef07f790e4c8a660e11ead745157f06092a340","b5444e4c78aa6bb871f342a0eed529ba052e68ad"],"title":"Comparing dependent robust correlations.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12069"}

The objective is to formally compare white matter tract profiles between healthy individuals and multiple sclerosis patients, as assessed by conventional diffusion tensor imaging measures. We propose to decompose the curves using functional principal component analysis of a mixture process, which we refer to as marginal functional principal component analysis. This approach reduces the dimension of the testing problem in a way that enables the use of traditional nonparametric univariate testing procedures. The procedure is computationally efficient and accommodates different sampling designs. Numerical studies are presented to validate the size and power properties of the test in many realistic scenarios. In these cases, the proposed test has been found to be more powerful than its primary competitor. Application to the diffusion tensor imaging data reveals that all the tracts studied are associated with multiple sclerosis and the choice of the diffusion tensor image measurement is important when assessing axonal disruption.","inCitations":["f2852bf162aab9e651aaa81f4efbb9f7b6bc3485","9e8aef27cea0eb305d1536501cd086ffdf5cba3c","089f7ba8d16d8ad597a21453afdf923cc93fac8b","c6050bfbe755c80b2d9e3549b13be59be62e98c2","2694fa98afe8e45bfbfb02235d6d6ff368574f57","1c65cd5b620e79cf48948ffbb87609bdfc9428f1","130b8ab3faa6d469ce0b56ce7e92ca8f70282794","f143827a13a748e1d44ec3f9690a89fe17de2cb2","ddcf12ebb4618e9e077f9382ad30f9e030a7adf7"],"title":"A Two Sample Distribution-Free Test for Functional Data with Application to a Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study of Multiple Sclerosis.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12130"}

In particular, many researchers regard RRs to be more intuitively interpretable than odds ratios. Although RR regression is a special case of generalized linear models, specifically with a log link function for the binomial (or Bernoulli) outcome, the resulting log-binomial regression does not respect the natural parameter constraints. Because log-binomial regression does not ensure that predicted probabilities are mapped to the [0,1] range, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is often subject to numerical instability that leads to convergence problems. To circumvent these problems, a number of alternative approaches for estimating RR regression parameters have been proposed. One approach that has been widely studied is the use of Poisson regression estimating equations. The estimating equations for Poisson regression yield consistent, albeit inefficient, estimators of the RR regression parameters. We consider the relative efficiency of the Poisson regression estimator and develop an alternative, almost efficient estimator for the RR regression parameters. The proposed method uses near-optimal weights based on a Maclaurin series (Taylor series expanded around zero) approximation to the true Bernoulli or binomial weight function. This yields an almost efficient estimator while avoiding convergence problems. We examine the asymptotic relative efficiency of the proposed estimator for an increase in the number of terms in the series. Using simulations, we demonstrate the potential for convergence problems with standard ML estimation of the log-binomial regression model and illustrate how this is overcome using the proposed estimator. We apply the proposed estimator to a study of predictors of pre-operative use of beta blockers among patients undergoing colorectal surgery after diagnosis of colon cancer.","inCitations":["fea0ade982d6f944465947581a14ec335e436fb7","a220816ef455829f08246e2ff1285d35ef42f305","2ea3259604c312675b5a19a2a1ff74868ff38fe1","2d10c280d4748b97b8d5bd00d60657b850eb8150","9856b9e02e3798766c9247f81b8b0ccb6f40acb8","094fd752cc7ccb8e94f8400b9e7e11970da8e149"],"title":"Almost efficient estimation of relative risk regression.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu012"}

At least four methods are used to estimate the CCC: two (Lin's method, Variance Components) which are defined on the basis that data are normally distributed, and the two others (U-statistics, GEE) which do not assume any particular distribution of the data. Here the four methods are compared with skewed data from a model in which the subject means follow a log-normal distribution while the within-subject variability is assumed to be normally distributed.
