However, there are key sources of exposure model uncertainty when air pollution is modeled, including estimation error and model misspecification. We examine the use of predicted air pollution levels in linear health effect models under a measurement error framework. For the prediction of air pollution exposures, we consider a universal Kriging framework, which may include land-use regression terms in the mean function and a spatial covariance structure for the residuals. We derive the bias induced by estimation error and by model misspecification in the exposure model, and we find that a misspecified exposure model can induce asymptotic bias in the effect estimate of air pollution on health. We propose a new spatial simulation extrapolation (SIMEX) procedure, and we demonstrate that the procedure has good performance in correcting this asymptotic bias. We illustrate spatial SIMEX in a study of air pollution and birthweight in Massachusetts.","inCitations":["0c2f49a240b096a324831ce64f411366623fb6fa","76aef52d969ba565c3a90725ab4a31120f976b09","2fcab5392a7713265935f021d5318b20ae381cde","c48fc5a0219e01247ae45b033c28b4e8d1cdf7e5","c1c510c13c8b2a3302512008d3391930a2db2189","70f96faf65978b0ac2dda4afae7a3744356fd448","f89ec810fe487427c6decc7f0f9ad5ebb557c5a8","2316504bd1bfa8812abe2f0b31c6bdc0d6aa40ed","c5b8ca1af823464e35b1b98227a121d7e18f32e4","250d85b54a0554f16f3e7a826d1f6775a2cda890","0b556cd373f4ba48d4d8997f45d2a4af58f8ecab","0be651670e303b6254511351eec4ed428d576ffe"],"title":"Spatial measurement error and correction by spatial SIMEX in linear regression models when using predicted air pollution exposures.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxv048"}

Multiple imputation is an approach for getting a valid estimation of treatment effects under an assumption of missing at random mechanism. Although there are a variety of multiple imputation methods for the longitudinal binary data, a limited number of researches have reported on relative performances of the methods. Moreover, when focusing on the treatment effect throughout a period that has often been used in clinical evaluations of specific disease areas, no definite investigations comparing the methods have been available. We conducted an extensive simulation study to examine comparative performances of six multiple imputation methods available in the SAS MI procedure for longitudinal binary data, where two endpoints of responder rates at a specified time point and throughout a period were assessed. The simulation study suggested that results from naive approaches of a single imputation with non-responders and a complete case analysis could be very sensitive against missing data. The multiple imputation methods using a monotone method and a full conditional specification with a logistic regression imputation model were recommended for obtaining unbiased and robust estimations of the treatment effect. The methods were illustrated with data from a mental health research.","inCitations":["b54e93a9905517969951774869de0b4d9777591e"],"title":"A comparison of multiple imputation methods for incomplete longitudinal binary data.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1372772"}

Suissa and Shuster (1991) described the exact unconditional test. The most commonly used statistical test in this setting, McNemar's test, is exact conditional on the sum of the discordant pairs. Although asymptotically the conditional and unconditional versions coincide, a long-standing debate surrounds the choice between them. Several power approximations have been studied for both methods (Miettinen, 1968; Bennett and Underwood, 1970; Connett, Smith, and McHugh, 1987; Connor, 1987; Suissa and Shuster, 1991; Lachenbruch, 1992; Lachin, 1992). For the unconditional approach most existing power approximations use the Gaussian distribution, while the accurate (\"exact\") method is computationally burdensome. A new approximation uses the F statistic corresponding to a paired-data T test computed from the difference scores of the binary outcomes. Enumeration of all possible 2 × 2 tables for small sample sizes allowed evaluation of both test size and power. The new approximation compares favorably to others due to the combination of ease of use and accuracy.","inCitations":["0935abb3bcd51c7496b9c9ed49297ba8ec0ec125","fe3448c3122217de529abe2f9313c15cd9cc76c7"],"title":"Approximating Power of the Unconditional Test for Correlated Binary Pairs.","doi":"10.1080/03610919808813494"}

This assumption is violated if there is an unobserved baseline covariate that is informative, namely a baseline covariate associated with both outcome and the probability that the outcome is missing or censored. Incorporating informative covariates in the analysis has the desirable result of ameliorating the violation of this assumption. Although this idea of including informative covariates is recognized in the statistics literature, it is not appreciated in the literature on randomized trials. Moreover, to our knowledge, there has been no discussion on how to incorporate informative covariates into a general likelihood-based analysis with partially missing outcomes to estimate the quantities of interest. Our contribution is a simple likelihood-based approach for using informative covariates to estimate the effect of intervention on a partially missing outcome in a randomized trial. The first step is to create a propensity-to-be-missing score for each randomization group and divide the scores into a small number of strata based on quantiles. The second step is to compute stratum-specific estimates of outcome derived from a likelihood-analysis conditional on the informative covariates, so that the missing-data mechanism is ignorable. The third step is to average the stratum-specific estimates and compute the estimated effect of intervention on outcome. We discuss the computations for univariate, survival, and longitudinal outcomes, and present an application involving a randomized study of dual versus triple combinations of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors.","inCitations":["044197eb01c8874240b3fd4d9229584a5055c54c","7770864b1ef211d7e537a2039569d6d56cac87c8","d58823a4e48073a1f45998689862ae7e732fbb21","dbd754b6d05e78402cb4e5337763e61b84ad61bc","eb3140f5a07b6e456af887c411c6a458d90c09bd","e0b049a28c4858305d0d6cf89f63c354fb42d645","408dce2d6cc6a3cea796e9d2b89e2e88fd717b46","d99f35864dbbd1c1733b7276c11abbf945a09f6e","07aa04eb03b4eac6832028138d4c0b5641b659cf","b4a50008774dafd819d8228bb87cd7963f1b7106"],"title":"Simple adjustments for randomized trials with nonrandomly missing or censored outcomes arising from informative covariates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi038"}

We seek an alternative to Bowker's test in search of methods for simultaneous inference that are valid when the hypothesis of symmetry is false. We apply multivariate normal theory to develop chi-square tests and simultaneous confidence intervals for inferences concerning symmetry in k X k contingency tables. We propose a modified Wald statistic as a competitor to Bowker's test. We also proffer quadratic estimators of confidence intervals. In large samples, the recommended test statistic rejects the null hypothesis at the stated level of significance when the null hypothesis is true and always rejects with greater power than Bowker's test. The proffered interval estimators provide good simultaneous coverage of the pairwise differences between the population proportions at the stated confidence level.","inCitations":["4ecd0ccf122d8b2bdbbd4f62a38a4bd06f208fee","45abf5864631576613273d8f0edea53acf37a53e","46296041bc2969e48fed847b7052c5470a07b0f9","3262403e49524bda115768373b31a2784c7ddda3","a915f78455fb3fd98068bb615aa30f3d254f827b","856e4478f02e800e7b470016a615bf338c4db895"],"title":"Symmetry in square contingency tables: tests of hypotheses and confidence interval construction.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100104195"}

For each neuron a fluorescence trace is measured; this can be seen as a first-order approximation of the neuron's activity over time. Determining the exact time at which a neuron spikes on the basis of its fluorescence trace is an important open problem in the field of computational neuroscience. Recently, a convex optimization problem involving an ℓ1 penalty was proposed for this task. In this paper we slightly modify that recent proposal by replacing the ℓ1 penalty with an ℓ0 penalty. In stark contrast to the conventional wisdom that ℓ0 optimization problems are computationally intractable, we show that the resulting optimization problem can be efficiently solved for the global optimum using an extremely simple and efficient dynamic programming algorithm. Our R-language implementation of the proposed algorithm runs in a few minutes on fluorescence traces of 100,000 timesteps. Furthermore, our proposal leads to substantial improvements over the previous ℓ1 proposal, in simulations as well as on two calcium imaging datasets. R-language software for our proposal is available on CRAN in the package LZeroSpikeInference.

The usual Student's t test of H0: rho = 0 is valid when X and Y are independent, so in particular the conditional variance of Y, given X, does not vary with X. But when the conditional variance does vary with X, Student's t uses an incorrect estimate of the standard error. In effect, when rejecting H0, this might be due to rho not equal to 0, but perhaps the main reason for rejecting is that there is heteroscedasticity. This note compares two heteroscedastic methods for testing H0 and finds that in terms of Type I errors, the nested bootstrap performed best in simulations when using rho. When using one of two robust analogues of rho (Spearman's rho and the percentage bend correlation), little or no advantage was found, in terms of Type I error probabilities, when using a nested bootstrap versus the basic percentile method. As for power, generally an adjusted percentile bootstrap, used in conjunction with r, performed better than the nested bootstrap, even in situations where, for the null case, the estimated probability of a Type I error was lower when using the adjusted percentile method. As for computing a confidence interval when correlations are positive, situations are found where all methods perform in an unsatisfactory manner.","inCitations":["76cb03849bca71b92a3205594909282b05d15534","eef2078a4b10ef28061d7100061c8f6ed89b520b","0eb0bec584b219a2591b0dec266d3720916117ae","058dd776ef768d9e526060010fdccd55a617bd13","70e22327f50cb2c05675282bd6bfdb7fedefc1b2","9a1221e2278d9437679826df1a431862848fc113","48749d413d427d97f88625b788caabb6e425b482","f77bb430d38e4fc61537cfd523a937bd987850ff","2441883a852485a3ca9c2a7c2377a2463d4a01c1","b3a192e01622f85aa66ddf2a7dda42781b859a80","787a7f140e4ec80ca7031e36f74d09e21440d74a","53ec2643c130bffa1ce70dac859d0547203b1b87","7b202799e5fffe79b07d22ec222d75b0b9bd1a75","702c600b2ca5f6ec878b3ecbf7ecb8fe6c827c51","251d27d65ea6e8d96ffc44e4c90be57d5f5b85e6"],"title":"Inferences about correlations when there is heteroscedasticity.","doi":"10.1348/000711001159410"}

Despite their ubiquity as endpoints in cancer studies, such outcomes pose challenges for analysis. In particular, comparisons between studies or patient populations with different surveillance schema may be confounded by differences in visit frequencies. We present a statistical framework based on multistate and hidden Markov models that represents events on a continuous time scale given data with discrete observation times. To demonstrate this framework, we consider the problem of comparing risks of prostate cancer progression across multiple active surveillance cohorts with different surveillance frequencies. We show that the different surveillance schedules partially explain observed differences in the progression risks between cohorts. Our application permits the conclusion that differences in underlying cancer progression risks across cohorts persist after accounting for different surveillance frequencies.","inCitations":["385bf342feaae44fe1856d88b7a5c15cd24cf1aa"],"title":"Estimating and Comparing Cancer Progression Risks under Varying Surveillance Protocols.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1130"}

As the dynamic unfolding of a biological process often involves the activation of genes at different rates, successful clustering in this context requires dealing with varying time and shape patterns simultaneously. This motivates the combination of a novel pairwise warping with a suitable clustering method to discover expression shape clusters. We develop a novel clustering method that combines an initial pairwise curve alignment to adjust for time variation within likely clusters. The cluster-specific time synchronization method shows excellent performance over standard clustering methods in terms of cluster quality measures in simulations and for yeast and human fibroblast data sets. In the yeast example, the discovered clusters have high concordance with the known biological processes.","inCitations":["8147272f15cd9528f5f1dd0f0189305cc395defb","403a23771a6bcafd20caecab316a4f3811eefd5f","54602cd182e43ddc400cc8ad7d4eb4fc6817eb93","54deaef8f672c315ba432fe827d822b86c48aa9b","8a57661289ee77802d1ffd9b457d5bc128b7e228","6d681ebc12b69acfce061b124d7f03ea3d25d65a","ee5b5fb408d2269ac34c331d721ae6ed5e402f91","7a36b40465ce40d943f248ff8696d32b22d5d696","8fb6b1b98efb824338f3ddcf85f8ff23661f0e28","fbab529af18b2825f5699553c11f2c221e6d5723","f566f9487740848f0dc004b9b6addb0332263e8e","1ace3b7ec19fd39cdff1b28c9cb653990b7f23d6","e5bd2c829f00fca6f28adcfef05e9b168971606a","0b77851df89191063b2c48880d64c3840495def6","db7af1f1a8dd19a1d22d80b5663d56c986a8bda2","31d9aa81d453dba10c0c1a6b42ccc71bbbe23b21","0ee6b07802891a53c0ae3dd3b6720d4798652ab9","b0810c675b57aa4d9e4279ac10d1d5fa552f19e3","299b8b1e6290856b1a7d2b7340ec307b9c8681a5","883eb70aee4685dbb588a1356d3326c4c6912172","38a4c29e15b4806d603b0068ae1a7ed31ee148fc","1a89eff5c99c68c2789f101dbf53f16f8234c3fd","7c181b9c6805ae2a8c36ab3ae06b69ab030e8c7e","4941f0fe1c173a02f88e54add16cd3c44cc50f6e","fa74a70407ed67bf6fdfd751988268cfcec52987","b426be16b1750862ce2a61420343fe2a14fed6ce","00369530a6ae1dda3dc566bcaf1fa4b5a31668d7","7ece19d6700f43ac11eef2893910e9d14a3210bd"],"title":"Time-synchronized clustering of gene expression trajectories.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn011"}

In most applications, biologists are interested in detecting differentially methylated regions, composed of multiple sites with differing methylation levels among populations. However, current computational approaches for detecting such regions do not provide accurate statistical inference. A major challenge in reporting uncertainty is that a genome-wide scan is involved in detecting these regions, which needs to be accounted for. A further challenge is that sample sizes are limited due to the costs associated with the technology. We have developed a new approach that overcomes these challenges and assesses uncertainty for differentially methylated regions in a rigorous manner. Region-level statistics are obtained by fitting a generalized least squares regression model with a nested autoregressive correlated error structure for the effect of interest on transformed methylation proportions. We develop an inferential approach, based on a pooled null distribution, that can be implemented even when as few as two samples per population are available. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of our method using both experimental data and Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the new method improves the specificity and sensitivity of lists of regions and accurately controls the false discovery rate.","inCitations":["60d826df59cefaa25e39a556fba40bc35549ff1a","f6c2c34852d3f34d103cdf68cfe77443656b5b52","e27fc90d2da9fcbac2cb4beb9ea5ef77a53544d7","0604b9c1debdb8169bb67ade96efdddf710b512b","b48d4f0bb6cec3d8e5f89e9e00224882e7903f07","3fbb9d7ebc41764917611aae13124ff3c295ea5c","936c4827bdbd32221cc1e1e24c5fbc4e84b93376","d4b2fe8022547658dd697118449f6f868c8e9da2","931beafbec553f47e18ae0f4e4082058ba341319","fc9e4af0828f160218b3aa92d556a951ee5b18f5","edbafefc34d3c7c8a968c93e164db64cff68dfbd","b7ef3e7dbb2baeccc50a935e2a2bfde517984985","1d176ea97031f32d48dc751c929b1748c18624d4","56bcb14ab56047476e8b67b706aea2b1c22b9e72","84caf379f7a94f31248beefb2d79df65625ea7ff","f489d90eb4aaf5aaad66b728f9d3f625497e9051"],"title":"Detection and accurate false discovery rate control of differentially methylated regions from whole genome bisulfite sequencing.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy007"}

We present statistical methods for relating TMA data to censored time-to-event data. We review methods for evaluating the predictive power of Cox regression models and show how to test whether biomarker data contain predictive information above and beyond standard pathology covariates. We use nonparametric bootstrap methods to validate model fitting indices such as the concordance index. We also present data mining methods for characterizing high risk patients with simple biomarker rules. Since researchers in the TMA community routinely dichotomize biomarker expression values, survival trees are a natural choice.

Guidance for Industry on Statistical Approaches to Establishing Bioequivalence; Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration: Rockville, MD, 2001]. The recommended replicated crossover design not only allows estimates of both the inter-subject and the intra-subject variabilities and the variability due to subject-by-formulation interaction, but also provides an assessment of average bioequivalence (ABE). In this article, power function for assessment of ABE under a general replicated crossover design (i.e., a 2 x 2m replicated crossover design) based on the traditional analysis of variance model and the mixed effects model as suggested by the FDA are studied. It is found that the power of a 2 x 2m replicated crossover design depends upon the variability due to subject-by-formulation interaction and the number of replicates. Based on the derived power function, formula for sample size calculation for assessment of ABE under a 2 x 2m replicated crossover design is also provided.","inCitations":["0c1136f7b87a147748df19a2dc45225ca314fd6b","b5ee9ac97ffba12e0f7f83a626a76baa4e316e53","54c0058fb47f38a57701216c8b9ace5e5fbd998b"],"title":"On statistical power for average bioequivalence testing under replicated crossover designs.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120014560"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2018,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"Noncompliance or non-adherence to randomized treatment is a common challenge when interpreting data from randomized clinical trials. The effect of an intervention if all participants were forced to comply with the assigned treatment (i.e., the causal effect) is often of primary scientific interest. For example, in trials of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes, policymakers are interested in their effect on smoking behavior if their use were to be compelled by regulation. A variety of statistical methods to estimate the causal effect of an intervention have been proposed, but these methods, including inverse probability of compliance weighted (IPCW) estimators, assume that participants' compliance statuses are reported without error. This is an untenable assumption when compliance is based on self-report. Biomarkers (e.g., nicotine levels in the urine) may provide more reliable indicators of compliance but cannot perfectly discriminate between compliers and non-compliers. However, by modeling the distribution of the biomarker as a mixture distribution and writing the probability of compliance as a function of the mixture components, we show how the probability of compliance can be directly estimated from the data even when compliance status is unknown. To estimate the causal effect, we develop a new approach which re-weights participants by the product of their probability of compliance given the observed data and the inverse probability of compliance given confounders. We show that our proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal and show that in some situations the proposed approach is more efficient than standard IPCW estimators. We demonstrate via simulation that the proposed estimator achieves smaller bias and greater efficiency than ad hoc approaches to estimating the causal effect when compliance is measured with error. We apply our method to data from a recently completed randomized trial of VLNC cigarettes.","inCitations":["f6cc3635566f8f0d9433fdcb5eb99ecda14e7321","979ca852ae8f24ec7c1431af5ee47d624565d698","b6d860de827c18ec9a7a494c214704ac2ee859ad","da337b7a1af649c3a53e692faf0194570ac3c534","1aace5919bc8214cb6fc868de6b885f1a3aed014"],"title":"Estimating causal effects from a randomized clinical trial when noncompliance is measured with error.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx029"}
