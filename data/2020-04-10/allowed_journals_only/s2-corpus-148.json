Here we develop an estimator of the error variance that can borrow information across genes using the James-Stein shrinkage concept. A new test statistic (FS) is constructed using this estimator. The new statistic is compared with other statistics used to test for differential expression: the gene-specific F test (F1), the pooled-variance F statistic (F3), a hybrid statistic (F2) that uses the average of the individual and pooled variances, the regularized t-statistic, the posterior odds statistic B, and the SAM t-test. The FS-test shows best or nearly best power for detecting differentially expressed genes over a wide range of simulated data in which the variance components associated with individual genes are either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Thus FS provides a powerful and robust approach to test differential expression of genes that utilizes information not available in individual gene testing approaches and does not suffer from biases

As the existing multiple comparison procedures based on maximum likelihood estimation could be computationally intensive, we propose to construct multiple comparison procedures based on composite likelihood method. The new test statistics account for the correlation structure within the clusters and are computationally convenient to compute. Simulation studies show that the composite likelihood based procedures maintain good control of the familywise type I error rate in the presence of intra-cluster correlation, whereas ignoring the correlation leads to erratic performance.","inCitations":["a148d51355a9ff39caef1950df9542f87881c245"],"title":"Multiple Comparisons Using Composite Likelihood in Clustered Data","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2016-0004"}

The functional predictor is projected onto a large number of smooth eigenvectors and the coefficient function is estimated using penalized spline regression; confidence intervals based on the mixed model framework are obtained. Our method can be applied to many functional data designs including functions measured with and without error, sparsely or densely sampled. The methods also extend to the case of multiple functional predictors or functional predictors with a natural multilevel structure. The approach can be implemented using standard mixed effects software and is computationally fast. The methodology is motivated by a study of white-matter demyelination via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The aim of this study is to analyze differences between various cerebral white-matter tract property measurements of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls.

While such regulations are predicated on the presumed relationships between emissions, ambient air pollution, and human health, many of these relationships have never been empirically verified. The goal of this paper is to develop new statistical methods to quantify these relationships. We frame this problem as one of mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which the effect of a particular control technology on ambient pollution is mediated through causal effects on power plant emissions. Since power plants emit various compounds that contribute to ambient pollution, we develop new methods for multiple intermediate variables that are measured contemporaneously, may interact with one another, and may exhibit joint mediating effects. Specifically, we propose new methods leveraging two related frameworks for causal inference in the presence of mediating variables: principal stratification and causal mediation analysis. We define principal effects based on multiple mediators, and also introduce a new decomposition of the total effect of an intervention on ambient pollution into the natural direct effect and natural indirect effects for all combinations of mediators. Both approaches are anchored to the same observed-data models, which we specify with Bayesian nonparametric techniques. We provide assumptions for estimating principal causal effects, then augment these with an additional assumption required for causal mediation analysis. The two analyses, interpreted in tandem, provide the first empirical investigation of the presumed causal pathways that motivate important air quality regulatory policies.","inCitations":["fa3701a731d9ad242c1f65a201f819abdfc1541d","65750aeb33ac580a5e3f106bf61561ae772cdebc","5a0638f946234dd863b78286d5d6a5542eb9d2dc","ffe56110c5e0fb9b561edfbfb45008087fb69640","7748b6336b267805f94a5a1d143cf9ed5cf0f3f4"],"title":"Bayesian Methods for Multiple Mediators: Relating Principal Stratification and Causal Mediation in the Analysis of Power Plant Emission Controls.","doi":"10.1214/19-aoas1260"}

A useful estimating equation procedure was recently proposed by Chen et al. (2002) for linear transformation models to jointly estimate parametric and nonparametric terms. They showed that this procedure can yield a consistent and robust estimator. However, the problem of variable selection for linear transformation models is less studied, partially because a convenient loss function is not readily available under this context. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to achieve both sparse and consistent estimation for linear transformation models. The main idea is to derive a profiled score from the estimating equation of Chen et al. (2002), construct a loss function based on the profile scored and its variance, and then minimize the loss subject to some shrinkage penalty. Under regularity conditions, we have shown that the resulting estimator is consistent for both model estimation and variable selection. Furthermore, the estimated parametric terms are asymptotically normal and can achieve higher efficiency than that yielded from the estimation equations. For computation, we suggest a one-step approximation algorithm which can take advantage of the LARS and build the entire solution path efficiently. Performance of the new procedure is illustrated through numerous simulations and real examples including one microarray data.","inCitations":["b4627cb676c2714110658956b15cb72b9c34531c","4d2b8ceb9c3f94f190f98f557b09b8eddd990568","81600d185571b46744cb3fb66f979b5d7dde6fdb","aacfbb7df53bd676a107a2c00e94dd871617cc28","341ca1161457ca4a5854c2725a731a4ed825ce8e","43432e95c5c4d052e7a2f50b95773959faa49a04","4b472c035fd180bc42286bdde619309b3f6d857c","d917411e8861fa4c10243257e6e5d14f9e3f8111","80c723d637ef64f7e05c3f160d0a3a6cf1bdad66"],"title":"On sparse estimation for semiparametric linear transformation models","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2010.01.015"}

Pollard and Richardson drew attention to the fact that the reasoning behind statistical tests does not lead to logically justifiable conclusions. In this paper statistical inferences are defended not by logic but by the standards of everyday reasoning. Aristotle invented formal logic, but argued that people mostly get at the truth with the aid of enthymemes--incomplete syllogisms which include arguing from examples, analogies and signs. It is proposed that statistical tests work in the same way--in that they are based on examples, invoke the analogy of a model and use the size of the effect under test as a sign that the chance hypothesis is unlikely. Of existing theories of statistical inference only a weak version of Fisher's takes this into account. Aristotle anticipated Fisher by producing an argument of the form that there were too many cases in which an outcome went in a particular direction for that direction to be plausibly attributed to chance. We can therefore conclude that Aristotle would have approved of statistical inference and there is a good reason for calling this form of statistical inference classical.","inCitations":["2ae7bb38081144dedae6c19e5d417fa5ef8934cf","b85ba0e14c4e7dca643ead4e15cd5e2989042198","7815cb12348e2ece086cf3321ebebbc31c965af2"],"title":"Statistical inference and Aristotle's Rhetoric.","doi":"10.1348/0007110042307186"}

In this article, the properties of the proposed estimators are studied. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the difference between two estimators. The unblind estimators for the population mean and the population variance perform better than those of the blind estimators in terms of bias and mean square errors in the most of cases. Given a particular sample size, the accuracies of the blind means and the blind variances depend on the treatment proportions in each stratum. An example of interim analysis is given in this article to illustrate the use of sample size determination. The proposed sample size calculations are recommended in the interim analyses to meet Committee for Proprietary Medical Products requirement, retaining the blinding.","inCitations":["f90556aa8377d436a4ff4fdc8c4e3524479729f3"],"title":"Sample Size Re-Estimation without Breaking the Blind in Clinical Trial.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.971168"}

This article addresses the problem of assessing the relative improvement due to weights using simulated data generated around an alcoholic hepatitis trial. We argue that weights yield improved results in terms of bias, coverage rate, and efficiency only when the underlying missingness mechanism is correctly specified.","inCitations":["ab691486fec4b22fb8994b59bd29901e1d265d68","460a037f3a078c3c85150a7ec3451e619b1e5953","d0d92499650db6e72e44a19507ee3117d796be20"],"title":"Assessment of relative improvement due to weights within generalized estimating equations framework for incomplete clinical trials data.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200035493"}

Through a simulation study, we evaluated performances of different C-QTc modeling with different dependent variables, covariates, and covariance structures. This simulation study shows that C-QTc models with ΔQTc being dependent variable without time effect inflate false negative rate and that fitting C-QTc models with different dependent variables, covariates, and covariance structures impacts the control of false negative and false positive rates.

The vast amount of data and biases introduced by sequencing and/or genome mapping pose new challenges and call for effective methods and fast computer programs for statistical analysis. To systematically model ChIP-seq data, we build a dynamic signal profile for each chromosome and then model the profile using a fully Bayesian hidden Ising model. The proposed model naturally takes into account spatial dependency and global and local distributions of sequence tags. It can be used for one-sample and two-sample analyses. Through model diagnosis, the proposed method can detect falsely enriched regions caused by sequencing and/or mapping errors, which is usually not offered by the existing hypothesis-testing-based methods. The proposed method is illustrated using 3 transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq data sets and 2 mixed ChIP-seq data sets and compared with 4 popular and/or well-documented methods: MACS, CisGenome, BayesPeak, and SISSRs. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves equivalent or higher sensitivity and spatial resolution in detecting TF binding sites with false discovery rate at a much lower level.","inCitations":["992a40a1fc33a6ba60283506a183de3d16fd17b0","1b11eadb3f0ced5a3023df23ffff07930588994c","7f4ba62e758b08786cf3d1ffe81e92e2108b6054","a6f98b8ca92c5889d0c73c0ac328929b578b5154","19584b81ee654743db53e0448f8cdd6c3976564d","53c2a2f1a2738f18dc4527d3c4497e5df4499ee9","c786ea3234cac997d1e8e180890afe259863c260","3f5f5319c96bdf97e5b0e39694d25752730bd98c","6714afed9c76b17dc4f30e1dcaadd5a7fd98d8af","1e50657c10c75dbf6a96e99e2c828d6427a6c802","5044635c778a4a3c8f1cf523157a08611dd72f4e","67e58ef2da3d1b202989b7c40b074c0df377dd64","5da4294a9e08ba800c7005de992c31f9fab296b5","3142418c2c58cdbb072615d9e021bb33f2c3c715","e31d807c1c4465cfe13d6bf47b507bb1bb9bb284","3a03777aca0d159f2fcb8bc72c020480b6b495cc","a4d2c35269473d548593c03037f3cba634dff0dd"],"title":"A fully Bayesian hidden Ising model for ChIP-seq data analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr029"}

Statistical methods for the analysis of such data use either parametric (e.g., Weibull) or semi-nonparametric (e.g., Cox) proportional hazard models, modified to include random effects (frailty) which account for the correlation of repeated occurrences of behaviors within a unit (dyad). However, dyad-specific random effects by themselves are not able to account for the ordering of event occurrences within dyads. The occurrence of an event (behavior) can make further occurrences of the same behavior to be more or less likely during an interaction. This paper develops event-dependent random effects models for analyzing repeated behaviors data using a Bayesian approach. The models are illustrated by a dataset relating to emotion regulation in families with children who have behavioral or emotional problems.","inCitations":["d4270f634c435143523a484d6635512bbd77f4c9","7c7be27303e41c4a65f9cb10d2ba6716b96d7c46"],"title":"Bayesian Analysis of Repeated Events Using Event-dependent Frailty Models: an Application to Behavioral Observation Data.","doi":"10.1080/03610920902737118"}

Furthermore, we show that the proposed procedure is as asymptotically efficient as the local polynomial regression estimator when there are no outliers and the error distribution is a Gaussian distribution.

Missing data are common in such studies and predictors can be correlated with subject-specific effects. Maximum likelihood methods for generalized linear mixed models provide consistent estimates when the data are `missing at random' (MAR) but can produce inconsistent estimates in settings where the random effects are correlated with one of the predictors. On the other hand, conditional maximum likelihood methods (and closely related maximum likelihood methods that partition covariates into between- and within-cluster components) provide consistent estimation when random effects are correlated with predictors but can produce inconsistent covariate effect estimates when data are MAR. Using theory, simulation studies, and fits to example data this paper shows that decomposition methods using complete covariate information produce consistent estimates. In some practical cases these methods, that ostensibly require complete covariate information, actually only involve the observed covariates. These results offer an easy-to-use approach to simultaneously protect against bias from both cluster-level confounding and MAR missingness in assessments of change.","inCitations":["e73ffe0436e6645bca6836bd67142dbaae68fc76","e6374b1c01d7cd570b847f939d14fc8fb5692307","4a6f228329a908c1d2da5e513ab1d054f96937ca"],"title":"Covariate Decomposition Methods for Longitudinal Missing-at-random Data and Predictors Associated with Subject-specific Effects.","doi":"10.1111/anzs.12093"}

Estimating a conditional density function from the contaminated expression data is a key aspect of statistical inference and visualization in these studies. We propose re-weighted deconvolution kernel methods to estimate the conditional density function in an additive error model, when the error distribution is known as well as when it is unknown. Theoretical properties of the proposed estimators are investigated with respect to the mean absolute error from a \"double asymptotic\" view. Practical rules are developed for the selection of smoothing-parameters. Simulated examples and an application to an Illumina bead microarray study are presented to illustrate the viability of the methods.","inCitations":["648ad5c9152e4982a02acfa492443681e33f6cc9","41e3e533308ba3828176b522ccf572362bb83d15","a18aa4dcc5f816655cfb09f4fe688abd9db8965a","aafac4cb5388269405c0b48ea53e35d85d41dad1"],"title":"Conditional density estimation in measurement error problems","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2014.08.011"}
