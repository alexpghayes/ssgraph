In the first step, a pilot BE trial is conducted to evaluate the acceptability of the test drug product as a candidate for further evaluation in a subsequent pivotal BE trial. In the second step, a full-scale pivotal BE trial is conducted to formally establish bioequivalence. The objective and criterion of a pilot BE trial are different from those of a pivotal BE trial. In practice, however, a pilot BE trial is often inappropriately designed and analyzed based on the criterion for a pivotal BE trial. One main reason is the lack of well-established design and analysis methods for a pilot BE trial. To close this gap in practice, this study proposes a Pilot Acceptance Range method specfically constructed for analyzing a pilot BE trial within the framework of a two-step strategy. For designing a crossover pilot BE trial, this paper derives the power function and provides an easy-to-use method for determining the sample size.","inCitations":["892ac327beb798cd50282b1f0ca62a715611ca92","60ee5dfabac5938ce4a3e1d6d1e2be7107be55be","ea1f6108acafd59f95affd489e7671841fc7c92e","2d9ec8d86713be9cb29f267e196e3adf422f5059"],"title":"Average bioequivalence evaluation: general methods for pilot trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400500508887"}

It also considers whether the initial value for an individual is a useful predictor of the slope for that individual. The problems are formulated in terms of regression models with random coefficients. The solutions are illustrated using data from an observational study of clinical correlates of disability and progression in Huntington's disease.","inCitations":["e608d3d8fb46f2b71d12b6696f04d67315dd445b","b9670ce7b0da603794ffdd863ac44f4d2508f12e","125eaa0e3cb118b33cdea97e8bb97cd34fbd78bd","fd079be5218a25fc095765f727cceec3d4307df9","335ed079dc0c8391c442a372c5e2789c3f73d413"],"title":"On the relation between initial value and slope.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi017"}

It is also of interest to rank the relative importance of various clinical factors for tooth loss. A multivariate survival tree procedure is proposed. The procedure is built on a parametric exponential frailty model, which leads to greater computational efficiency. We adopted the goodness-of-split pruning algorithm of LeBlanc and Crowley (1993) to determine the best tree size. In addition, the variable importance method is extended to trees grown by goodness-of-fit using an algorithm similar to the random forest procedure in Breiman (2001). Simulation studies for assessing the proposed tree and variable importance methods are presented. To limit the final number of meaningful prognostic groups, an amalgamation algorithm is employed to merge terminal nodes that are homogenous in tooth survival. The resulting prognosis rules and variable importance rankings seem to offer simple yet clear and insightful interpretations.","inCitations":["bf847dd29282f03454f4805061c3e7765d3c08bc","00f5027e32395900d15d7b95ff152eb4898846c1","2d65037cca21eb766e65affd2ddc84b8e383c217","9b088b4c9df26746b23837d0061afdd5a796005c","bdc157db7c101679cff85ef5d952d7bcb2532477","cc3c89685486bbd8f2445b998aa4e7da02e9efa0","d86803d1705653d1f414b204734f7cbcda68e3cf","7e9f1435a51530408db91056a59b7a350aa5ca8b","84f576f020e700e26287c3e0707c76a3c92e0617"],"title":"Multivariate exponential survival trees and their application to tooth prognosis","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.10.019"}

The editors explain in a short accompanying note (Diggle and Zeger, 2009) that ‘we wish to encourage the practice of making research published in the journal reproducible by others’. Peng’s proposal follows an earlier commentary byPeng and others (2006) that had caught the attention of the influential journal Annals of Internal Medicine(cf. Laine and others, 2007). I agree that it is commendable to be able to reproduce the statistical calculations that a group of authors has done, and Peng has put much care into developing a framework that should allow precise documentation of data and computer code. Hopefully, the focus on reproducibility will enhance the level of documentation of original research data and of the actual calculations that were done, a documentation which may sometimes leave quite a bit to be desired. Peng’s editorial also actively encourages others to conduct “alternative analyses.” This could sometimes be constructive if the purpose was to develop new methodology, but then the term “reproducible” is a misnomer. From the context, it seems that the purpose of these alternative analyses concerns the substantive issues, and my intention with this note is to point out that this is less innocent than it may look at first glance. We have severe caricatures in our tradition that should make us careful. There is usually much more to “research” than the statistical analysis, and there is much more to the statistical analysis than the correctness of calculations. A reasonable choice of statistical model (here “correct” is not a meaningful descriptor) requires deep insight into the substantive context, but it is quite unclear how a satisfactory role for the substantive context is assured in the new system. We should avoid encouraging the already far too widespread occurrence of poorly informed reanalyses of old data sets about which the statistician knows almost nothing, a culture that apparently bothers editors of (other!) statistical journals surprisingly little. In my view, there is no guarantee that the “reproduction” that comes out of this culture will benefit science.","inCitations":["b36b4ca211fc3f2a93b22c121063dea389a35a7e","a7757cc619b1262fdbead3fe97b99d79a19ba5c3","85f8673588a164158f8143ca17e2610cc1c47740","6720edcea05b31a9b9a6db98ee71e8ed31efdc38","a30de4d203da15156d565a63e6437501af9285ab","90eb17aade363e5403bb5606b5a94086610ecb7e","2153831e5a3df907b052b9c3cf6006da149d1cd3","4802cbcd88c56b05ab6b097f3d60fc8e6d70a1b0","d37dcacfda075a43a87aa505f545c7bf8ac37f3c","4aea1631fdb23361a8f0aee80fa3d801b13477dc","9d80d0fa8211becc9e7045d270c61a7a24c45719"],"title":"Reproducible research and the substantive context.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq033"}

To motivate the developments, initially a short overview of research is presented, demonstrating that in many cases the widely used coefficient alpha is an unsatisfactory index of scale reliability already at the population level.

The described approach is illustrated with several numerical examples and its performance compared with that of coefficient alpha.","inCitations":["48c7b350e8c4b8eae2462cec90b214c8fc26e198","1b49da3b9768edd0abb82bb223abd64eeed1e325","aa657511bc12cf8726ff9f6db164112e84bf664a","515133b88c1657016980790c80447d26a2ccde69","7f1e01381b9cea5cbaab8c6973bb09da7c0fd8be","a7f2d286a9b544bf48dc63b539a13b2853839184","d823fd53fa020bd7f5fe03ad49dd3ab3051cc9c0","cc640a16326dfa1310a80504d3270a6ad63e2ebe","48674c9e5074928046cb905b4fb418258be8103d","4c40166dc8dc95494051320c1cd55afe3f5f9f40","09c4acd34822f063f61aadb18b2bacad5cace85b","8ce6829001c8fd331a9f0019b80f067d325e1e2e","8fac2b864e7e55cf17031d523f69dea9f39af2a1","633defe1cc79ed6cfbf09e08a8c4e90a725c47b5","fe036ba7a1986a93ea145de8bb3159967365cb73","c386c43059ced0b014399c71f7820644f214a4b6","1dc5314f83968f053ca894e89d11093e7bc5ad73","7467d8a2a610582255b360ab8d5ce9499fccc37b","433655e3ce75bbadbb567acfb047f5fb0b42187b","77ebeb4640bcf03d429065cd318473e660efc436","4d6028ebd254ae4c889980047c9d853aa402d501","f9b236baaef55451e284a9f07c6e0a58648e9fa8","27e50be1f76641e8743f9b85a0d9d8631cf122b3","e38d25c3ad9be9a983c82ece83d453ecabbe70a7","afd0133fffda2a6f3ecabfeef2c82e9452e02a14","87f6d98f0177f3097a0882a288f68fcca352271b","57f57e36db5b153128309e9f98b14417f4b77959","905f06bff760d4bafd107751dbc25d36abe62633","8df4a85801016f888ced27d4186e0fffb7de5899","c7602caaba3c1240510bd1b2ee338303e5d2ecb4","637899c399db7b16565fa9e8ec62d464ffcb6f69","9cf8e4c5eaa697c6b68e651d9e06895f72c39974","a6df0df724d8410c1bf9a158179c0286da80517d","497ba83da1817ae6bdf27c09274484b760c3a3ef","d62f104186c7dc8528787fd649c2265969cc1bb7","e49af2b37f0d7d592ee247b74c3cc9ee6c961fb8","678e55fb389678dad52654400b66a281b5d042fc","40f58830ffccef37fb63eb853777a3c6cbab8cca","25b6895b3a65acc8fbbd8cd375a17e3022acc584","d644be53a19d787ddf5368efd8e0942701cc8d65","eaf312a6665ac155f2b342da9b92ff91f8adc54c","8c5a48ca1b251a92c21d65d52373af1918aa75f8","9af25167753a2dbd9f1d167f0b74a017cba50f1f","9133ededff9836edb35fe37e3cd6cf4ed78a93fb","3d024e1143f1c99c5d20a287e8831bc9dc6a280d","074e18b5d28bd983b09bbeae7f26fd8dd2f2c517","d701f79009aec06b40b997e1e2cf512dd377b9a4","31a0a7bd13877576f600f4423ad9c862deb788ca","b4a88cc9c3c6858200ee6e537262264ee653c04a","83d57c3cd9513fd76960f6104263d8c5bb6bf078","3a7b01a2ba43c4d314fdce50ac39dbe2cb6f9849","76db817142cf185c529b1703fd3ac85bf11c50d6","93367758d3a2f3fe0f205650ccd6fd33bba897e8","a31be81ad09ba2cb84f43332c5b734e41d34b372","40299e371c5d3e1ccc0992daedcba3abbee92a9a","1ce9d64262c2069d33e043ed9c4e2f092ba48df8","c8406630732d78e7d5044090db573c31d3e1ecbc","db00249782e5ab83bf0f06de5fa4dfc37a2635fb","091c511cdfd389a53e53fe034cbd19951a77764e","a7354c59881379b2e463d5cc1664043dbf04c722","75a1c7e79cb3dd7846a14f3844254789b0e74351","1c4eb2ca45125ce9067388f3d6c5ae8e200b89d6","53117a950c118a6d76c8afbf9947687dfb25e8d4","74a542ba9c18fc5a12c91bd441541023d987c79b","c62597e364ba7b38dcbee53b9704ef67cbe75d5d","4711e6a7d27a2657e792d929168be1716181b1b1","d135e3ea5ab9bd1fde98c4d65eb6d2a78f7032ac","9446f79196cf63defd7c6e7052faa004a9c59109","3319ea6e267a55a39b16b0f819baebc847e3cef5","3ed69b12de9299e7c1acb8457e17958961ac8ec5","409b0a30af12a823918e05ce0f21b9ac981e4261","dc7886824478895317e7d001092ef6fbb8249860","0bf017577a31531f47dd5fc2c92769bb8b3bcb42","77cf3ea016a8bdaeae25cb3da01f549c7a4941db","bfa9a84a18fa9dbf0a9bae7a03e39d22285b61b7","24f3b98e42f7600f3d07c8381981a798e829779e","1828517135bdc5850f192994fb58c85a22564858","a74b833cdd7af2ec3d3beb05783484c548d20609","2741bfd8bfedaf1cb52e749360ef43042b6d8cad","1aaa329abb0700e5f948b58f6bc5cd495a71d26a","eb4d7cdd94ca0ae5d9eb431874e6f60c30179894","372823fc5b048301577d7124d455d79d2c16872d","078fff9e3723cd482b6d9152fffe9e8433c9bcf6","2be1e3fe29ba8d3faa8df480fd70aeea2d25075f","d98159f3aa15d30ff4e54968c26ba64c6506ca67","1ee545e84d813825875c6e8bee013bd7fbe8eccb","a7627b57d10471d83222222c8802bdab1985f190","b73058f45f495ae72837b40c7f8edc6bfa1ece28","c6e2fd5528ab63bdccc968d331d49ed30e139679","e92e6ddd5821a1bd726bb1277939f4f2b0fde0c0","d17b342ac5dbd06dbfed400496078deaa5ccce4d","5369feca2a093dff9e128d7f03b79b193bffd411","98bee48a6f96d331e9c7da97cd72523e148b1626","09dfe0b594a172d475c29a17ae40807c31635b8f","38cd971ec949c7963066ca8028a89a5c6b9371ce","840951f08e74166ddee1eb6f00ed3469a65961a1","5f2603b3a71039636290350ab3c15f32daa6c2cf","d14f1cf76e7e8b861e2d292acbc34b1e697323de","424315c1d8f4522ed6732410aff8a9f4068117db","afca1a238ebaa6a34191402daa87abe531349c89","5a2d3403dd72bc4f0ce17ccafa43029abdf1314f","a421e3c4a6b3ad012aeef2bc3ec36a07be8d76e3","c6998df6612ad83e7be39de76577441b2c651359","1dafd2b8912dd52e3fe5932644321ad1ecafb84a","86895c3ddb5b0f4ff3df66bb13c8c0fdbd9a6543"],"title":"Estimation of congeneric scale reliability using covariance structure analysis with nonlinear constraints.","doi":"10.1348/000711001159582"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2013,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of statistical planning and inference","paperAbstract":"Most statistical methods for microarray data analysis consider one gene at a time, and they may miss subtle changes at the single gene level. This limitation may be overcome by considering a set of genes simultaneously where the gene sets are derived from prior biological knowledge. We call a pathway as a predefined set of genes that serve a particular cellular or physiological function. Limited work has been done in the regression settings to study the effects of clinical covariates and expression levels of genes in a pathway on a continuous clinical outcome. A semiparametric regression approach for identifying pathways related to a continuous outcome was proposed by Liu et al. (2007), who demonstrated the connection between a least squares kernel machine for nonparametric pathway effect and a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) for variance components. However, the asymptotic properties on a semiparametric regression for identifying pathway have never been studied. In this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of the parameter estimates on semiparametric regression and compare Liu et al.'s REML with our REML obtained from a profile likelihood. We prove that both approaches provide consistent estimators, have [Formula: see text] convergence rate under regularity conditions, and have either an asymptotically normal distribution or a mixture of normal distributions. However, the estimators based on our REML obtained from a profile likelihood have a theoretically smaller mean squared error than those of Liu et al.'s REML. Simulation study supports this theoretical result. A profile restricted likelihood ratio test is also provided for the non-standard testing problem. We apply our approach to a type II diabetes data set (Mootha et al., 2003).","inCitations":["00f5027e32395900d15d7b95ff152eb4898846c1","09cea80681594d43dba12cbd259f793342af4cc7","6fd56536193807de03f6fab4d2b4ee9f367ec7d3","9f90b8bc5c0ad65781cd4131b3a1e7511369183a"],"title":"Statistical properties on semiparametric regression for evaluating pathway effects.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2012.09.009"}

At the same time, the framework is embedded in the generalized linear mixed models, such that non-Gaussian, e.g., binary, outcomes can be studied as well. Similarities and, above all, important differences are studied.

However, very few applied studies are careful about incorporating the survey design with the propensity score analysis, which may mean that the results do not generate population inferences. This may be because few methodological studies examine how to best combine these methods. Furthermore, even fewer of them investigate different non‐response mechanisms. This study examines methods for handling survey weights in propensity score matching analyses of survey data under different non‐response mechanisms. Our main conclusions are: (i) whether the survey weights are incorporated in the estimation of the propensity score does not impact estimation of the population treatment effect, as long as good population treated‐comparison balance is achieved on confounders, (ii) survey weights must be used in the outcome analysis, and (iii) the transferring of survey weights (i.e., assigning the weights of the treated units to the comparison units matched to them) can be beneficial under certain non‐response mechanisms.","inCitations":["42853f7c3e2a340374102d4081e04aace122a2a9","d14cba34990d29a6f5878f368f275fca762f2ad4","1fb99eb350c1ae182b949d965a248c238491b398","e3d0636b7c5d5765a6f278771d9fabcdda12dcfe","e38f87bac984994bbe9e0c7b4a505ed9edc052fc"],"title":"It's all about balance: propensity score matching in the context of complex survey data","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx063"}

Thus, studying disease-haplotype association using unphased genotype data is essentially a problem of handling a missing covariate in a case-control design. There are several methods for estimating a disease-haplotype association parameter in a matched case-control study. Here we propose a conditional likelihood approach for inference regarding the disease-haplotype association using unphased genotype data arising from a matched case-control study design. The proposed method relies on a logistic disease risk model and a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) among the control population only. We develop an expectation and conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm for jointly estimating the haplotype frequency and the disease-haplotype association parameter(s). We apply the proposed method to analyze the data from the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer prevention study, and a matched case-control study of breast cancer patients conducted in Israel. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated via simulation studies.","inCitations":["aaaa2b08b3112190b0f6ee278c624544765732f4"],"title":"Inference of the Haplotype Effect in a Matched Case-Control Study Using Unphased Genotype Data","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1079"}

Immunogenicity can negatively affect patients, ranging from mild reactive effect to hypersensitivity reactions or even serious autoimmune diseases. Assessment of immunogenicity is critical as the ADAs can adversely impact the efficacy and safety of the drug products. Well-developed and validated immunogenicity assays are required by the regulatory agencies as tools for immunogenicity assessment. Key to the development and validation of an immunogenicity assay is the determination of a cut point, which serves as the threshold for classifying patients as ADA positive(reactive) or negative. In practice, the cut point is determined as either the quantile of a parametric or nonparametric empirical distribution. The parametric method, which is often based on a normality assumption, may lead to biased cut point estimates when the normality assumption is violated. The non-parametric method, which yields unbiased estimates of the cut point, may have low efficiency when the sample size is small. As the distribution of immune responses are often skewed and sometimes heavy-tailed, we propose two non-normal random effects models for cut point determination. The random effects, following a skew-t or log-gamma distribution, can incorporate the skewed and heavy-tailed responses and the correlation among repeated measurements. Simulation study is conducted to compare the proposed method with the current normal and nonparametric alternatives. The proposed models are also applied to a real dataset generated from assay validation studies.","inCitations":["8104b4c19f48101c1d06a60008c36126fae69bf9","14a8ca247695229fb1fe4c8cd24120b71c723a3b","6a8ecfe0f4d6926f23238ea4074cb2d9e563850d"],"title":"Non-normal random effects models for immunogenicity assay cut point determination.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.972515"}

Moreover, we show that the BAR estimator possesses a grouping effect: highly correlated covariates are naturally grouped together, which is a desirable property not known for other oracle variable selection methods. Lastly, we combine BAR with a sparsity-restricted least squares estimator and give conditions under which the resulting two-stage sparse regression method is selection and estimation consistent in addition to having the grouping property in high- or ultrahigh-dimensional settings.

However, given that an investigator will initially select a null treatment eﬀect and the clinically relevant diﬀerence, it is better to choose a design that also considers the expected sample size for each of these values. The maximum sample size and the two expected sample sizes are here combined to produce an expected loss function to ﬁnd designs that are admissible. Given the prior odds of success and the importance of the total sample size, minimising the expected loss gives the optimal design for this situation. A novel triangular graph to represent the admissible designs helps guide the decision-making process. The H₀-optimal, H₁-optimal, H₀-minimax and H₁-minimax designs are all particular cases of admissible designs. The commonly used H₀-optimal design is rarely good when allowing stopping for eﬃcacy. Additionally, the δ-minimax design, which minimises the maximum expected sample size, is sometimes admissible under the loss function.

The number of potential sources within the brain exceeds by an order of magnitude the number of recording sites. As a consequence, the estimates for the magnitude and location of the neural sources will be ill-conditioned because of the underdetermined nature of the problem. One well-known technique designed to address this imbalance is the minimum norm estimator (MNE). This approach imposes an L(2) regularization constraint that serves to stabilize and condition the source parameter estimates. However, these classes of regularizer are static in time and do not consider the temporal constraints inherent to the biophysics of the MEG experiment. In this paper we propose a dynamic state-space model that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations within and across candidate intra-cortical sources. In our model, the observation model is derived from the steady-state solution to Maxwell's equations while the latent model representing neural dynamics is given by a random walk process. We show that the Kalman filter (KF) and the Kalman smoother [also known as the fixed-interval smoother (FIS)] may be used to solve the ensuing high-dimensional state-estimation problem. Using a well-known relationship between Bayesian estimation and Kalman filtering, we show that the MNE estimates carry a significant zero bias. Calculating these high-dimensional state estimates is a computationally challenging task that requires High Performance Computing (HPC) resources. To this end, we employ the NSF Teragrid Supercomputing Network to compute the source estimates. We demonstrate improvement in performance of the state-space algorithm relative to MNE in analyses of simulated and actual somatosensory MEG experiments. Our findings establish the benefits of high-dimensional state-space modeling as an effective means to solve the MEG source localization problem.","inCitations":["6d88b0be57715e94320d367559057ae1218fd5ad","669c2fc19eb0218e1a174eaae63a5df5ea528f01","713056a31d6b0e5df7711737a2d7bd29bad4f856","4d03c7179836ac80dae76a0a29ad95eff4b6bc7f","bec0494d8f5e1b91b76d108d786863a65d55f7d4","b464f8d6b2070d48910d92011c8f416080e97350","852e27c1db9f6bfd394f49407256e7bf11002b65","ea93ec2e6128c686ba42f66b35ce36dd2a34172c","002c81fccd1626622d8440055a67ab7cd8a846f5","bb201b16f43d6139002ddc5894b1af31191f0c50","a0b1c466ae6c3f696147d314ad1a3fd6fa34d7f4","81dfbf837a6dacabbf00fde0a41b4551d0d7acee","b59bb2d657b86c1d57bca4a07b0afa847b2fe19c","1c4bd54bd591c9150673093b3b80088b8b07534b","76cfa874881f0de7cbc818776730415ef1e30737","b6760bcba3c11ff6774e9be16adfcbe6be312bdb","901db96edee6b728e627f43e645dc99c4d6ba74b","3c53b8e80044e5a73c2673161d57e90fd958ce56","98e35b72dd0e3e678d774ab273533bb8fa0aa159","0482f842afb3af58cd80871019aa28bdcb3c277e","3bb336060b10b408885f7ccafe52587b25bce829","647967c779132bdd1c86c1bb8436d34692dd832a","bf7a15925f764901bdb2a61bd1e0d345cf4dba01","a814cfbb1bafe9de6806e6025e6b8fe79f2838f5","0b3a5fdd0e23e7ac8f6f5668a65b2eca170358bb","9e59c9bc56f65d49f6ccb8a6cf3e964b919ea570","bc397302cc87b87e71dda373aa0e5866ed526004","34f0818b29bf5bdc680d6e1434d6b7791d43f3f0","2ee556e09bb16c8ae8cb96238d7711f45d02ce9a","6221ded6bb4acc16554801341c24c0de0a12b6c8","0fde41cf6fae88c946e56fc6ebeb3b84455c1fef","73c96aad0b482f0e89726e7baca27f323195cc44"],"title":"State-space Solutions to the Dynamic Magnetoencephalography Inverse Problem Using High Performance Computing.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS483"}

Global normalization methods are based on the assumption that observed variability in global properties is due to technical reasons and are unrelated to the biology of interest. For example, some methods correct for differences in sequencing read counts by scaling features to have similar median values across samples, but these fail to reduce other forms of unwanted technical variation. Methods such as quantile normalization transform the statistical distributions across samples to be the same and assume global differences in the distribution are induced by only technical variation. However, it remains unclear how to proceed with normalization if these assumptions are violated, for example, if there are global differences in the statistical distributions between biological conditions or groups, and external information, such as negative or control features, is not available. Here, we introduce a generalization of quantile normalization, referred to as smooth quantile normalization (qsmooth), which is based on the assumption that the statistical distribution of each sample should be the same (or have the same distributional shape) within biological groups or conditions, but allowing that they may differ between groups. We illustrate the advantages of our method on several high‐throughput datasets with global differences in distributions corresponding to different biological conditions. We also perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to illustrate the bias‐variance tradeoff and root mean squared error of qsmooth compared to other global normalization methods.

A typical approach is to use estimates from some pilot studies as the true parameters in the calculation. This approach, however, does not take into consideration sampling error. Thus, the resulting sample size could be misleading if the sampling error is substantial. As an alternative, we suggest a Bayesian approach with noninformative prior to reflect the uncertainty of the parameters induced by the sampling error. Based on the informative prior and data from pilot samples, the Bayesian estimators based on appropriate loss functions can be obtained. Then, the traditional sample size calculation procedure can be carried out using the Bayesian estimates instead of the frequentist estimates. The results indicate that the sample size obtained using the Bayesian approach differs from the traditional sample size obtained by a constant inflation factor, which is purely determined by the size of the pilot study. An example is given for illustration purposes.","inCitations":["ca9c3024a19c861aa5ccbe67ce81b1969369781b","3cbf631e288846dec8e0ac45d02e716536df97f0","ee56d1e3e3fb7a5ce477a109d286c5cb170dfe2d","03d3b0cf24678f0cd3c367536fedcd7a1b519b90","f3500385c4921a499f779b0a6466d9eb8834d25f","38fa40e7b144c586956483437bfb13265166767b","950c94dd578d090034f13ef75a717757a0b3946a","9b47e074ec7ecdc1312cae9cda9053b141bb56a9","fd142ff28d4c46c52055ce35357c3eb4fdc4ebba","d4adbe3dc97618bff9ee1009403345479f1d9c0c","75ac106b45eb6ae2906e378193f06f00319c7175","ef6b1dd31bf4a8b88944a4e115ef54e99d5887a7","c36377771cc167b81afad0cff579e57cf22311c0","5e55e7f7f050a8cf22ae4119ac9b153cf9c723e1"],"title":"A Bayesian approach on sample size calculation for comparing means.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200067789"}

In practice, the decision regarding whether to adopt a treatment-selection marker depends on the effect of using the marker on the rate of targeted disease and on the cost associated with treatment. We propose an expected benefit measure that incorporates both effects to quantify a marker's treatment-selection capacity. This measure builds upon an existing decision-theoretic framework, but is expanded to account for the fact that optimal treatment absent marker information varies with the cost of treatment. In addition, we establish upper and lower bounds on the expected benefit for a perfect treatment-selection rule which provides the basis for a standardized expected benefit measure. We develop model-based estimators for these measures in a randomized trial setting and evaluate their asymptotic properties. An adaptive bootstrap confidence interval is proposed for inference in the presence of non-regularity. Alternative estimators robust to risk model misspecification are also investigated. We illustrate our methods using the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial where we evaluate the expected benefit of baseline hemoglobin A1C in selecting diabetes treatment.","inCitations":["b40988e7ff0fb007409e80b81331403fbec5b145","2647ce29af022e30c7d7b54d2bd08ed0443385f3","5cdd187dfdcaef62c847256af7807495805bca05","5a4722972f1449a86ffe9fa4df345f0313236fd4","e5ac6c0f6859e9397132de17f7ae5f0b3154e417","4b2de5be0c7b918137c0c5935230555b5d08d9b5","cab32454fdfcf495d021f1d0b961e18cf31532cc","fdbfd529007e45480544dbbe2f4a8cfab1dd544f"],"title":"Characterizing expected benefits of biomarkers in treatment selection.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxu039"}

They are often designed as one-arm trials with response rate as the primary endpoint, and a two-stage design is often used to ensure early termination of the trial for futility. To control the type I error rate and guarantee the specified power of the study, planned sample sizes for both stages must be rigidly followed, but a literature review suggests that actual sample size often differs from that planned. We propose to extend simple two-stage designs to allow more flexible sampling plans in both stages. Our designs are preferable to similar extensions proposed to control type I and II error probabilities. Additionally, our assumptions regarding distribution of the actual sample size at the end of stage 1 are more lenient. A list of optimal designs for typical error rates and the selected null and alternative response rates is presented.","inCitations":["426a7d601ff43f6eac5e600e91651d07d6ea3326","4d887b0e6905d1f2bc8deea6ff0001c14f54998f","77562a29b0006afb923d18c82a345ec216150429","ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb","7819a131d2424201fcc51f67e00da5f3867012c6"],"title":"Optimal two-stage designs allowing flexibility in number of subjects for phase II clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400902964167"}

It is an important statistical problem to estimate parameters in ODEs from noisy observations. In this article we propose a method for estimating the time-varying coefficients in an ODE. Our method is a variation of the nonlinear least squares where penalized splines are used to model the functional parameters and the ODE solutions are approximated also using splines. We resort to the implicit function theorem to deal with the nonlinear least squares objective function that is only defined implicitly. The proposed penalized nonlinear least squares method is applied to estimate a HIV dynamic model from a real dataset. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new method can provide much more accurate estimates of functional parameters than the existing two-step local polynomial method which relies on estimation of the derivatives of the state function. Supplemental materials for the article are available online.","inCitations":["eebd4fc4e02b00401a279778c144ef43314d5f40","4f714516158a0ca73d5c86062546a737dc335510","f66cd70a8c970e0b846f8f7a350e5d31079e928a","7f06ac82d1da4be4cc9a46e572ccae0b30061e8f","95433d6ff8434ee8450d99b26769eaf971b5b1c2","a3b0ac072f7edd115af9025dc5eb36d7fd5ccedd","e1469ca8f311ae511b23ac5d686e87125097c75e","8af9ce30068ee81d1d5435b8c3958ab514917b2a","bfc34116454cff0454ea80097ed8b0a87b5b85ea","7b843942c877f0d3bc1c31c393438fc629814f9c","cb98d3e0c8bf66feff20d6eea0644d29f187dcec","9d4dfe16bdfd35c72e41a3809df2e984a0925076","b4c02b88cf7978b72589f2e9b8356e6460d46d3b","9ec993b11a435ec8faa739e9879facbcade4af49","d29bc3f5d5852fafff6f8d8d587412b20a03ea9c"],"title":"Penalized Nonlinear Least Squares Estimation of Time-Varying Parameters in Ordinary Differential Equations.","doi":"10.1198/jcgs.2011.10021"}

In practice, the constancy assumption is generally impossible to justify; often, there are clear reasons to expect a loss of efficacy over time. There are also concerns about the inherent and publication bias in the historical data, and various sources of selection bias in the NI trial design. Thus, a conservative NI margin is often considered. However, different NI margin approaches are largely evaluated under the assumption of constancy and absence of bias, and therefore, controversies arise and are unresolved on the necessary degree of conservativeness. We develop a framework to quantify the robustness of any NI margin approach against inherent and publication bias in historical data, selection bias in trial design, and nonconstancy in reference effects. We introduce a consistency principle to address variability in the historical data. We control across-trial conditional error rates given a final NI trial design over a design specific robust range for reference effects. Following a conditionality principle, we provide a theoretical justification of the framework and the conditions for controlling across-trial unconditional type 1 error rates. We raise the issue of inherent bias in historical data with an illustrative example.","inCitations":["a05a7ee67bb9ed547e9fce6f633340e7926f5361","a332295dd3a979dc3c83dd17cca5f0969feca5a7"],"title":"On robustness of noninferiority clinical trial designs against bias, variability, and nonconstancy.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.923738"}
