In particular, we study the type of dependence found in polynomial response surfaces of orders two and higher, whose model spaces are required to satisfy weak or strong heredity conditions. These conditions restrict the inclusion of higher-order terms depending upon the inclusion of lower-order parent terms. We develop classes of priors on the model space, investigate their theoretical and finite sample properties, and provide a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for searching the space of models. The tools proposed allow fast and thorough exploration of model spaces that account for hierarchical polynomial structure in the predictors and provide control of the inclusion of false positives in high posterior probability models.","inCitations":["61b497c567a27952d80b0e9e113663470e1adff9","bfacfe4375efc6df81877a6de589660b336244bd"],"title":"Bayesian Variable Selection on Model Spaces Constrained by Heredity Conditions.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2015.1056793"}

The spatial model is constructed through an application of reproducing kernels. A Bayesian framework is proposed to infer the unknown parameters. Simulations are performed to compare the reproducing kernel-based method with several commonly used approaches in spatial modeling, including independent Gaussian and CAR models. Compared with these models, the reproducing kernel-based method is easy to implement and more flexible in terms of the ability to model various spatial dependence patterns. To further demonstrate the proposed method, two real data applications are discussed: Scottish lip cancer data and Florida smoke-related cancer data.","inCitations":["296048f5e3053a2a10ccf277c601d67587664ce8","7caf336a00f812186ecca26c6d9cfd4921572c2e","feab23c8ad7194fbc7bcd52151f97d78ced3a728","bc2eea5e04e2192c42839a872879758561320deb","b82d7d8c17cb9ad74ed51600480fe37ae4abaa15"],"title":"A Reproducing Kernel-Based Spatial Model in Poisson Regressions","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1360"}

This family, labelled p*, generalizes the Markov random graphs of Frank and Strauss, which were further developed by them and others, building on Besag's ideas on estimation. These models were first used to model random variables embedded in lattices by Ising, and have been quite common in the study of spatial data. Here, they are applied to the statistical analysis of multigraphs, in general, and the analysis of multivariate social networks, in particular. In this paper, we show how to formulate models for multivariate social networks by considering a range of theoretical claims about social structure. We illustrate the models by developing structural models for several multivariate networks.","inCitations":["94d169fcc09fe2ce606efb2a6f294fc8a75faaca","6b8d2318d0bc531a0e71f25f0594feb13d620916","3d2bcf39cce9953d0e08d3fb3adb407fc0425867","c69f6567169bf2694f21bba78a5f0ea4993ef7f7","d6ee97b669192448d25d8a88aa37d8e024f0c2ec","7fe8d68ae9cb492c4048cccaf318f3ca15927215","c53bd44b9e1508d7f819fe37dffdf8e80b7e445a","7d017f227b3acb5c3a4a93e0bac6307102e39724","4d80d0b2758c0a7214416dd4af46499bac93f9be","a31101cc0b2d052d315bba9cf35104b6a7fa99d5","d5f2e5925e37bf544632c1909ea2c01a52542a1d","07d7581a4f305144a4154913b06e14050a44d077","b152102f2161b3036c3df4512309c47ee1cf1e0a","428001843dd8d001cafee4fcb4310e17baf89f62","c02408ad95bc3fe9684b5682a426aa011cfc0ba2","1ef76843f6bf42a24e3b1fe7e87510282bf433b9","a5596ab0084bfc5af6be98f407d37de35b6440ef","1f3b4e47f27a0e79fa47a796dd67d192619eaea7","292f12bc90999951de8846eb5cd13434e2cf90a4","7f482e1086a8bc0820b5c66468f9cc8dd7d18d49","574b8f9a462d1d10f3c1ee0b8140c20497c94c3f","c5b8c3ec8dc9198cd2ca49fe2218c4d93ebb7dde","b7f9f6a6275c8de78be16250697b7bfef383ee54","0b6d7466c0cc00b461749d68816bb34b1535fde7","2c93d861dc0c1ab3d753c94826a9b68a20c768e3","df622aace31b0a2f58b0cb26c1eef4abd672d920","064f6394a5100b8952b5ca9dabf0d0db7edc7840","4f4bbe2a7a63b1d41454642ed39b645e46c350a7","0a91895d969759715505d22e78ac697d98b36b98","d5e1741467b8b67ebf0e17677b845d9999b8e4be","af9a29bbde58c5b02d019d1f818203e67f059c64","c2ca78a809b44455807198ac9064d7b794cbda56","9aecff9b953fcd4cce23101f5e4ecc99a07beed8","fa1f835c806e63f891d4e926169bf5d9056eced1","573217bdfaa7b4b9749bb0c7e5138e7730980b94","fc32a4658e09b880123c84a9ad632e1a0173b17d","e8de9db7366214630a68ca09b93ae0b77467d773","bab5c537bdef6b5c5b8e82213abc5650fc2ecd03","4483f5f99d81fb06dc0c9e67a8b2c49bd444c791","87a1dc78f87a90696be212b5d2370ca139293705","404c8da88ad1c50c05ce8b3bfef0fa5bd7f6c366","a362ae12d445a7a8a0ce383ad92dfd6aa04d3c2c","b2f2f0d1213762e4fe74754ddc405730dd86c0f2","95a5b702c1a1532a853bc194e6ae705480db6696","dd2719bb1c457f26c5764152068c7eb585c7293d","78070d97d68f1bfe63df08a061c1c7f3d4a2c87e","f2f3c77b52842cf856879871cb2f23d9eb1f3e2c","db05bce6bf68d6b61f008150667bcaf1a514e64a","a487dd0a897ac6d1ade26a46453bbbb5bebb55ef","faac251478425e172442c6e2212cef46ae9ef4c6","27a996dcfc5c74285c9af0b227a080917b4a7372","1d272c4d3b34c725ced83d082df48f638112c2e3","d93702a838823e9b0d5a82bf9bf7e6af233d267c","243bec0423d9a4ff5fa8fb67dd2171b319846749","44610e7afca5d86f48039434cef6bebf26e00a97","d64e296572c0dfc21abd2fb739c855960f9f3ec1","ff5b5bdb0910485a74ec769db5ee1ddb49c76ff8","f089133fb2fd4d246bae5e9aa06fda6d83955523","4deff33f7c8ecbc531d8191f08eb1f0fd3506919","feef02c8ba2ec425afa9fb17eab3de021f78191a","a2fa43a7c442de160572fa02cdbf2cd768d47cb8","cc6ee2bdbd76146e2cfed95e914b8a6fd1abd5d7","7296538512239d393eb997edc46bc0b3ca9bd8e1","e1c958228c5afa8f3a442380f302714577e28767","aa4401667b6e13c6c1be436d8ee9524e808e98d7","425a06c8def90c941bc1cda217f69f296c8463cb","918dea714431b5ccf607f080b7d3487569f1ee6f","8e34952923fef3181bf30903e14fc7e1904dfc2e","06655626e5071a6163f67f2551d8e630ce50909a","45ef4a94ea7c41544bb9bf0dc4916124d0365949","b9b2b9e4e91953b088f2c22fc52e1dda6e877b00","e125e3deb98a5c4d53d0fe2668dbf951a0430953","6be266c8cb3e93edbf5e737d1661e4e8d7aca63e","0a9567878d8561f4a4e103ed21668d791cf9f57d","2577383ebd371b6eff64c03cdb397c1b054a9049","19953041ef34ed53dc33e760ed4b0bdd31218e5c","8de14c6183fa2b6d16f16bfb77740fc55db5ca5a","b5bb11cec5a6d1e5562c58f5bca1989b20142b26","fbbc7e4bfd95b295d33893e648e8dafef46c37a9","83f709d193a92abff8d498082fd7fee14a036317","28775f27e6d7997ffedc857d419e8635280846b8","c7c09c5d3b84edfdc77776a43bcee1d1c735ef59","08690957768fc3c5d5c96177d821f514afd3f06d","8b58ed6d32a8ee954b015051957a8f6b3fe66457","6d70d6e587983ad1e6a00b4db4ee0749af2df29a","cb5a1eb7d223f888382c9618cea4cdacaf9f04c2","a4ec0c0867a610979fc8bea67f575b9363e0c749","c456d6fcae34624c17b81ad92d927918ba8809d1","25136c9f58bffb17c29b0aa6ad271feb009149cb","3acc94ce8f4e0ca277f67871698e48bf0bbabdc9","b57f9eaeb4dd6297a82f6ee2653a7013c7d15c29","41c5c4726995cc14b66f5445c72a78dd883bc9dc","0f95e6bb304b9fb80fe36b14864e9fbadf8be1ad","99e3ee165fa2f4a51c75370f22002bf85a850d5e","ddc66a4481188bb21f458ac88bad3ebb02ea55f9","24d1ba235cdc54b44160adb00dad85198138882d","d88e45e777c7676af4e7f47bc995ecccbef6917e","6b69ff23012c4bb82aed1c8784f2102745b13619","5be5b458585b488f8f7a51110d92d31f42d21374","4374652f0a1d61ad3b39df499072f403f7923bae","b5ba0a86e3c702ba4d2b2f5f8ff7e9fbe65eca10","be0b02a47f5bb32b778405aa61d21f2e1514ceb5","d67184ca9ab51c69d36af166a93258b427c6cb56","000abae9bfe85dc0b6a58046d41c6c5838cc1a97","c7fb2838c8fb11343e02e9c86ccaf8d562997f56","858fea112dcd8d673dea4472313174d5c196508b","96390ecc1d80d77470936380319c263653888fe0","3a9eaf69a36f16aa943af9220ee51ee26a381681","5f945562c3bd23c71730b3cf1d913961947153fe","2f04e34f8aa7abe2b02127afd4a484a740d7d594","d81ce4f6495250024da05129dc72f59c0dcdb0bd","10af93c0c36ee5c132ebd3fff8ed1cb36b4ab501","613735c75d6f2cb12e1a4a7739f17f3c88eff72b","9bfb6395f3d27fac22f0093bd854c68fb68bc84e","070929ac12dc5a593645beada1e239cf674d5b80","c1260a7f0af8b6f1e618ed0afe72

The framework allows mixed-scale measurements associated with each time series, with different measurements having different distributions in the exponential family conditionally on time-varying latent factor(s). Efficient Bayesian computational algorithms are developed for posterior inference on both the latent factors and model parameters, based on a Metropolis Hastings algorithm with adaptive proposals. The algorithm relies on a Greedy Density Kernel Approximation (GDKA) and parameter expansion with latent factor normalization. We tested the framework and algorithms in simulated studies and applied them to the analysis of intertwined credit and recovery risk for Moody's rated firms from 1982-2008, illustrating the importance of jointly modeling mixed-measurement time series.

Our method allows for the estimation of a wide variety of effects, including potentially smooth and smoothly time‐varying effects as well as cumulative effects with leads and lags, taking advantage of the inference methods that have recently been developed for generalized additive mixed models. We apply our method to data from a large observational study of intensive care patients in order to analyze the association of both the timing and the amount of artificial nutrition with the short term survival of critically ill patients. We evaluate the properties of the proposed method by performing extensive simulation studies and provide a systematic comparison with related approaches.","inCitations":["559061b1cfd567b3a2c7eaab8b00b7cc0cd9fd19","03e1f9e691c9f0a28c92e8a2f9e83a3588fdbb8a"],"title":"Penalized estimation of complex, non‐linear exposure‐lag‐response associations","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy003"}

It has been proposed to model RNA-seq counts as continuous variables using nonparametric regression to account for their inherent heteroscedasticity. In this vein, we propose tcgsaseq, a principled, model-free, and efficient method for detecting longitudinal changes in RNA-seq gene sets defined a priori. The method identifies those gene sets whose expression varies over time, based on an original variance component score test accounting for both covariates and heteroscedasticity without assuming any specific parametric distribution for the (transformed) counts. We demonstrate that despite the presence of a nonparametric component, our test statistic has a simple form and limiting distribution, and both may be computed quickly. A permutation version of the test is additionally proposed for very small sample sizes. Applied to both simulated data and two real datasets, tcgsaseq is shown to exhibit very good statistical properties, with an increase in stability and power when compared to state-of-the-art methods ROAST (rotation gene set testing), edgeR, and DESeq2, which can fail to control the type I error under certain realistic settings. We have made the method available for the community in the R package tcgsaseq.","inCitations":["f9cf843628ede2d0a104388ce0f523e6da7f2b57","d991a865f00a1357f1a487001c1431d7a49bc33c"],"title":"Variance component score test for time-course gene set analysis of longitudinal RNA-seq data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx005"}

Assuming independent right-censoring and proportional hazards for the two treatment groups, we considered event-driven designs with fixed number of events, which guarantees the power to be at a desired level under a certain alternative. We develop reestimation procedures based on parametric models and show that these maintain the expected duration of the trial at a target length in flexible follow-up designs across a range of nuisance parameter values by adjusting the number of patients recruited into the trial based on blinded nuisance parameter estimates. Furthermore, we provide convincing evidence from a simulation study that such procedures proposed do not inflate the type I error rate in any practically relevant way, thereby satisfying the standards set by relevant international guidelines. Inspired by practical application of these procedures, we outline a number of extensions including methods for extrapolating the observed survival curve beyond the interim time point, application of reestimation procedures to interval censored data, and situations in which a confirmation of event is required leading to a certain lag time.\n","inCitations":["ec521d8820457eed073e77aeed523b5860baf02d"],"title":"Blinded sample size reestimation in event-driven clinical trials: Methods and an application in multiple sclerosis.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1927"}

Transition probabilities depend on two covariates, age and the presence/absence of an apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 allele, through a multinomial logistic model with shared random effects.

Therefore, cost saving 2-stage designs were proposed in the literature. The restriction to 2 stages, however, seems artificial and does not exploit the full potential of the underlying methods. We extend the 2-stage approach to the general framework of any number of stages. Based on the theory of group sequential methods, we derive optimal multistage designs. With current genotyping cost structures, our results suggest that up to 4 stages are sufficient in order to get feasible and efficient designs. Furthermore, we consider the problem of choosing the optimal number of stages depending on the costs of the statistical interim analysis at each stage and provide guidelines for planning the number of stages in practice. In particular, we found that in the majority of cases both 3-stage designs and 4-stage designs are more efficient than 2-stage designs. Although prices for marker panels are showing a continuing downward trend, we still recommend implementing and using optimal multistage designs in practice. In addition to the immediate benefit, it will be necessary to acquire know-how regarding the application of multistage designs in order to be able to adapt the general framework of multistage designs to upcoming technologies in the area of GWAS.","inCitations":["5f3e7df26d6fde0dc0a17030548005b2d776d302","c0ee1d691c2495a78f9dcad2652e6fa332f6ec2e","60a2d827591de69258a47fc7849bd8d60f20eb17","5677b1e74fcae133d67dfbfdd1dcda66d223f903","b94b1e246eb39ff001d76e8ade073c37884937e3","c97892aa6dbc69bfd4fb81c0948a957e866e5fa3","5736fcb553fc6edf89f79c61505cd6fe7f2b28d6","fa7dc2ffd04b7ab68960736bd1e81399bd1413c3","b76ecf57c95524129701e19133c389711e46b77e","e06624b2340947eb1d51d1bfd77e0387c4724a51","161ec99aa6a09fcde5033eefdfd9d65660670731","ca301418460c62aaf50f83bf61e1e2bf08bda21e","2d89f3b2022cf3db41013d4d6050a32721626754"],"title":"Optimal multistage designs--a general framework for efficient genome-wide association studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn036"}

However, failing to account for other dependencies can lead to inefficient estimates of regression parameters, inaccurate standard errors and poor predictions. An alternative to assuming independent errors is to allow for dependence along each dimension of the array using a separable covariance model. However, the number of parameters in this model increases rapidly with the dimensions of the array and, for many arrays, maximum likelihood estimates of the covariance parameters do not exist. In this paper, we propose a submodel of the separable covariance model that estimates the covariance matrix for each dimension as having factor analytic structure. This model can be viewed as an extension of factor analysis to array-valued data, as it uses a factor model to estimate the covariance along each dimension of the array. We discuss properties of this model as they relate to ordinary factor analysis, describe maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation methods, and provide a likelihood ratio testing procedure for selecting the factor model ranks. We apply this methodology to the analysis of data from the Human Mortality Database, and show in a cross-validation experiment how it outperforms simpler methods. Additionally, we use this model to impute mortality rates for countries that have no mortality data for several years. Unlike other approaches, our methodology is able to estimate similarities between the mortality rates of countries, time periods and sexes, and use this information to assist with the imputations.","inCitations":["fd4b2dd68119af57a829fa89693b45163074c869","1c01dc5dc7e61adc28812d4d1ad0225d3439ca1b","a0dec74684107ae9d53c5dab3dfcdae3280bc4ca","bfcedf88ee2c57fd68ceca82d18dec7088667777","f59561c65c03d2751a949c94329a1e4207c2d7a2","1f0ec975b22d7664aa3165e0a83140f292f05e41","aab04f8e303505557812994f56424b5ccc30cd74","37da0b13cacabe4ba03847213ae3620d21af8bac","f59a08be36c8ed859fc419824cb51065d549189a","11e60a852b2cd1385c63c8143ced2113d67f5ab8","d10bdcc9b16110915de05e8db9aa84195c6cd61a","6ab2edc95ae9afc8a3515b8c8ef52aa3296b9c72","3b6923c75fb55c6ebe118fe664f827747c77dd4d","04b27552daa66ed79005fd67d2a64e4b22295774","fa0932ce56408479a98b4c46f8e5cdff2ae338bb","dc970ea3d81f8b511c5cc315108fbafd936baa0e","2bccb3e85ce49104a85f2e7c6cf30999e260fc46","7d77549074451b0f56e0e31a386039933f60551d"],"title":"Separable Factor Analysis with Applications to Mortality Data.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS694"}

This problem affects many disease areas, since it stems from how randomized trials, often the gold standard for evaluating treatments, are designed and analyzed. Our goal is to learn about the fraction who benefit from a new treatment using randomized trial data. We consider the case where the outcome is ordinal, with binary outcomes as a special case. In general, the fraction who benefit is non-identifiable, and the best that can be obtained are sharp lower and upper bounds. Our contributions include (i) proving the plug-in estimator of the bounds can be inconsistent if support restrictions are made on the joint distribution of the potential outcomes; (ii) developing the first consistent estimator for this case; and (iii) applying this estimator to a randomized trial of a medical treatment to determine whether the estimates can be informative. Our estimator is computed using linear programming, allowing fast implementation.

A typical GWAS may genotype hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located throughout the human genome in a set of cases and controls. Logistic regression is often used to test for association between a SNP genotype and case versus control status, with corresponding odds ratios (ORs) typically reported only for those SNPs meeting selection criteria. However, when these estimates are based on the original data used to detect the variant, the results are affected by a selection bias sometimes referred to the \"winner's curse\" (Capen and others, 1971). The actual genetic association is typically overestimated. We show that such selection bias may be severe in the sense that the conditional expectation of the standard OR estimator may be quite far away from the underlying parameter. Also standard confidence intervals (CIs) may have far from the desired coverage rate for the selected ORs. We propose and evaluate 3 bias-reduced estimators, and also corresponding weighted estimators that combine corrected and uncorrected estimators, to reduce selection bias. Their corresponding CIs are also proposed. We study the performance of these estimators using simulated data sets and show that they reduce the bias and give CI coverage close to the desired level under various scenarios, even for associations having only small statistical power.","inCitations":["98a01629312f3837f92e079ef39ba39ebe31176e","421d5450ddd044cb53171eb69b3877a9896290ee","403a81f6a79af03d1bf7ca6161ff4de94627ea9e","2b17ea86584cb81b4f962b716681c9faa3b48633","8e63c374719fae367c568fc829f533ae90d47052","b7d8b22dba3e29af843a65205342f1f4e7e2482c","69d46479bda774969055f732dfda9b333bc45eda","60bc813c5b7cea9ae0c586c1740993eb2acd51ca","833344706de253ab5b14850fbae47d65cd5ac824","c0fe242e50f949a66c6f7f0fbc63e8f17eb112eb","7e8b9a9b5922e5f948f2e4c935afd19779c804e3","a0cab0fbdece28840ef1dac9ca03955eeb33a53e","8600835e3ae5c973d88e17fdddda492d899ad71b","88c9a9721f63f32ac926e458d241c9f3bf389012","ca7f612d80ca3f9d1946c3773ec0db7f9a15ff47","ea4932285613db760230aedc971df152c13f5970","c9111c290f473d193447dbc21f8d77fa2c93106a","32bda60b2c9f5df0f0c60ce9f39d7decd84aecf8","06d75bfbb5a087a394671aa9e0c65b2341fb6b95","1a59ba0a750a650d164840caa9e7adc47f50f3e2","a2e555b1664a144d2db27ebbb542ae377e5a11a9","3c32b58d45f761a1f6e81dad3c9605a8135a1ff4","26ec8099c3685ed537a5de1c8dbcad867e4b6349","8e5ca2bfe69cf6fe1b24bd7ee6520de53fe9d7b0","d612d80aefeab03f2cb981a730b5780ac7957d45","cce2521b2f924329251baebfd9329aecda032080","b545e3af5f960cefcad5f50210fba02725d28594","e603409ab7d3f7497412e5e3887c82c7adc7d442","8b79658f49b42eb04230992d901dacbf983f2b68","054a2d121e608bd7c6d06e8e757c8ac59cbe2812","aef3c152de9a15490cd4c7e0c68ed7d802149985","08717ca7cb865fc579f104b40c8394d35b48f143","3375b37d9e8c02227103af8834b673812503ccff","953ee4f3f368a085f3dfdf03fd2a36465d829e86","256aa150faf36d487edb31a8a767b1b96efd6101","8e778bc1f5c1c2a754b966acfa345a69eee9c556","888e7c948ca6c726be2ba459b1587ce28dfea4da","41a94915485eb7c267705420d509a71ee08a9a91","0b3b03e120182288a42c984170f0c40b302211fd","8ba59c1be4588d7d3f27fe2020d724c4989ca21d","e540a690c65608930f03724dfdd522140cea66b4","ed3ed8e3cba2be286f13ab9e594949e5c3f3512c","201e5a6c55edb4685bbe6e1917628726d89211c8","f6c9ce9ee1f1f9341f662b5d9da7881946dc5b29","fd4f7d57805028315ca1dfbd791336cda5fa1745","4955fe88942dbd3ea49e4f5164ae93bb7e8724fb","8e35f1bce2279e3d16e6b0af047c5a119b6903bd","1645ac0adf3365ad68a7a9306caa4111516b16f8","45e37487d28abefcba5166524464ab938079af4a","2c6c8777baf038793efdd0eb55086e18fbac5ba3","7b760f8390e505fc3261f9130b4f73f656b7409e","4f66bf775803007d8795b4bdddcb2edc6c921880","8a39c5c05623581b220baf13208683cc38d63973","834938c6119bb75dfbb16e76c387db1329e06663","80c3123f9870b6010998764714a80604c6df410c","426f426da9126213a0115e591a8faf8db8bb0c97","c1789b9754b40b4b5c513f9c0dca4215d7d5b170","48e6b5425b971516b8f1aed840f0dababd9f3b21","c0ee5868666aba8e69a574d1743f6999199e031f","0d0d8eed1362f79992b5fa066ce5edb414f824f8","6f6e78e2fe3d9aa1367206a85444bccca662927e","02e0002081f9bdbca8585e3c0b981914da2f0744","33bc446f881d99643e4f2feaf7104e83f0ae5c4b","145ffc8e54db3d99ca9b40ce686e30894cc1201d","47935fa838794f4ff0f26a00be1bd79d81418ce5","c1edc07f43e75ac6664e3b9da17ff980c135b495","7dad228cb8fff5739f29b0ef392938fc6fdb0b2c","7e5f43a9914ad2f36ff882071a25de0e5ab5d559","600d99d9959578a81d611678964b7a4f8cb75730","4ff50b1be2516d31efe3161f9793ebc1fcb09ff2","e19137182efb9d5839e59b2b6c3fa9de35a62e13","abe4ac84b22fbfab7c659e7b0abee07a1a4e6a73","f34ca98ab2b46521ac3b7292a3c0c81f89a63766","dd63a63ef76d23c898f122f0f757ac307b836c19","0cdba29e707c14a7808f115bc18f1a594c383163","01088205c5c132caebac90bc0fd20053c6fd9fa5","f093ff8006f6b41c9d90f6a5eda87c83403462b7","388b57e58d69b67fcc47b771b2ff7c00ccd28bd4","b0f25a2af21a48e3597314fd162f8f2c268df4f7","77f4cff9baa9c9d5580cae3957ccd2e2a1697199","6657e9922a29019a99de93407c8fa7b63418a13c","dbc83fbe6a1832e3a93a869c9aa1cad5340c4d6f","a18502ed4adb51b0c994efb0780cd7cd9962065c","21ea42b52c0584f528cd74b7d5e1812b03846101","21610506e9a00ea547c7daa8146c29e60efd5f9b","5e3ccba90639df7b9fd64cce8c9d2f7f0a4d7b2f","694155e80fdbdfe49dfc816a2d40d3d35c05cb92","0a7500b368c7b55a99136c63675a54db3de4e9be","25c35bb7f4fcd3e0d7fc8eb3098d082da17d6a56","825faf875f5a1a7fd206742571e74e3f93a5b99b","77f465d750dd8a2daff58cff7a8513cece62590d","7946233408e8a1c38980b757470fba7954d50662","852d7acb2eaff7be98fe5d6a2989f4bf02983a29","91424d1e7bf928dc4ebb3085163f4bf5d2fff5eb","2fa555ae3710754bb206da5b62c3becacab972b0","7f99101f9193f60244c4517b716ff3bee3f47995","bebc15bfc189dcec4d19cd183288257414cd585b","05cc1e85897f53258ea19163dabd84933b190401","f51839286412f375861ba56bb03bc38587c9e7bb"],"title":"Bias-reduced estimators and confidence intervals for odds ratios in genome-wide association studies.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn001"}

This article presents five simultaneous confidence intervals and two bootstrap simultaneous confidence intervals for risk differences in stratified matched-pair designs. The proposed confidence intervals are evaluated with respect to their coverage probabilities, expected widths, and ratios of the mesial noncoverage to noncoverage probability. Empirical results show that (1) hybrid simultaneous confidence intervals outperform nonhybrid simultaneous confidence intervals; (2) hybrid simultaneous confidence intervals based on median estimator outperform those based on maximum likelihood estimator; and (3) hybrid simultaneous confidence intervals incorporated with Wilson score and Agresti coull intervals and the bootstrap t-percentile simultaneous interval based on median unbiased estimators behave satisfactorily for small to large sample sizes in the sense that their empirical coverage probabilities are close to the prespecified nominal confidence level, and their ratios of the mesial noncoverage to noncoverage probabilities lie in [0.4,0.6] and are hence recommended.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2017,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aim at providing reliable estimates of treatment benefit. Missing data and nonadherence to treatment are distinct problems that can substantially impede this task. In practice, the fact that the handling of missing data due to nonadherence affects the question that is addressed is often ignored. Estimands allow precisely predefining the question of interest. Estimands are definitions of that which is being estimated with regard to population, endpoint, and handling of postrandomization events (eg, nonadherence). Depending on the situation, different estimands are of relevance. Therefore, it is important that the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, which is considered the gold standard for analyzing RCTs, does not restrict an RCT's primary objective to only one of several relevant estimands. Although much ambiguity is involved around what is considered to constitute the ITT principle, many associate ITT with completely following up all patients and including all data of all randomized patients as allocated into the analysis. This would restrict primary objectives to estimating the effect of treatment policy and is certainly not warranted in all situations. To maintain the advantage of having the clear recommendation to follow the ITT principle while allowing for various relevant estimands as primary objective, we argue that the appropriate way forward is to define ITT as including all randomized patients into the analysis set and each patient is to be allocated to his or her randomized treatment. This definition comprises the actual intent of ITT and can be fully implemented also in settings where complete follow-up is impossible.","inCitations":["f82273c8d234dcc9ff0e8b50beda879558ef199b","b47187e3e4754bc90a6d7f2047fe1fd83c79db62","7196152042d2490a6765214c521f884538b9f7dd","20495f80e64915724a2c2b7c2aabcc1b165728d6","10b18a114fa561b571601f822926585f24307a4e"],"title":"Disentangling estimands and the intention-to-treat principle.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1791"}

We first specify a model for the relationship status of a single dyad and then extend it to account for important inter-dyad dependencies (e.g., transitivity - \"a friend of a friend is a friend\") and heterogeneity. Model parameters are estimated using Bayesian analysis implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo. We use the model to perform novel analyses of two diverse longitudinal friendship networks: an excerpt of the Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study (a moderately sized network) and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (a large network).","inCitations":["ac34c23a4c5f6c82cf53d727881ada3059e14d81","f0c50dc01052dbb02b0ed29e512f09e7c8447723","e29eff588832d803221c8e5b0d18e028ca1bb326","77fdf21c92d76779bd451e2b624ab32cd7feba5f","61ede53272f795e1115badd45f28164e34b98a37","dae2debc0c663baaea86c1371b335e45695da5ff"],"title":"Hierarchical longitudinal models of relationships in social networks.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12013"}
