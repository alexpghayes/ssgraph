Under a subset of the assumptions required for penalized estimation approaches to recover the graph, this edge screening approach has the sure screening property: with high probability, the screened edge set is a superset of the true edge set. Furthermore, the screened edge set is relatively small. We illustrate the performance of this new edge screening approach in simulation studies.","inCitations":["342b3a9b8c974bb7aeb9f113ee2a2492a2cac641","429d8e91e7d1c96ad7e6eb238516506386b21541","f8ba1e7b9b70dbdbf68d28809c6ae5ee099c56d6","11577e02424df70b0542a67cde73057a9ca253da","52de25db71f2351be6d8b26c2a8c228d5ae4449c"],"title":"Nearly assumptionless screening for the mutually-exciting multivariate Hawkes process.","doi":"10.1214/17-EJS1251"}

In previous work, a measure of spatial heterogeneity based on evaluating the deviation of the FDG utilization distribution within the tumor region from a unimodal elliptically contoured spatial pattern was developed. This measure was shown to be a strong prognostic indicator of time to death. The present work explores a more general measure of heterogeneity which incorporates tumor boundary information. The approach relies on the use of a non-parametric representation for the tumor boundary surface. A set of 179 sarcoma patients with follow-up are evaluated with this technique. The results are analyzed to obtain empirical insight into the factors explaining elliptical heterogeneity. In terms of patient survival, the incorporation of the more sophisticated measure of spatial heterogeneity shows some potential improvement in the prediction risk. Further data will enable us to obtain a clearer empirical understanding of the role of the surface information in the measurement of tumor heterogeneity.","inCitations":["ddc8fd4403f7043d78a1612eb5e6906e5f74dd30","c95732473e6a52bd4e635d9b12f0cb6835668baa","525baef4cc5428f35f553ab84328894d7cd78c0a","6211aa072ce451fbf98c0108c789c3a3fa0314a5","0c306bcf4364331178c5dcc859806574399f28dd","6cc07c2fe96274732f486cc28378d2c7a2fc2446","da102053a72cae845d2e35265a5a2dde37c8fa03","934a2055975c7953d3587acd2d91827660d8a180","d03a6777b22ee00e83ab3ce5c0c3c59872a918ce","45d9c3082c602f539f327afd0362f085ce5a372a","7c49fc3511e25dadb1f20f5e4ad533a48a2ff608","dc36f813de6a3d6b6e64b1a97cfa86d362c78597","94838905bf36c59ba0740d748d7341734ccec99b","10f84af2606aaac3e99f911b871d5b5aff1a4305","5a95b65cd1d387323db643de6f60fb34aec4210f","02284ea3355375bd373ee376a9be51b4800344bd","f3e885145fffd125e95bd0de5d6d9c5335f5f0ee","9afad37b7f2a4ce9b70aaefd53ead8d895fd1534","450ba54b3127cc6cac3db52767c438d710f4649a","6a2103adb2175b4ea32830d567dd8d16728cc8b9","55c05d32f3fb8b15243cfc43b834a63678d937a9","73c5ac2e88c43707da0314dcbd496429ecf6114a","cd7008ca6689f589771aae7be8e527223622cda4","a4f2ba626fc000e811d1446d7d36f625c4b2d1ee","600d1c72fa5d25f93a70406b24fd46e1248341e2","83382642e24763031d59afec6ca395673ed85d72","a7da5e01fb8b07e7f49901ad6bc5006bdac75fd9","4c41cfd730a82f57148a3192fc6842b7bcf379d5","153a8f73f8554f86a131951e596098d57484a45b","de6da3db392fd8b36d3e44e5ff2b38a0a892e6e2","e9ca1f4c65f6e1be4f4726940ef27a8d56cfc1dd","148e29dc03f4bdb31e803508aa9cda5900d5d3a7","c0198a0364a63ff6360b1b5ffe0de3338c1506d8","55039c5aaba2072d9a01da9b1ea06ad8b4f06cb5","5daffd6008ce2a6738256bb349bcc65208b689a4","1274bee9dcf7db321004939c3dcb571824738180","1aa4ace7d7592501852bccb16b4593bf130dc644","81fbb830dd7160137850d14860630470111fc708","d61114e7d88a2f21725ccf417fcbb0eaa81bb305","9da686a4d8c12efe3fca727e1e74921108142ba8"],"title":"Incorporation of tumor shape into an assessment of spatial heterogeneity for human sarcomas imaged with FDG-PET.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxi010"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2015,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"Cluster bias refers to measurement bias with respect to the clustering variable in multilevel data. The absence of cluster bias implies absence of bias with respect to any cluster-level (level 2) variable. The variables that possibly cause the bias do not have to be measured to test for cluster bias. Therefore, the test for cluster bias serves as a global test of measurement bias with respect to any level 2 variable. However, the validity of the global test depends on the Type I and Type II error rates of the test. We compare the performance of the test for cluster bias with the restricted factor analysis (RFA) test, which can be used if the variable that leads to measurement bias is measured. It appeared that the RFA test has considerably more power than the test for cluster bias. However, the false positive rates of the test for cluster bias were generally around the expected values, while the RFA test showed unacceptably high false positive rates in some conditions. We conclude that if no significant cluster bias is found, still significant bias with respect to a level 2 violator can be detected with an RFA model. Although the test for cluster bias is less powerful, an advantage of the test is that the cause of the bias does not need to be measured, or even known.","inCitations":["e4a738e1361f5f30803fb637ee2f8feabfdb7739","566783aab1e360aa009854f66f2f1964ae3f2206","44c07cb887d2c31a187bbb811f4d8afb85e887da"],"title":"On the power of the test for cluster bias.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12053"}

Data on outbreak size in a sample of households from one epidemic are used to derive maximum likelihood estimates and confidence bounds for parameters of a stochastic model for disease transmission in a community of households. These parameter estimates induce estimates and confidence bounds for the basic reproduction number and the critical immunity coverage, which are the parameters of main interest when aiming at preventing major outbreaks in the future. The case when individuals are homogeneous, apart from the size of their household, is considered in detail. The generalization to the case with variable infectivity, susceptibility and/or mixing behaviour is discussed more briefly. The methods are illustrated with an application to data on influenza in Tecumseh, Michigan.","inCitations":["6d3a152b0d6066f6575684cce29eab1a7ed84b5a","e6e5a33f66047b9d1cc01c20b5af33220a203849","59e87fd85d84f11d2e3db3445abbf862f6ca7d23","e0aa2518c5f7834c3eacef71dd3936cc471a23b6","d4c5083030f60f6e49b13d6c295fc4b8ab16fae4","e662711a613b35c6e6119e9236a9758b94bc8b53","9cf3435583c8e02042c12e5e6701dc65c68d7711","7d309c18458fcb639df72d02f92c613153271ef2","8fe955fe2782ce295832be27744db62470bd13d1","2a3b723946b6cc33d9520f673663786210454f6c","2309fc430b90b54ea60f785d9d31850f92919f11","bf6bd0e74c4c81f5ce198748c9bb63fa65a3f3a1","64f6bc53717b3c6841aebc1591b8b9de52140f1b","8bd2070171b4a277a73d52c047d76472eb90dc6f","d553c67e174f2b7cc5072c32e9257ab897c5601c","c4dd3fcd71997703fb3d3386b93c2f9a1d1feb96","69d4a5f751f23d41cfb3a024967b1c940e30c2aa"],"title":"Estimating the immunity coverage required to prevent epidemics in a community of households.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.389"}

The context is that of dose-finding designs where certain design parameters are fixed by the investigator. Although our focus is on the CRM (O'Quigley et al., 1990), the essential ideas can be applied to any sequential dose-finding method. It is expected that different choices of a model family and particular parameterizations will have an impact on performance. Assuming that the constraints outlined in Shen and O'Quigley (1996) are respected, large sample performance is unaffected. However small sample performance will be affected by these choices, which are to some degree arbitrary. This work focuses on the retrospective robustness of the CRM in practice. The question is not of a general theoretical nature where, in the background, we would want to consider large numbers of true potential situations. Instead, the question is raised in the specific context of any actual completed study and is the following: Would we have come to the same conclusion concerning the MTD had we worked with a design specified differently? The sequential nature of the CRM means that this question cannot be answered in any definitive way. We can, though, by appealing to the retrospective CRM (O'Quigley, 2005), provide consistent estimates of the relationships between the MTD and the chosen model. If these estimates suggest that changes in different family model parameters will be accompanied by changes in final recommendation, then we would not be confident in the reliability of the estimated MTD and more work would be needed. Also, of course, at the planning stage, prospective robustness could be studied by simulating trials using particular models and parameterizations.","inCitations":["3c466c8e7a2af1986c50350e82b2a8ff671dc2c8","b026bd9069f7ebf447b215a46096196607b040a0","b9492ded704ca0314b172b5e2c94f300f3ed9e0c","e552ff58b72bc7d245ee84b0ea3cdd6270d359ca","30fd9b11b8e66967c17df888a959b89d6aa0840d","0004e473057a840417e31f34721459385d486af3","18b1e1048967b301c18de3734acb99169f1195e5","9998275e0a284839fe3ead2241adf9781f5ac8eb","3405ed8888004195de5d9fc67ef92974ad7321b5","b9efb2e7dd1dfe51c8007488594b29dedbae11b4","0972eec3009d20a9b203fb92aba2e72d890c6519","8ffc93523d8e915d7543c68eeca77a8a8b72ead8","9802c1d9ef1869a6a5f27ff20530a9f7ab87a08b","9c015c269e6a0648a68a5857e4a3cbc8fd7a562f","6e18da4c858df79d77ac69384104a8b3b94b30c5","8f68ff6d37c52217d9a1158442bf0526ec198c2e"],"title":"Retrospective robustness of the continual reassessment method.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903315732"}

This case study shows how well-established missing data theory can be applied to efficacy data collected in a long-term open-label trial with a discontinuation rate of almost 50%. Satisfaction with treatment in chronically constipated patients was the efficacy measure assessed at baseline and every 3 months postbaseline. The improvement in treatment satisfaction from baseline was originally analyzed with a paired t-test ignoring missing data and discarding the correlation structure of the longitudinal data. As the original analysis started from missing completely at random assumptions regarding the missing data process, the satisfaction data were re-examined, and several missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) techniques resulted in adjusted estimate for the improvement in satisfaction over 12 months. Throughout the different sensitivity analyses, the effect sizes remained significant and clinically relevant. Thus, even for an open-label trial design, sensitivity analysis, with different assumptions for the nature of dropouts (MAR or MNAR) and with different classes of models (selection, pattern-mixture, or multiple imputation models), has been found useful and provides evidence towards the robustness of the original analyses; additional sensitivity analyses could be undertaken to further qualify robustness.","inCitations":["2d2fdfa72ff4ae592a599dcdbe1c52953a510eab"],"title":"Handling of missing data in long-term clinical trials: a case study.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1532"}

However, in medical studies it is not uncommon for biomarkers to be censored at known detection limits. A computationally-efficient multiple imputation procedure for modeling survival data with covariates subject to detection limits is proposed. This procedure is developed in the context of an accelerated failure time model with a flexible seminonparametric error distribution. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the multiple imputation estimator are established and a consistent variance estimator is provided. An iterative version of the proposed multiple imputation algorithm that approximates the EM algorithm for maximum likelihood is also suggested. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed multiple imputation methods work well while alternative methods lead to estimates that are either biased or more variable. The proposed methods are applied to analyze the dataset from a recently-conducted GenIMS study.","inCitations":["c2b16ff34219d2b6c602a492e8a6ce162b61f81a","a95cad2f034f9c4079a967e901dfd19b64e19c2f","60e71bed6fff5f782b84434c61f61f72f4a37cad","7f47a88e77e3ac24fb9f37aee2cbd5bd145c3e9b","40e010a243b9628665d4344ce17c745016c063af","cdcfbbdb078fb24d6066888fbd23e0031e26fc2a","85f18d08759a2605e5c2cbfd2c0f8b2cfecb01f9","6a24df6b39ca40bcf87f8f2fe7738b900a3b0828","2f737098a891eafc59ef7c536a21ef76df2b75e6","1b52d5d7438b5161a7552032278fd51c905be39b","db6ec30e24d5adcbafbf021fd8dec3925b5524f3","73c6c27185958d90d8065a1f701026cc42d8539b"],"title":"Flexible modeling of survival data with covariates subject to detection limits via multiple imputation","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2013.07.027"}

Genotyping individuals for these variations has the potential to help redefine how pharmacologic agents undergo clinical development. By identifying carriers of known genomic variants that contribute to susceptibility, a high-risk population can be defined, as well as individuals with potential for a better response to a drug. We evaluated the potential utility that selecting individuals for a trial on the basis of genotypes identified in contemporary GWA studies would have had on recently described clinical trials. We pursued this by constraining both the risks of a disease outcome associated with particular genotypes and overall drug responses to those actually observed in genetic association and clinical trial studies, respectively. We pursued these evaluations in the context of clinical trials investigating drugs for macular degeneration, obesity, heart disease, type II diabetes, prostate cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. We show that the increase in incidence of outcomes in trials restricted to individuals with specific genotypic profiles can result in substantial reductions in requisite sample sizes for such trials. In addition, we also derive realistic bounds for samples sizes for clinical trials investigating pharmacogenetic effects that leverage genetic variations identified in recent association studies.","inCitations":["4652a403335c7f7a0dd681b690853d80e5c45733","e6f8fe3b86811dada3f3746e171bece38072d42a","e1b1c3aac33e3beb96f1e0beb17ac20031a20a44","a10eb07a00c5aff9b65be66e2f7b31b121855d4d","cd273f714999a9547d0761bacdcf0521fbb45e24","dd658c27aef13b895eb2a522e051feb8d9b6ff0c","8a8347c9566a28a1ed8cbad73223942be5cb10e5","a3d4c145819497becad87168fd224eeffa111f37","ac2c6fa613d635a745db58e5c624a2c47a03a963","0b48c4ff23ebb038d0337fbbcfa6ef1d10f2d0f1","babb5ce0391950b2dfe1b504ff3e90b681add7e4","e88ca7cf97705573f011faf6edb76ec17721ce72","477bc16df6301149a7c291866cfd104cbf3fe59c","36d940e18dc9aeddef15eb217a295092ee846543"],"title":"Genotype-based risk and pharmacogenetic sampling in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903572779"}

This is appealing to clinicians because it allows a sufficient number of patients to be assigned to each of the lower dose levels before escalating to higher dose levels. While a theoretical framework to build the two-stage CRM has been proposed, the selection of the initial dose-escalating sequence, generally referred to as the initial design, remains arbitrary, either by specifying cohorts of three patients or by trial and error through extensive simulations. Motivated by a currently ongoing oncology dose-finding study for which clinicians explicitly stated their desire to assign at least one patient to each of the lower dose levels, we proposed a systematic approach for selecting the initial design for the two-stage CRM. The initial design obtained using the proposed algorithm yields better operating characteristics compared to using a cohort of three initial design with a calibrated CRM. The proposed algorithm simplifies the selection of initial design for the two-stage CRM. Moreover, initial designs to be used as reference for planning a two-stage CRM are provided.","inCitations":["673d5d8a01019a11f85ba1bca5a9632e30c36f3a"],"title":"Selection of the initial design for the two-stage continual reassessment method.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1290650"}

In addition, we also use the average of all available PP's as the explanatory variable in a linear regression model. Next, a two-stage process is applied. The longitudinal PP is modeled using a linear mixed-effects model. This modeled PP is used in the regression model to describe PWV. An approach for using the longitudinal PP data is to obtain a measure of cumulative burden, the area under the PP curve (AUC). This AUC is used as an explanatory variable to model PWV.

Only 500 colors are used to measure the expression levels of the 1,000 landmark genes measured, and the data for the resulting pairs of genes are deconvolved. The raw data are sometimes inadequate for reliable deconvolution, leading to artifacts in the final processed data. These include the expression levels of paired genes being flipped or given the same value, and clusters of values that are not at the true expression level. We propose a new method called model-based clustering with data correction (MCDC) that is able to identify and correct these three kinds of artifacts simultaneously. We show that MCDC improves the resulting gene expression data in terms of agreement with external baselines, as well as improving results from subsequent analysis.","inCitations":["8b7d4b22bbc2cb13d14f97630bd29aafd778b7bd","a62c47cc8957d81e6e13c2cab48577d46bd41e0d","c8ca5feb537c4e2c829da1d511b781bf4d26064f","f9b2de05fc6664b97c024e662a95d73ec6f19e32","603e7c634213b33a763d44d7e6f44be33c36bd58","7f8caa7cab1089e9aca9ac384a866fa45271a298","eea7c95529541053a3072e368f19b55074e73b14"],"title":"Model-Based Clustering With Data Correction For Removing Artifacts In Gene Expression Data.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1051"}
