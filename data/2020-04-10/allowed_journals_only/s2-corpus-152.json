However, the assay controls, which are used to monitor the assay performance and set acceptance criteria, should have no or less interassay variability. In this paper, we develop a mixed-effect calibration model for the assay controls to set new acceptance criteria and qualify the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) data, which incorporates the interassay variation of assay standards and the nature of the assay controls, and overcomes the problems caused by traditional fixed-effect calibration model.","inCitations":["c6f61f5fc61d3a999361531ed2c551bf0f177e1a","aae8b6baf02a03c291b77b1245ee0c65370fc6ca","ff18768fc63ba83b14ea2ded1b8236fc5d28aa85"],"title":"Qualifying ELISA data: combining information.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100101983"}

A novel statistical method, the multi-order Markov chain model has been recently developed to quantify the complexity level of multilocus LD patterns among single nucleotide polymorphism markers (Kim et al., 2008). In this study, mathematical relationships between two types of LD measures are derived to understand the Markov chain model parameters in terms of conventional LD measures. Statistical sample properties of the Markov chain order estimates are investigated by simulations. Two published data sets are reanalyzed to illustrate the proposed approach.","inCitations":["d05f619e2a3196d6a0bd698a62c941b17cb64ca5","9522eedb284aa09fb1a8888e1e2a58c5c9a32c02","bbf75855fedcb3be1b5ec4fd2f8a29e2c41a07a6","0c85eed96f453f2b3b562fe08281cbf29975b279","f820cb1133e98eefb78651126de9d4cdbcfc0bfb"],"title":"Summarizing and quantifying multilocus linkage disequilibrium patterns with multi-order Markov chain models.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903572837"}

Numerical approximations for their quantiles are developed on a distribution-by-distribution basis. This work develops a general approximation for quantiles using the Taylor expansion. Our method only requires that the distribution has a continuous probability density function and its derivatives can be derived to a certain order (usually 3 or 4). We demonstrate our unified approach by approximating the quantiles of the normal, exponential, and chi-square distributions. The approximation works well for these distributions.","inCitations":["58d4e119cc32c9256d6908055ccb12144343a0aa","bb59c5923db1b0529caf8df7540b29c1484a2bbe"],"title":"A general approximation to quantiles.","doi":"10.1080/03610926.2016.1222433"}

The latent space model proposed by (Hoff et al. 2002), and extended by (Handcock et al. 2007) to incorporate clustering, provides a visually interpretable model-based spatial representation of relational data and takes account of several intrinsic network properties. Due to the structure of the likelihood function of the latent space model, the computational cost is of order O(N2), where N is the number of nodes. This makes it infeasible for large networks. In this paper, we propose an approximation of the log likelihood function. We adopt the case-control idea from epidemiology and construct a case-control likelihood which is an unbiased estimator of the full likelihood. Replacing the full likelihood by the case-control likelihood in the MCMC estimation of the latent space model reduces the computational time from O(N2) to O(N), making it feasible for large networks. We evaluate its performance using simulated and real data.

In this study, we validated a method to extract information from cross-sectional survey for quantifying population dynamics of adolescent smoking behavior progression.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWith a 3-stage 7-path model, probabilities of smoking behavior progression were estimated employing the Probabilistic Discrete Event System (PDES) method and the cross-sectional data from 1997-2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Validity of the PDES method was assessed using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and trends in smoking transition covering the period during which funding for tobacco control was cut substantively in 2003 in the United States.\n\n\nRESULTS\nProbabilities for all seven smoking progression paths were successfully estimated with the PDES method and the NSDUH data. The absolute difference in the estimated probabilities between the two approaches varied from 0.002 to 0.076 (p>0.05 for all) and were highly correlated with each other (R2 =0.998, p<0.01). Changes in the estimated transitional probabilities across the 1997-2006 reflected the 2003 funding cut for tobacco control.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe PDES method has validity in quantifying population dynamics of smoking behavior progression with cross-sectional survey data. The estimated transitional probabilities add new evidence supporting more advanced tobacco research, tobacco control planning and tobacco use prevention practice. This method can be easily extended to study other health risk behaviors.","inCitations":["e4b5161ea56dcd62d763cd4d5ce9a33ed3bd7345","305e1224574906511223b7f644cc9806cc9884ac","1879ae0bea9d8d51479b4e12408b07cd62a64e63","8b151c991747a97b5a0a8c373c5b070187866e59","c1d8edb4c9eaae4b8128f0bbe56f2e59a00a9ad3","fa0ffeb1fb127db9909a8a0c108bcbb0ddbbdad7","b05a41c67738852acfac8964ef47d8d5ada81c6d","d7b15fca454b747108be420b6be14faccad8a3ce"],"title":"Estimating Transitional Probabilities with Cross-Sectional Data to Assess Smoking Behavior Progression: A Validation Analysis.","doi":"10.4172/2155-6180.S1-004"}

For trials in which recurrent event endpoints are of interests, conventional analyses using the proportional intensity model or the count model assume that the data are missing at random, which cannot be tested using the observed data alone. Thus, sensitivity analyses are recommended. We implement the control-based multiple imputation as sensitivity analyses for the recurrent event data. We model the recurrent event using a piecewise exponential proportional intensity model with frailty and sample the parameters from the posterior distribution. We impute the number of events after dropped out and correct the variance estimation using a bootstrap procedure. We apply the method to an application of sitagliptin study.","inCitations":["4ef1ad17c21c85461c5418680253dcb6f2ba5b7d"],"title":"Control-based imputation for sensitivity analyses in informative censoring for recurrent event data.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1821"}

Estimation of an uncountable collection of conditional distributions across different regions of the predictor space is a challenging problem, which differs in some important ways from density and mean regression estimation problems. Defining various topologies on the space of conditional distributions, we provide sufficient conditions for posterior consistency focusing on a broad class of priors formulated as predictor-dependent mixtures of Gaussian kernels. This theory is illustrated by showing that the conditions are satisfied for a class of generalized stick-breaking process mixtures in which the stick-breaking lengths are monotone, differentiable functions of a continuous stochastic process. We also provide a set of sufficient conditions for the case where stick-breaking lengths are predictor independent, such as those arising from a fixed Dirichlet process prior.","inCitations":["3d9218347228dd83046e1e3a18b028ef53063cb2","445ec3c876208a33f81129573caabeba8aeeff94","db52e2c6a040fb54a0ee91840c61b83439b3803a","39e1bdf3b0079478cd1ad8d3509b3ef51454ff9e","f8ec2a27966eda494e0b7605d6971d1a80f8ea70","16148f76ef12a49f6d693dc1c2b35f17617e6120","99d158e246b0e68cbbb2720ce36c5541607a68f6","a328faf454bec0ad841aed0084ce8ce475b75d46","739eba8b42f48458d5faeb3596a3557a9dd322ea","47d4f3b5379e9596a658514b8c9b7322b3230f56","43db36fb9ddebf4da12f3cced72e8a9892fe3ddb","e046ebe73023d4e42795e2eb011b38d0c71fe958","b6dac87562ce1e1e2628e04bc9e5b07111f016b8","a2e2991cdf1f1e98453a6baac14f23a74cadb5b6","b4148b0dcf4d519a54f25fa24d68f566b9591631","e6bc832f452e88d2e896ca7677d962372cd945f6","4901a799f69ea22ee6b8ce3e2929c0c2c4aaa742","e248832b76e5dfd2c48ed196b8b9c5fc3dfec812","cdd34b431b8d580fff46dbc0b08043d11cbc623c","1a7ed7af13e5341855edf56638dfa94550c77dee","1c8e221fe3a687deda41289e1728427e52aba97b","93919547a26ce7ca28591a82e05589f4be7876a1","41b0a53b8d573a6e13d837999e847445c735d415","8c43c54327dcd2e99bf727c2ab4851a61d45de67","1d7ca3c549b19ed51f41a6558ec15b1bf1dea839","ccc6e1362717592bd95e2232487a5c96aa79f58c","a139fd5e7656ebe426da69331e787fe72c2e1668","4da0e9b1d0b8b6fcd8a8449ec793cf9368f0c239","c0daa0c17eaa04533209bf42fa54d710fdfae295","c07eec33ee3ee6105f2076189f89eef560e2e803","6b85cf8eb795f849c9c859d1649311de66069c2d","e69309c3228496477c3425ec5fb7a90af75fe8e3","222df7fa704b5382c8c75b069fc483945f39003a","4ffe33a40c7de724f87e5043ec58d896c92d571f","4a0298fd72d926889f76a52c5f089439b5df6ba0","9fd517da7b0b3003213c887b11e52927e4647203","4329dec664f4a3f5c02ad7def18634f14e1681c1","334e1ccd6877e39f080b2f3f9dc70872c32093da","788b8bcee4df923f2981333f5799d0dae8498e97","79e8b7128d8750c58e987b528dcae6bf62046417","c8a2ff2c7a8f56faa13279d9427d9dcc9dffbe1f","6ffd3fcbac8ac6bbbd47dfd048d6e79b1eebadfd","2efe91cc26a064fd7dc7983a0be649b7b49344ab","a9e922d273736d08d68c1726ee5c93270fcc65ad","8f183346b17c5d4491b5a16281b7e0c1290429b6","ff56a2f1802eb6842a829a40d8512dc6617507d0","b625ff3431cef89ce22c49b9a5eaf0bc4c866519","45e8e23ac1857dbc09773a6d178c3b3946a2f062"],"title":"Posterior consistency in conditional distribution estimation","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2013.01.011"}

An experiment or interlaboratory study is performed to estimate the repeatability, the intermediate precision, and the reproducibility of the analytical method. These measures of precision are quantified by appropriate sums of variance components from an analysis of variance model describing the structure of the data. In the literature, several methods have been described for calculating approximate (closed-form) confidence intervals on sums of variance components, i.e., Welch, Satterthwaite, and modified large-sample (MLS). Comparisons between these methods have been performed for one-way and two-way classification analysis of variance models only. Interlaboratory studies though often need higher order classifications. Therefore, these methods for constructing confidence intervals are compared on the measures of precision from a specfic three-way classification analysis of variance model that is frequently used for method transfer studies. Using a simulation study, the coverage probability for these methods is evaluated in situations where variance components may be estimated negatively with the standard moment estimates and where either the standard moment estimates are adjusted to zero or remain unadjusted. The MLS method is superior to the other two methods in case the standard moment estimates are used. If the adjusted moment estimates are used, then the method of Satterthwaite performs similar to the MLS method for many settings of the variance components and sample sizes but much better for some particular settings. The method of Satterthwaite performs better than the method of Welch for all the selected settings of variance components and sample sizes, irrespective of the standard or adjusted moment estimates.","inCitations":["b8bb6ea005370255ea2e7223fb8266f26dd8761a"],"title":"Closed-form confidence intervals on measures of precision for an interlaboratory study.","doi":"10.1080/10543400601001519"}

We handle these challenges with a novel approach that does not impose restrictive modeling or distributional assumptions. Using a logit transformation, we relate the distribution for clustered failure times to covariates and a random, subject-specific effect. The covariates are modeled with unknown functional forms, and the random effect may depend on the covariates and have an unknown and unspecified distribution. We introduce pseudovalues to handle censoring and splines for functional covariate effects, and frame the problem into fitting an additive logistic mixed effects model. Unlike existing approaches for fitting such models, we develop semiparametric techniques that estimate the functional model parameters without specifying or estimating the random effect distribution. We show both theoretically and empirically that the resulting estimators are consistent for any choice of random effect distribution and any dependency structure between the random effect and covariates. Last, we illustrate the method's utility in an application to a Huntington's disease study where our method provides new insights into differences between motor and cognitive impairment event times in at-risk subjects.","inCitations":["6305738c32e66d46431ba608fe641c9a5a2212f2"],"title":"Robust Mixed Effects Model for Clustered Failure Time Data: Application to Huntington's Disease Event Measures.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1038"}

This class of models incorporates an effective age function encoding the effect of changes after each event occurrence such as the impact of an intervention, it models the impact of accumulating event occurrences on the unit, it admits a link function in which the effect of possibly time-dependent covariates are incorporated, and it allows the incorporation of unobservable frailty components which induce dependencies among the inter-event times for each unit. The estimation procedures are semiparametric in that a baseline hazard function is nonparametrically specified. The sampling distribution properties of the estimators are examined through a simulation study, and the consequences of mis-specifying the model are analyzed. The results indicate that the flexibility of this general class of models provides a safeguard for analyzing recurrent event data, even data possibly arising from a frailtyless mechanism. The estimation procedures are applied to real data sets arising in the biomedical and public health settings, as well as from reliability and engineering situations. In particular, the procedures are applied to a data set pertaining to times to recurrence of bladder cancer and the results of the analysis are compared to those obtained using three methods of analyzing recurrent event data.","inCitations":["2559ebd672e89dcdddaa0268f8db1c4c82843323","1fb50136045b4335dc711cebbb37c97d226b8f3d","73ce18c0571113b6f05370b1f86454bc15c0e319","17f212138b7371bc554cd8b33f15804e182ebe99","bab85e4379906143c210c050931064ebaf1d7b79","20dd8606d71596f9747b01aa8224188269a5d1f8","c5312204d03a0c259026e213b8742f4d64d25cab","267f7b0d3928a15ecac6404f764d26943a65c3ff","32e10706b4142ba592e5ae91ddbab9a3aa14c889","153da53546a54ac909531686598ab5ce39d3d836","e7e3c02baabc30c70f7631a0e6cc3c9618d79f5f","fb544d48d5b63782b11b70b8e80aef891e7f9cf2","9fbcfb45176f20a8130954dfe1ed960d25dade1f","0af7b3a77e895eaeb8e7d3c9019430c334d88f14","c3bddc2d5abd1421b58bdd4fa9b95418ab65c622","f0e94e6a678fd33189424a2c794e8b2a60dcdb79","6e4b1149d98568247fa7339779faa36ace59b81e","553ba34e5ba1a5764a395ad36e6ae17a45a2c4ec","8cb65063963e5fe31d6172cd729c5639e3b0aa19","08e5b26bd0a30c9349c3410befd56941a6ceb6b2","c3fb3e528e95afcc02b0b64b3aa5fa0e403c6ac2","8117a432a9b219b1a73fd59f85a589eaab14a2a5","3888acc82f2fef26a3e022ebe76d3b30a2503c31","f3d6b46d0bb2f22c217dadc16f0702da7c787b15","ef2c2223b710c108fa70975d171bbe0a954056a5","04d717cafc49d8a452a2469aa77a0fca1a912f77","965d9f0c0abe2a0dd46e48827abed7a8c3dd3f8c","f23d29532ffb20ff85ad51947ffcf2ac15fe0b21","1089e69372df40013419dbe6f57ee05bd6877c07","af25a776a900d65b930818644c38be07089d7acc","b15b519eea48693e2ece6454a6eb7dea8da33624"],"title":"Semiparametric Inference for a General Class of Models for Recurrent Events.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2006.05.004"}

In the last decade, many multiple factor designs were proposed in stability studies. With the objective of model selection, the generalization of the conventional ANCOVA model using type I sum of squares to designs with multiple factors requires a prespecified hierarchical pooling test ordering to determine whether any of the factors may be eliminated. Different shelf life estimates may be derived using different hierarchical pooling test orderings. On the other hand, setting the hierarchical ordering can be subjective and controversial. The stepwise modeling based on F-tests using type III sum of squares for model determination and factor elimination is proposed to eliminate such difficulties.","inCitations":["00eb56da224c5bd7bab33b5708269299254319af","b28542bce9f1a00a90e6a0ce1daa836fc318d489","c3bc6b1bfde06d7b792a905a10676aa899264618","07fc3ad095587266937ae8c3841e8241a2b037b6","d2c8143578d1601465e4127c65033d188ca1decc"],"title":"ANCOVA approach for shelf life analysis of stability study of multiple factor designs.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120022761"}

In this article, we review the major challenges of multiplicity, statistical methods available to assess consistency of effect, and the part appropriate design plays in mitigating the risk of false conclusions from subgroup analyses. We discuss the problems associated with using definitions of consistency based on effect sizes in specific subgroups. We argue that what is required is a return to basic statistical principles, including more use of modeling techniques.","inCitations":["2822cd4f41962615b1ae6e1a8480a3c4afe1b33f"],"title":"Subgroups: time to go back to basic statistical principles?","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.856019"}
