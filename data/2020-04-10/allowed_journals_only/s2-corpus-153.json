Extracting useful information from such massive datasets is an ongoing challenge as traditional data visualization tools typically do not scale well in high-dimensional settings. An existing visualization technique that is particularly well suited to visualizing large datasets is the heatmap. Although heatmaps are extremely popular in fields such as bioinformatics, they remain a severely underutilized visualization tool in modern data analysis. This paper introduces superheat, a new R package that provides an extremely flexible and customizable platform for visualizing complex datasets. Superheat produces attractive and extendable heatmaps to which the user can add a response variable as a scatterplot, model results as boxplots, correlation information as barplots, and more. The goal of this paper is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of the heatmap as a core visualization method for a range of data types, and (2) to highlight the customizability and ease of implementation of the superheat R package for creating beautiful and extendable heatmaps. The capabilities and fundamental applicability of the superheat package will be explored via three reproducible case studies, each based on publicly available data sources.","inCitations":["446175ce8bfbe95aef8b43901c7b198098961416","5a5eef05b28e1395e706169288cd05c9a1dd42c0","4b08decc04b92ee6c7368d91e697695b6008ba60","4af2645b7b8a22e0680e263a3da83bab1a3c3c3f","404b1968a7711e17f394667c20a6fbd4b7f8a1b3","0f494b62280099e95ae1dedeeceb55394a24d4cf","6928b3b7a39f32ae59af9997df2e169ba31f022a","29d1b6483225b47d5f962cede854842595cdb1c7","a263d54c63e58f7351b8a4cad4fe2a4ac5e29b3d","891d644dde9b80e7c25f6dd8b984bdc3da9f8d9d","7082945c21390bd643c786287e96138a6223d5af","4cd173d6440893134461da764a2a69473e39fbc4","68aa438c64d49e3c755cc2c7f82009325823ab61","e271ccd8961eb0fa547ca7dccf51124fc9605170","0858718e151e27d4eb6eb3bdc2b7120d8a993a5c","42e1f1e83807b22d7f9686fe49a0865451d0125c","6747a38ceb91723526bea6a251c1c550eb21dfac","09a5a7450700a08b9021e836bd50f0e795413524","c4cb82e85bb9509b521f65a178c99ef1b50b689b","6f96f9f10b4eb3a552d0b79cc89bced260c65b00","4cc1665e5cc7237bea830b88d1aa3dc06231f837","39cd1d7a8e4a1295c0716d59b234f3991688cb11","b7e98fb11bb97485598e4257e27c7e33309d7253","3f0d2f5e9a1d58f057b9f3c4b77ee30bc812f694","12b157a63937b632a0b84804a6da4d2a33023d88","8a7d011e4f7c1f15d59ff2aac53eea850e2a2856","a606bcfdf9675733005ea15a06eb024f3c26db21","7ff66a7f6ebeb8923cdb5e1befeb7544d320fa7d","ebc28ebffa1c089edcc2bb7d99e5cd563e4d6542"],"title":"Superheat: An R package for creating beautiful and extendable heatmaps for visualizing complex data.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2018.1473780"}

Although many methods are proposed, they suffer from several deficiencies including difficulties of setting fit-for-purpose acceptable limits, dependency on concentration levels used in linearity experiment, and challenges in implementation for statistically lay users. In this article, a statistical procedure for testing linearity is proposed. The method uses a two one-sided test (TOST) of equivalence to evaluate the bias that can result from approximating a higher-order polynomial response with a linear function. By using orthogonal polynomials and generalized pivotal quantity analysis, the method provides a closed-form solution, thus making linearity testing easy to implement.","inCitations":["13878169b8eca97cff580e5f74264bb3accb2620","a2bbc1157f89ebcbef3ae69324549c357759c70b","5a1e805b9a58c97ea658ed132b8d20c8dcebdabf","0771e852edf87bafab982ed3f16b79a3abcad7d4","e1b7e1427103d3adcc6e79a61c5809f921c4a562","18291306fa456890b5c8797d91f954f92f676e30","9d0cd21a034a4deded3e41ebc7ad7bbd14c0512a","504ec00f9d960b45e788a02af6b1c916beac5710","84475cb1a0d3d784c0dcdadf313375ab8564b87f"],"title":"Testing assay linearity over a pre-specified range.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.972513"}

This has encouraged collection of large spatial datasets in many fields and has generated considerable interest in statistical modeling for location-referenced spatial data. The setting where the number of locations yielding observations is too large to fit the desired hierarchical spatial random effects models using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is considered. This problem is exacerbated in spatial-temporal and multivariate settings where many observations occur at each location. The recently proposed predictive process, motivated by kriging ideas, aims to maintain the richness of desired hierarchical spatial modeling specifications in the presence of large datasets. A shortcoming of the original formulation of the predictive process is that it induces a positive bias in the non-spatial error term of the models. A modified predictive process is proposed to address this problem. The predictive process approach is knot-based leading to questions regarding knot design. An algorithm is designed to achieve approximately optimal spatial placement of knots. Detailed illustrations of the modified predictive process using multivariate spatial regression with both a simulated and a real dataset are offered.","inCitations":["49dcc9f6c5f3c2d8b0a09dfaf37194f28ac5e8cb","363ac8aea766ad2991abf45a1c632fbcf1d49126","af8ac27e34e2d85f2cb8439edb50547a42c76593","b798af3e9ac164d3d8e97fad2073397000f76604","bf93dc5955878aee7f8eed00a3d482210b7f111a","3b04afa8801b77d7de202e1ed339613e7c0522eb","017171c4c65091329b662b9198c507f0d4717fd6","a197b5e02d4effb1df5a249d41b975a8aa70d9b5","2dddd2be8d505e41b59b5ff4ed88c08a10d29357","18bbaaddd01f778f8f8cc7c23a8ed4c5f8c5964b","93545cadc58ae02d73cbf14c7d3b40b671cac0ad","b02db2979bf68ecedcb7653d2904bb6af5cbec87","aef152aa0320536381eea61dbe2f5b7e83089a60","38690abc15aeff3e9709d2fc5ded208b89ed13be","a6e2903a798194e71ffceadef2301a64e9427289","4a50d428ab9fa2194e8ca78031c9620d00525e93","0409b7fda6f3763c6e2f9b8d125394e1a64aa96e","9a63563b464c0d93f787898563c2433c25a14654","aa051ea61b59fe29e6cab96d684146835ff9fc4a","65a587fe3e41d949b0fbf34162080c57a0b58c34","0830b69daa7a23bb8cedcb3411e2cba2fddf2c03","ba50fa375f164c5cba1cb83e8cd9a19a4c0c2977","67fce855ff3a08e79103ce5242614df6c2a0a9c1","58de7a14eba521f9d22e397ddfe884454845a24d","7382b6349e22c92e24be9ab0892653653212ecf2","c8e1952f3a20803bd53e420dd1b37ea9089992fd","386ffc63a621ddd390ce9a71e99acdfb30f2faac","a5ed0ee2f5bd2f505fbb2f3677ed3e4e91aaa15d","8ada86f4adc007ffedc53029dc297677feefec0e","c4287893bcc284435684bae2225763377a8bf3ed","60c8fcd938b515848887c529104f319b26896869","5710fcd521080fa3e0f749819e6fac7d63a3485a","7f41aa5deaa16b8ff4cc334185bb63ce0a280bbc","bf4b917f280d468ab7e7a1ba5fa1714de37b0a45","361001b5d2def1ba6b7b590b54cce118ab5b148b","237a2413ce1cd65e0bee921b0fe3508e03b30c12","40273078b6c8f12e2f92384246579460ca39e54f","ea82d403d865c13e5efd441e50b7a4d52f1cfe36","b3b8303359846d6325564757022b69090d79b254","3b7e4faffef5ce25f78a3cd1545e05b2dea8674a","f6b3229833af490506a3267f9ff6375cb37510d0","ee1286f0a3fcee62fc119dcf7e0051c5bb0612b3","e24001d68cd700df4a74d5998d56a3363214a3ce","49770f77558f125325ce6911f42b99c6bb3c0dba","f349e3dde57356839096e856112d12999820f784","cf5b978c803362adc10486659ca19c6493946831","4469a5251ca5817131584e31a785afe89f202cd1","7120d281622a6175dd6b1e184eaca9a88e62a423","0202b59c8feb6cc8021526c37816801ab61d2ceb","04c83a7f581f326ca75ca6df48ee90da3d539d9c","5144ec19e601938f84cc2157a161254d8b600036","8071326e86c650164466dd7d116dca2c1c436321","be0e539f0960ccd04d29ec3eebfefd7265d1714d","7e2965adf3672dc23da5047b352c39071392d1cd","a354b4fca9b8c3a1e57b05a4c2cf5d2e063ee3ef","c6eef2662a9d95246c507107a2d2d02794293a95","bbdba4df0c6a538a29088953b8d3347a72c76f90","883d70bfbfc99baaee5fe19a652244df961b4b3d","dde9deae3bfc87343f8141ba0234240883b819b4","c76a69c1a43c8b4bf995079a6a66266aa8b3fbc0","78a347bd7dbf0b219727f60d803ae6780e06c50f","54454d3c156a6ee537e1dfb98623fac9ccf5366a","21779e944b53bf43133f5635369ce7f9b83d3f67","69b27f497bf1584d7295553e992f76c50afce040","6e8a84941ab3374886cb70e291de486ea9854e6c","8d381a63294d39faff38bab716cea2a41dea6b17","fa8808b92b601f37daaebb398d547196f3e5d0b0","74fa40b135b96bd084d164da4418555d4eb988fc","47d82d5d86a4b49e8685bdc6c9ffb7a9b8885b0e","5bd2d1051849549eb586c7a74071fd1b0357be41","d1a075fd8a1fe7e77e38038b48630aa4203cfbf6","0407eecdd0c5fbfbf252851af3a25e3c72b234c2","590ffc860f1e4f0372242949a6218d96b62982b5","83615636f44997b96f92ffe0f71f2a7e022949b6","803e73d9772e70651efd699c7a95045013fa5394","9d6e9b714ddd56b0060b1a646e7f3c9a281b69c2","8defeff62122ec37951a93c8bf200556e6671c24","e41be411b376522fb1b9765c71753bba78060a0a","61edb1be7a55857348d7434e977cc31a5b7aa485","15e436ee7cb55fd497689a5262eb205753cca42c","6d87617765fac50bc7136ebf8c7ce6e9d2db27ae","f5978edac55dbde01f793e9416bf405d7691fc88","ebb33cd8fcf92efba728fdeb113c8c705c01dc4e","3a3a2270c830f2e28a33109cd25c1dcefc283813","702d854df72aee7034282e1d456b780a74a07f9d","dcfd68c94548bce124efb91cb71eca78c9fdd30c","2fe72b449e639130d7a37230c622c2bdb92b0316","2197bc37065e1b8ac0bd4bb1185109dfb08ac5f0","6d24c6184a01b2cabfd6f9de4836ab40e345c219","83075cc466e559b603b51f0a36d3582f9dc98126","989e9256031bde954008f5ca35fae5f73c1b3027","1966629e0e7dbabf20ca0bf3fce3de7511736c19","4df6736f9e57ee52dfa250081965597f438ba071","c60f1038f98bd0241ddd7e33150a6c864462b3bc","74edbc354fdf63aec1ce187e83e10b592deda1ff","ce191f7d42f5a9a48a88659b59468b2a1055cb76","494e613a8ad84a3891580b071937e1a5ee9914ff","2fbd43ab75c1373095b0a61e2011c91e66e889fb","2f3095fef59d0c06a76d1b7468b7f704160c043c","47ae1f9819faec8da750ea8f81840fcd6d6faa7e","879c63fc1baf8a803b60e815fd57c8baf7c413ec","317760e443d434904d636b3ad3265abe4bc57b7c","44f347498f8b7e6808aa81a3ebf3747f49c21529","4a1944152ba0282f85fce7a7e918cf8686b5a901","863d33385fcce0693db7ae2ca885fd464e1288cc","0216cc58689534e3434f625187974f58da02712a","70804fd635073e1a1cac95856f62830f04edadac","1be83f5a6b798f03c54a70cd7b18fc516d950849","1323cba66c8d6c75be41bc7393345c25458e702c","f65d09863fd937d3959d894190b9224359c8ded4","328c0cff2db2310d6295ea35ed6cf03375cd35f8","f0c5c0041a1b8677b4f552d3d224af88037ab5c7","fd0f6880cb0372eddccb0db556ae5dd343a2499d","0e090cd81ae9e855e72e8a6ccee11c63697bcc14","93b28869a9f689fc80f047257c45411d64108bf3","48efeccd9288fbe5ff81c8f0d0b69

This situation can occur in a number of settings, where individual membership is unknown but aggregate membership is known. When the mixture component size, i.e., the aggregate mixture component membership, is known, it is common practice to treat only the mixing probability as known. This approach does not, however, entirely account for the fact that the number of observations within each mixture component is known, which may result in artificially incorrect estimates of parameters. By fully capitalizing on the available information, the proposed EM algorithm shows robustness to the choice of starting values and exhibits numerically stable convergence properties.","inCitations":["d82befab3a185b4934cf85247e1985917419a591","53b6e86423c48dc6b4c1610c38111038cc4495dc","b35ab3d6775c626a8a22ffaf460924e86b4d4852"],"title":"EM Estimation for Finite Mixture Models with Known Mixture Component Size","doi":"10.1080/03610918.2013.824091"}

Nested models are used to ascertain whether the AUC statistic increases when new factors enter the model. The regression coefficient estimates used in the AUC statistics are computed using the maximum rank correlation methodology. Typically, inference for the difference in AUC statistics from nested models is derived under asymptotic normality. In this work, it is demonstrated that the asymptotic normality is true only when at least one of the new factors is associated with the binary outcome. When none of the new factors are associated with the binary outcome, the asymptotic distribution for the difference in AUC statistics is a linear combination of chi-square random variables. Further, when at least one new factor is associated with the outcome and the population difference is small, a variance stabilizing reparameterization improves the asymptotic normality of the AUC difference statistic. A confidence interval using this reparameterization is developed and simulations are generated to determine their coverage properties. The derived confidence interval provides information on the magnitude of the added value of new factors and enables investigators to weigh the size of the improvement against potential costs associated with the new factors. A pancreatic cancer data example is used to illustrate this approach.","inCitations":["4c595cfc6a5923ffac92dbbbcb91263c94b0eb70","3b3bb498af6f356f4389825f4f3b026edcaef4f0"],"title":"Inference for the difference in the area under the ROC curve derived from nested binary regression models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw045"}

Applications with experimental foot-and-mouth disease and historical smallpox data are discussed, and simulation results are presented. Inference is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods following a Bayesian approach. Model evaluation is performed, where the adequacy of the models is assessed using methodology based on the properties of Bayesian latent residuals, and comparison between 2 candidate models is also considered using a latent likelihood ratio-type test that avoids problems encountered with relevant methods based on Bayes factors.","inCitations":["f3b6cdd81625da8719781fa1b408020e1fb9d7a8","553af5e471ace1b86f128e0a23574cfb80b23101","044d0be6144b40311536e29d7b81acb9ca84a78f","9e1f67516560e04cef0f17af9ff7984249f96d17","fd9d8e1a5bdbfef63a1fe558b1b6e7a45b4c9efb","195aef057ab4b24a9b9844f4a11963af5b7fa58e","498c983b54496f26ee5ec72f2e6678fdef178b66","a76b2d0b54018888185e444078d83d3eea9dafa2","84a6bb685f76d6e21c4e018cdc3360172efe6b0e","2309fc430b90b54ea60f785d9d31850f92919f11","e6e5a33f66047b9d1cc01c20b5af33220a203849"],"title":"Non-exponential tolerance to infection in epidemic systems--modeling, inference, and assessment.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs011"}

The polypeptide is assumed to be adsorbed to the interface between a polar and a non-polar environment such as realized by water and the lipid bilayer of a membrane. The interfacial coil-helix transformation is the first stage in the folding process of helical membrane proteins. Depending on the values of model parameters, the conformation changes as a crossover, a discontinuous transition, or a continuous transition with helicity in the role of order parameter. Our model is constructed as a system of statistically interacting quasiparticles that are activated from the helix pseudo-vacuum. The particles represent links between adjacent residues in coil conformation that form a self-avoiding random walk in two dimensions. Explicit results are presented for helicity, entropy, heat capacity, and the average numbers and sizes of sboth coil and helix segments.","inCitations":["37f5e599c5050251537f038d7da7a4a02d9e3954","2f159964b4c47887be8118bb052755fb0d384fbc","c9aba64c50cf6d517cc021a4d0d56131aa365fe8","66c7dc0314104464ce4ad7cf80cd431e46bca698","cff17b3dc00e48f81bc9ac4ef0ca2988d632a59a","4b878931c8e0c5a8ea5e47acd6af10efd1c87d61"],"title":"Coil-helix transition of polypeptide at water-lipid interface.","doi":"10.1088/1742-5468/2015/01/P01034"}

The discrete time-stochastic model for the epidemic evolution is coupled to a set of ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of the expected proportions of subjects in each epidemic state. The unknown parameters are estimated in a Bayesian framework by combining data on the number of new (laboratory confirmed) Ebola cases reported by the Ministry of Health and prior distributions for the transition rates elicited using information collected by the WHO during the follow-up of specific Ebola cases. The time-varying disease transmission rate is modeled in a flexible way using penalized B-splines. Our framework represents a valuable stochastic tool for the study of an epidemic dynamic even when only irregularly observed and possibly aggregated data are available. Simulations and the analysis of the 2014 Sierra Leone Ebola data highlight the merits of the proposed methodology. In particular, the flexible modeling of the disease transmission rate makes the estimation of the effective reproduction number robust to the misspecification of the initial epidemic states and to underreporting of the infectious cases.","inCitations":["ad68590ee873750f03938e8d06f4db0428693028"],"title":"Bayesian inference in an extended SEIR model with nonparametric disease transmission rate: an application to the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw027"}

The developments are partly motivated by computational challenges arising in fitting models of increasing heterogeneity to increasingly large datasets. An example context concerns common biological studies using high-throughput technologies generating many, very large datasets and requiring increasingly high-dimensional mixture models with large numbers of mixture components. We outline important strategies and processes for GPU computation in Bayesian simulation and optimization approaches, give examples of the benefits of GPU implementations in terms of processing speed and scale-up in ability to analyze large datasets, and provide a detailed, tutorial-style exposition that will benefit readers interested in developing GPU-based approaches in other statistical models. Novel, GPU-oriented approaches to modifying existing algorithms software design can lead to vast speed-up and, critically, enable statistical analyses that presently will not be performed due to compute time limitations in traditional computational environments. Supplemental materials are provided with all source code, example data, and details that will enable readers to implement and explore the GPU approach in this mixture modeling context.","inCitations":["d4f2954d120173e9bba86306a5ba3a65b13b8082","99aa6e66b0b8fafe518b489f1423e6703f005f46","1d29c3c646dd2415d1e15362f77be9348c0e3319","15a1cc3fbf62e80adebffc8451d2dac8ef578754","5b95b15652769e25e7ec32052ac4b1b705d6a5b2","3edbd45ba51682fc8efb99e9e4d34b4725c8f256","bebf97f53faf5e2fb4e5d3df2d735a6e279ebfc6","72fcbb83432ba984e42447c28a1e192fde4582f6","46276f53b94f346abff071b024b199c3e55547e3","a1c3e301bfdec367b6c2b3d869e71e3214de7bda","91bf4b8c33498ac4dd05095e5b8c6919e7c3acd1","5e2003732ec1d8e42b1840c32a7a40cc20c1a23b","f6c805eba9ab1fcc41ab36dea814edbac1b06d6b","5a811610dadd75ba3f678e2bab01e746694e04d2","b389b092af388c55c89bf2b2ca434db2f18e37ba","fe40c74cc7ad774e32fff19f34f67db13afd199f","7769836d0cde07acb9e61f3d5dd9a5b7392fbffc","a80f973e0e413225210256beef5ac4bc19be31d8","0c8ffbf47893d241d5a7940b7e3edc2d0ad9d3fe","0b21a4abf1f0463da1f794bd93bb8f0be135d887","e6b5a6d94f418a194edc28fdd259e106596520e6","6344912c29efe6dd6799f6c70fe8202ed2d3b7ca","d296f0c981e6ee00f5cda216b1f856e79949e7f8","8c13a59b545ca799eda3212273e3bb2b2ba8697b","f588e219c98b81615fe22e97ebe3a573430d430d","26fd561a8cf57a0063de82dd0887e6ece3728a22","c62359d8382fc971a301993ad2d30d6cdc909e68","37c6ff5cdb70a50b709acd8d8c44dddddc148573","f809800ba9b81a60a703920e0acdef25da79af61","fe5a398fcccfc802691a0cedb77b9109bda88f16","20c1e6d99af3a0cb3f9eb23a54efe23145d56264","be60146b61a4de6ad6b96ad8a39c86a5521f90d0","36b0c8e97ec40ca35821c3f8b37b02f11bc91314","6c8fe5ffb0cd30ea5d32298302b7ef1e95e66be1","28129778eb41f370a1ac563d9050a1b714202b22","d05d865b5eaf4ad2ff5d168e6907fcf13e95346d","576786771c0a9321f5582fd17268c376dcb47105","3e11f1d421b88c9ed4a9fbd6725baaecee658835","62faec8832cfc61380eda1bc8b85aaab8245586f","54bdba5c8ef4ce12775d554a20c596e37a2fe365","b7798a78c1e3389e2f074bb0804be537e48cdb89","a5c0942287af9457ae058b1e46eda1253b8fae39","fd888904c350d8d4e39050eae9e4265297d84f51","7e320cfe1241eca9a1eb0cd0a44c45b3c8a8d4d5","a92e7d8fc3887186819bb3e4a7c9a19cc9a557a2","3b2f0ca68bbb90b332daa9b053c44f21a468a126","d99cb3dec180a6541bd240845d9ddb1bfca5b12d","d1ee962c7c663380b57d80a7169d6e6710e96418","83a5571d361927873b1442cb32ef441a4b203491","2b1d41e80268b3fcc8bb2b9d9508c7648801fadc","d6437b91ba77b0670109dbd240aea5595af1ff05","f6ddb79aa53601cb85a7be5b1e5cb413963a6dc8","14b868ef2f58b8f6ebf3d20324517a0ba328521d","65bccd10f5e0c31011e9333bbad8105f96ddcd66","ae5d2badcae00667ff56fe1e21d243b84a7407be","a57a07852b82ca8121a5f037cbebe1f7a852e044","d6cf9c6bf88d16c9bc2b35bd2ae87d6437f7212f","156011e66a433bbb0b9bfe3bdf0e79ecca134301","8343250095a99d86069c0bde472613724bf4a4c7","92480b0e0492fcf305769774afa2b514e4a38b02","83ba0844292ac7acaf3df213e9e863e506f68994","e7dae93d9c4419f99d9cd89a9e7ca89facdde815","dae76dc15e6b7d4ca8608f8f568c492d0bc7631f","71ebec1a3e6292a1cf570b97ee8ec3003c3a52fb","601ffdb1725ec44d4702fe58b86c1215b7a4aaad","ef9ccc16122afcf99449bdd7615c6258a1c02ed6","a51b7c2f5c7607d4f1f49c03af283b15ad73c50d","f66eaa74b9e4dc1da9e6864a2ac359e2216ecb0c","944b71dbc3df67f570bd103a437b54ee91fc4e82","47f16fa162dabb027c60c84d7e2d610d761ce88e","9493760628d5dc80a72b0644170618c0993bc9eb","ab282f2326cf5d23024cc8beae5c986db12bb324","ce8d775480b16c56ba913acf6c75ac9168e50525","eafc3b3296997136b3f701a7b135a52fb1a6f397","ca41f34bfc6a5264358abdde40e37e6e6377307b","99f598e1d9fd0adc117cf231236124d71f7a270c","08e7cb1e11375f814558f87e40cb02de7cb40351","009d2108787e2c6e5d93d32a701a0a4f90fc5e36","2494f792e3fe43603a2ddbc8195317fec7bef01d","313a5ca6dc85515d0c1ca875d60ad7c5b4598b2b","a92fba6a41d75855720576e1a693fc88365c0eee","9f92991e4a2f5c6391ff9743d3ab3e6975c4d070","9dbc6c92f5adcd8d4c2ea43b751911399bb7f1e8","1452b3235ba148afc760e59604262200a29675c9","6050da4fe7221d5113ea71f527b800af60df4be3","0a549c09de2698a2b119567d27eee6076ab6f801","809e8e8c2c141cd833b6fce4f7e4964196aecd6b","2f1d036bcd168e42ccc3a86ed662feb08d4c044e","e53ddfc8ca8b52bee2b3389c809bc4ff691b6264","1f1b66e0145be96e5aa3384aa5fd67182dbb65c1","f28b624f98129b455914efd8d467b242e6ef967f","eacfadfa56da63c98e5b5fd7fcc727c7418dc992","00a54c67439730887a7c3cebf0642f1c6b1d7b54","8eead84f54c6db731369c82e5089610f39f9ddc6","c047c23610109d41b2c1ce8ff4dd8e29beafd241","79c232a4971a6a0fb86972285aee209494c06423","2e50c785af300080b840200a175516c8f1c06e3c","b70c37926bc02bf5d9834b2a0640f81bf1517ebd","c85bded731383874669334b7044df9566a94055c","019d49f3234ef3c5a42ed353124edc780819f89e","1061b191369661cf6ae42fb24d12e9c11d7e0932","1a16e09cf14c4146300213db32e07fd74f87d811","5379a8716bc795cc27b0d8c511733370dec4f987","6fe96e7bc981731e0ed71204e3a77e0ef206d8be","ee7dce4e270f49061f27d29408f8f69c28408e2f","660413331e5020750b49f56d30fe130be100e2df","1484ddedda1efe4d29ca0bdd60e89e03b1b16a76","3de5382d846d5f319f466fb2240c6beed3371c2d","bc90ecedff8c93e929aaab39781df7327c9263b0","766c86e927fab2e44926e7ec0044f4cba1bdb905","100123870656318bc7fa1ecb439e90d43eaf7c40","c0c7c7a70ecff794f61dba90102df6408b054bce","8f7d798680faf200b425fd11dfd1f1db2163d075","55a1fb0287127cb7cd0aee3edbf870382f3cf9c4","d2fa69ad5a7513e02e16b958d0eac4643afdc374","6f0ba62fb7f55cd9c17322d738afd

Traditional analyses report usually only the odds ratio for given exposures and the binary disease status. Chain event graphs are a graphical representation of a statistical model derived from event trees which have been developed in artificial intelligence and statistics, and only recently introduced to the epidemiology literature. They are a modern Bayesian technique which enable prior knowledge to be incorporated into the data analysis using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, used to form a suitable chain event graph. Additionally, they can account for missing data and be used to explore missingness mechanisms. Here we adapt the chain event graph framework to suit scenarios often encountered in case-control studies, to strengthen this study design which is time and financially efficient. We demonstrate eight adaptations to the graphs, which consist of two suitable for full case-control study analysis, four which can be used in interim analyses to explore biases, and two which aim to improve the ease and accuracy of analyses. The adaptations are illustrated with complete, reproducible, fully-interpreted examples, including the event tree and chain event graph. Chain event graphs are used here for the first time to summarise non-participation, data collection techniques, data reliability, and disease severity in case-control studies. We demonstrate how these features of a case-control study can be incorporated into the analysis to provide further insight, which can help to identify potential biases and lead to more accurate study results.","inCitations":["d45dd0bfbfef2f28fa5f3a5455c002f66e3890a2"],"title":"Adaptation of Chain Event Graphs for use with Case-Control Studies in Epidemiology","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2016-0073"}

While specific values cannot be assigned to these observations, nevertheless these observed BQL data are informative and generally known to be lower than the lower limit of quantification (LLQ). Setting BQLs as missing data violates the usual missing at random (MAR) assumption applied to the statistical methods, and therefore leads to biased or less precise parameter estimation. By definition, these data lie within the interval [0, LLQ], and can be considered as censored observations. Statistical methods that handle censored data, such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, are thus useful in the modelling of such data sets. The main aim of this work was to investigate the impact of the amount of BQL observations on the bias and precision of parameter estimates in population PK models (non-linear mixed effects models in general) under maximum likelihood method as implemented in SAS and NONMEM, and a Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as applied in WinBUGS. A second aim was to compare these different methods in dealing with BQL or censored data in a practical situation. The evaluation was illustrated by simulation based on a simple PK model, where a number of data sets were simulated from a one-compartment first-order elimination PK model. Several quantification limits were applied to each of the simulated data to generate data sets with certain amounts of BQL data. The average percentage of BQL ranged from 25% to 75%. Their influence on the bias and precision of all population PK model parameters such as clearance and volume distribution under each estimation approach was explored and compared.","inCitations":["03e30fc47239f21686d78d77cc090b8c374157a1","284f8bca3a9fad77040447f3411f087cb18ee4bb","52511678e9e99529a19406546d4cc08407859ada","cfccfbe4491da4471d034182ab84f0095c2a8f04","1646499b3eb76769cd5a6670ca59527c31dd4a46","2038e763f9a2aa51d16d0b11477fabe27aa343fa","70048123fbeff709212e59371b2bcfd19ffd2923","37209a92f0077298d6d1c3b192c4cac36cc80279","f464926757db64972a4732795b7cbbf39a8c7b4d","56fd618bb729efdc665fb42c55c131baf1ae96ce"],"title":"Evaluations of Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods in PK models with below-quantification-limit data.","doi":"10.1002/pst.400"}

Previously we modeled feline hematopoiesis using a two-compartment hidden Markov process that had birth and emigration events in the first compartment. Here we perform Bayesian statistical inference on models which contain two additional events in the first compartment in order to determine if HSC fate decisions are linked to cell division or occur independently. Pareto Optimal Model Assessment approach is used to cross check the estimates from Bayesian inference. Our results show that HSC must divide symmetrically (i.e., produce two HSC daughter cells) in order to maintain hematopoiesis. We then demonstrate that the augmented model that adds asymmetric division events provides a better fit to the competitive transplantation data, and we thus provide evidence that HSC fate determination in vivo occurs both in association with cell division and at a separate point in time. Last we show that assuming each cat has a unique set of parameters leads to either a significant decrease or a nonsignificant increase in model fit, suggesting that the kinetic parameters for HSC are not unique attributes of individual animals, but shared within a species.","inCitations":["47e3031cec5cc775cf816429c0b00dd8825b5c93","bb0168f887e743bd91c6b0c991e17b45211ce8d0","256f7c4520f826c0cb6a669871db5fd1c978cd7f","2f79544c74c92147b6d4d2d30294bf3ffe09be3d","3901ac3c020e3fb2d228d1b0f8e5d5d338778e40","ded59dcfde4b06294e237f1b806ea038004a2506","29483c9f8190e4987ed4c2cffd8af68e4534fd4c"],"title":"Bayesian Inference and Model Choice in a Hidden Stochastic Two-compartment Model of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Fate Decisions.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS269"}

This phenomenon is called heaping, and the error inherent in heaped self-reported numbers can bias estimation. Heaped data may be collected cross-sectionally or longitudinally and there may be covariates that complicate the inferential task. Heaping is a well-known issue in many survey settings, and inference for heaped data is an important statistical problem. We propose a novel reporting distribution whose underlying parameters are readily interpretable as rates of misremembering and rounding. The process accommodates a variety of heaping grids and allows for quasi-heaping to values nearly but not equal to heaping multiples. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model for longitudinal samples with covariates to infer both the unobserved true distribution of counts and the parameters that control the heaping process. Finally, we apply our methods to longitudinal self-reported counts of sex partners in a study of high-risk behavior in HIV-positive youth.","inCitations":["176a223337b6d466fb7ac373dc76e18d480c51e8","606e3b0f78a37fe008f3aad40732da55333a9b2a","625b2a2a8dae87b5a1d7355a6413b7297dc7f68e","3269845990717a8b4510df8053754faeceb50bb8"],"title":"Sex, Lies and Self-reported Counts: Bayesian Mixture Models for Heaping in Longitudinal Count Data via Birth-death Processes.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS809"}

When the approach is applied to the linear regression model, the result provides information concerning the data structure different from that contributed by Cook's distance. One of the main advantages of the local influence approach is its ability to handle the simultaneous effect of several cases, namely, the ability to address the problem of 'masking'. However, Lawrance (1995) points out that there are two notions of 'masking' effects, the joint influence and the conditional influence, which are distinct in nature. The normal curvature and the direction of maximum curvature are capable of addressing effects under the category of joint influences but not conditional influences. We construct a new measure to define and detect conditional local influences and use the linear regression model for illustration. Several reported data sets are used to demonstrate that new information can be revealed by this proposed measure.","inCitations":["67994fc9712605e8dd4ff305b0695f4c8db53d1b","4497284c07f5c03287fd6e132ea7f45681d3d344","a59d61af43cd52b46835fac767c58c6c5442337e"],"title":"Conditional local influence in case-weights linear regression.","doi":"10.1348/000711001159375"}

This paper examines the distributional properties of the standardized mean change, and discusses potential problems with the variance formulae given in Becker (1988). First, an error in the exact variance formula can lead to severe underestimation of the actual sampling variance. Second, Becker (1988) recommended the use of an approximation which is shown to underestimate the sampling variance when sample size is small. Using the approximation can decrease the accuracy of meta-analysis results; however, the degree of error is generally small.","inCitations":["aef02c10e1fc9f47deb5fd17ca3a83b3b5f1ef3c","634293f80f8e661dc259e4902bca99821bec3014","1cc2da8a1ea0dec594770b784748033aef6725d1","06c34ed878f059ce891417855190fcb86d3a0dac","7356a493ac0a1e5ac883b015e440471ef873dc8c","23d951268f52d8cc99853cd50498120138813201","f607dd7e58c5f556b36f525f9ce05e47b2b82af7","c05278b433ec4e610518e645367309ee4c53acdd","c1c8a0d63a0444023cc2e05e03ba5b2ba83f355a","4fad411d179c86fbda584e1faf1a9c399a5f1ba0","0e797e245bf7c6ec7cd5b37137fdf3c9b3970266","bbd4dd6df08de9928be250ff74a2e11e2eb35401","12caa0cefd2360b8cc32c94a74229f33320a1ddb","85988db2a9e954bf0a621efa6547c3312e856e6d","e2c32b5547790f553c69fa42d4ac83ce6aae791f","aaf0f92664356e1978ef33d1b3789d4936d6293e","bb86ce993b5166c48c60e1951aeac6c11b5de4e6","752926970b1ca95a6a91f6c149894afc4d378d21","c00b29fac6f89577e23b0ef52446137869ce7828","cca2473552ec513d11e172ada90a1155808f09bf","ae1475017952e7ef7f584f6a5d7ab14d6322ca14","33f3bfb921d2ed5f48ff42717b5568fd88617134","feab9a3bd5553302305f583cd4253c88ed541ed8","0c1c9b2f53e75c8638e10c94518d548561efa6ec","4c4ef9dc08520f00fb4cf5b6ac7459b5fc802604","b08025b407f427f041f894c5e5c73fb2f2d789d5","d88e7804b7df89d229fd5db7a1c567b94ff18f33","3e20f2d9cb836df231806fb825e6f0eccde81559","67dd8496b258f48ee3d2ce0761913bd2a6a9720f","20f4e21b6e88e21d03deff29170e62807a6751c1","6b35c96e62c7fd84336b6f0f864f92053881c3dd","6daf5c7bf7c7c33a3d8bca58aba3bc307f912a76","7b155213b764233c096d4482cff636124a5f4c30","667d82317faea8290298d4c1334799fefccd1edf","5d3884c591b6bd9e8b45b948538aaf6937730dd6","a167ff141e3abbe78631f39e7214af6bc7e426a8","f868850b98af11c2a2c42b38fc15f59e72df2304","f9a184c612aafae678c9aa810730457a6895e26a","f19e82952efd3ee868be8a9ac96e58bff1957590","fdde329bbb324a18fd4e8bb4305ad566758df284","039c3d761ae167f38223b43375b03616f4833010","52ad3966353ccd084b8bd61ff9488acf9170be14","c7c0123a561bd202eb1074948820f466c5fe382b","0a295fbb74d7d604a4de546dd810f1663863449e","4aa2097461cf25320632c2f576a1c906c1c815ac","f7efdb40a44ae2c9f04f2314e2c29dcb1705e419","1ea2a8cad596b7019d55e60cf93f05b342b8124f","9c9c2ae20fa97d56021001c39ebc863d14ffdb50","6c548ab197d53f4dd28ed5f25a32415407ac45be","9f58274d9f89a23c41fad7276d14f93628fb9af4","976137cf809e1c0da5f1e1ade97aaceaadefc166","143b3ae2fbbe21bc65fa7b2be12e49581605e652","3df182c4f50bef440520530f6a56c4c5ddeb2bb3","afee8cbe87bb891da4deb3a87dae60bdd501ddd5","c35853998392e8b5ba84cbd29d858629395624a8","0ea0144f92f67f5872f7f0408e448a5d2aed6849","9abf6adaca38f4cf73a78b2543aae3d34d5a0722","16929b49a4b7feb2b8d190ae5f6f5e691bc1adb0","c548187cd505d27ab672abfec73d32960255efab","739065d7c4da1e8efc50b0df2fe1f0241aa7c52e","f1515fe3da8053b74fe08743eaadc7c4035be80d","44cfbc18befbe7d845cbd3ad36f6b28783d227ea","c9d3a99145a40d28b4e5480a21fbe95a79c93273","c4ee73169412595f79e04f0b897366a6af9734bf","0df070ea65737b34a0be0af8980b308ce3bf37be","f0623bf555054bcc36cf42c4c0c418933393ff3f","7281e855668afc6365f9aba0c8a31139396a6085","49e920e09e38e46779804658e805d9859500c61a","c77ca3aeed52c27ea81ce1548963842450838774","579f37474de1586954d4c7134d21ff0e9fdf24f9","0cdfcd09dbd53e597a7bea421adb8c9a3fa34bfa","a05047ffb883bd42a1b85f28c08f1fe46cca9f89","f3d3bff16524b56366e866c32f7c159752402d90","ce4b56b6ae6b3d6d5eec26d4d7b93edcbb6827ed","dcf30ee63b66afc6355e2af47e5555a468525fda","2e9cf3b43a8083bdbf5c3f14b063e9a0f625bcda"],"title":"Distribution of the standardized mean change effect size for meta-analysis on repeated measures.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159150"}

Analyses are performed using the FO and FOCE method implemented in the NONMEM software. We compare several approaches for model selection based on tests and global criteria. We illustrate the results with pharmacokinetic data on indinavir from HIV-positive patients included in COPHAR 2-ANRS 111 to study the gene effect prospectively. Only the tests based on the EBE obtain an empirical type I error close to the expected 5%. The approximation made with the FO algorithm results in a significant inflation of the type I error of the LRT and Wald tests.","inCitations":["192a4f1a271b33f01107cbd601401b11aeed4e38","e1dd70cc22e74e6c63307452c4021a7a5f544b50","7d4d6c0571d59c451321d61b037a438ee90d3e0f","46de44988d9c0b24f6d3fd7010e582a99b0ad026","68b60b1baf69d5c394b00f9e79deb337342a41d5","e7901f2e1aa720b2d8fbd88a21ca20298a8961f0","12574fd8453e78d09256a3117d13f439fc1ef2db","198e827b63111a8468937e3774828dd4102a6469","dbc96c4b0e27e5d42a86572a40b0aa4ea50f8de9","f9b8f0f97202a1a8cd226b39f7aeff451fcfb6a0","63b944ef922f6e66801d55f43008a1b5506fa295","6b2418f991147a54b935e4d1ee3efe9a48564a84","538c6059185bcad96a71fa6b0ceb3f80aba4e444","ed245ab3ae93594f57abdaa146c1beb68c1b32e1","aa173a8984b21e26ef1c95bcdf7710fed6019f75","d87b6a657ea101dd380eb61ea45beeade9e4e5fc","cb08b223f9146ed4b6cf44b5cd55a530e3bc79e8","d67e6c5f4c312f293394c8d6f1c2991f27bd48f2","469e2f456d44a1b45c9b479973070b99ea580943","ff285396414ee1283ae4758cc1ca48bacdaaa663","ce2c892fdf2e31519f75eb4c609c73b7d5f6eae2","151371c92018fad805f3507c57d675b7228c19f9","f649a184bfaeda6542e2b6ee30d993a46c36f303","1708497d7c3e01115ab1feaa1b3ba254c5f41401","7ce2cb89f38f33a5ada1207b31d48afb7ce535c5","b7146b399907569dc418bee9bf2116b1b75a80e9","99eb49b348363be68e66924bc098d1902f513527","27d143ea35c3c1c1a1bc8f213a3d578b5121b7fa","d1f7c27bc99cb7922274f29e7e735bdcddd3d205"],"title":"Comparison of model-based tests and selection strategies to detect genetic polymorphisms influencing pharmacokinetic parameters.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802369012"}

Rather than focusing on the regression coefficients, the purpose of these models is inference about the mean of the outcome as a function of a set of covariates, and various functionals of the mean function used to measure the effects of the covariates. A commonly used functional in econometrics, referred to as the marginal effect, is the partial derivative of the mean function with respect to any covariate, averaged over the empirical distribution of covariates in the model. We define an analogous parameter for discrete covariates. The proposed estimation method not only helps to identify an appropriate link function and to suggest an underlying distribution for a specific application but also serves as a robust estimator when no specific distribution for the outcome measure can be identified. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the resulting parameter estimators are consistent. The method is illustrated with an analysis of inpatient expenditure data from a study of hospitalists.","inCitations":["c1fed13c9a40564e537187bf5f85013d75432f06","cf004c464249e4f2b7f63712581b132da0420c5e","2a5e6dfa3e6185641bfc78378a6c56c73c1be7d8","6dbd87544e2bab16110cfdd7e00d61b6b3b0a94c","118207498b3f52a862f416c787208c943d77c979","f1378f67ce58afdc3e4209df4004e36a8a5f67c2","73a856b7f9f4e8dca261508d40cef13110cea163","f2a6f095680d38dbddf3153ac303add6e890dc2d","49dc739426379547c96829f211c2aa56783fb88f","2191a185ea7bafadb6d9595caaeb57889c1ce9be","61df6cdec8b0d95395a62edea7c9714515aafb30","0c6b10c46d3a3dbc61e23a6274ac71408b578beb","1a566f5568ff4c64bfdab23c5e703acbf8fa867c","2b5a0495a887dc1c7046042b2f1ec547bfa88229","aaeb30446f8cbcd74682c0fb14ab22c2d9cf287d","8d0b962ea7245ada5eabed077dba5a09cc9045cb","54d0631b2430f74fad7106b06717f93afea8ea19","7fb1a1f3691313be6633bd7d83c7b20520a14baa","e3b5dddaae2bfc66aeced68368b5c173be3c41f4","e6b16735c56d2d5af5b50b9065e89d62ee786fb1","db530ba4a3404cf5f46e0e5549781cf5e2bccfcb","0b0434c6be0c5007216b7e43b99487a544cf2093","33f2906aaed35fcf54af9d373a5d638e0ff3cdd1","c5e549ab43f8f15b8f55a4739ef3be95267c8758","9584582de454cb465dd60ce77023a73ab0c1fa6f","a2b3df7113dde11657e40368a210cada68f683a9","1300a5fb797d7b66b2acd49e195d8429e3f68ba7","d6e73fd05b74a924081847cc154d26b2c7e857fb","e64ec31a6301fcbbc9da418b4dfff86384a4c507","196c94c515477f33fd40649a5210149ee007f702","ce60e6add12f4e97659b25ec4a9366d931a09058","f26ebeeaf898a1d52921d0489c4e58acc8f3e291","80023b6e21c48a03a8b403c81e47764c3a6db35f","94f1722c477d1c2aeff1ada97c679ae1defe3711","953f8f8daef065b5adebae14f7ed63f035136640","4a3d323eaf11a8755a28f2b3cee0219314cbc161","9f13cad73d66eae3f837f259c65ac9dd80a8aa16","dd1144ee5170ec10d7f1f1d3b65962a49318a24d","f5e212b420be9adcebd2038d07186ce6ea6cbf88","7b75926b42a8205a73847f1449128ed406517498","ca6b81cc87962e8a521218e39ef17a14f64aed75","1c82243ec16c060d970d196340c4e769db690b67","d3295ce5796166f8d5a1eddf20e1f7d9cc22ed77","d3e27ea531a7468e9daa7a43240db751a3ddc864","734ef1fe788bcf2acd8cb2a0508777396539bbf0","8c11bd96d4eacd2291ff923180ae31e4d6ed47e9","12dd165624a809b14b8a0c37144309b528b1d0f9","097d7759b1eba03c84a4fbdf83142e29578f1f96","ffe8a1cdd61a61c56d51e8ed53f5b2e14e7e7302","2b38913cf673f2250c8820827dd7d983dc755e67","17fc997d0896f57f9f86db2f2acf88a873dcf6c9","f03a8389e9328d614661a1afaa571a2370885ad6","35665465e50a36362510cd0f79df977188d6b5ac","2bf7c879eb05b4ea35b460950571406fbec0c8e8","3e324850df1c008ac672dc43324f6eca8afda6d8","35c302bb846df760e276e05f08cfe314daa4f722","3a52f668d53ba01d1647832cf93e666e58dd053d","4450b963edf5b87e9c1044c13ba93e6b8d6d775e","59607221ad6c3c31226ca5fc9b3998b0c32a0378","0629e92700e98d1bec99be4bf626d4cde7ba9a1c","69150ddf40d53a8e9204766c53767953b32178bb","a2fc5b362b2814867570b566f4e9fa50ad0ca098","45ec335f06ca4feedbb8a59fbe9230dfb8ff3a9c","407d92fd7fdb2d678ea1eb59b993db568f944e57","2d4ff9420b8dabf87b6acb128b922c18a4dce4a4","60436952f3fb162f9c57252542f055b590508cbb","ab19354ce38c8eb5503bd17bb4fc5a9343fc05a5","430415b1a7e5278c9c8e85e051e9c1af9413db2c","87b2af271bcffaa09f057a1645a3d9e9d3c6a7a0","4c7c645d41029c33e4c9078a9c5f7414bdb16211","895f9c641a461c89438365f6bb99f735f95182c9","5fb00651298b061cf98183463b5894e76445db67","d23bbb4a226d32e25527875c0a123e021e417ba2","22575c29318edcf3198c9720a8f791c3da92d089","8c9ea9062f761e0800443925d43c7414db3a7974","863e27425fc0e115e2edc81e36a6d904b8214434","6f9c2796ddb552fb18d6d195d6b419186545a069","cb786f9fab8593b40e561960c4eb0f3515beb07f","82e48d30a64cb64cb8e71bf5336b5dc5040d6c0a","11b9dba0f3546fe2e887b2519ded2a7f0812b746","6ed5ed4aa8adaba6ebc9befbad7556ab8db8434b","05108a66c8a061f1e6263820dbdc877d6bad3050","b824d4598b6f9611dfa9b40860bdd5e119119342","5db89e6ff821d716c656a94c52a1d9f18a4f92e3","bcc853562b26989bd71d61b28d1e41f15bc50ab6","4dfbb5bc98e9c68d5651fb9d031367303c2eafef","b0cdebd8fa2c1175b543506dd2cadefb64f75f29","49c0c32726029d98f69fa26b9420fa8199810338","6e0589ad1427221b01d30e015e3d6a956bfb6035","3ffe944df451b22c7f342673a56eec7596864637","de930a12a9ca997c5bd7829fcabd379586f14313","63582da660ae46df6bd576674cf375a5905272dd","bbcac3709ccfad747cb26f33d9a412c18d756999","3577cff1c4e2cbc01ceec583ddde9a33ac6d24bb","dc2e20609c391244fe0117b80e4afa9e4e54a4ac","4fa153c4539dce3687c971a407a6a3d4d6e2ee12","8f9948fd07a67ec4adcc31e86adb82d0b1092d16","78860bb674516e001bd6cba9fb7a8dda5339803a","ea4d998ccfe08fa204d45830ad255e462b2afa58","714316f7032e4bbf4a1df3383e9e5d0367a7e767","0e1a4eaaa39054255c01934dbfbd1cf049e4d4e9","9fea995fba3a208afdcb7267ef10d925f5d3412f","70f3f96fb9cc77784013b4abcfef2d5c53884732","6d28e7a5e4355fdf01cdcedfe5b2f416179b8000","6c6e58cd129551217dfb9d9a82ecd6d846b70f33","4d8973113c9989e8f210a75a1bd3e0c84f309989","5df979b54d0bdfa9730515a8d50ba8522dbdcda3","02ad50f27fb334d3e812d83a01232f26bc810c99","1192c723200483ea411967fe049dd33fc00f4dae","ccd32c7fb5287b87e3e80abc539119be64bb72bb","ff3102383d9fc7c6e9f1e30b3f983305ef2d4ab2","a2e395bba64495ccd4f38ba27aa890f652cc51f2","d4c9fb2dfd43100d982efc4623a4eb294eb9e8ef","852471a2ae1e160e5d478fe791eae747946d3f95","8423e80e095a9155506626c23f402fdf575c0b1b","9a0948fba6bfea96bde0d599

At present, the most widely used method in network meta-analysis is contrast-based, in which a baseline treatment needs to be specified in each study, and the analysis focuses on modeling relative treatment effects (typically log odds ratios). However, population-averaged treatment-specific parameters, such as absolute risks, cannot be estimated by this method without an external data source or a separate model for a reference treatment. Recently, an arm-based network meta-analysis method has been proposed, and the R package pcnetmeta provides user-friendly functions for its implementation. This package estimates both absolute and relative effects, and can handle binary, continuous, and count outcomes.","inCitations":["fad8fb3af03f80773cde04506a5b5742292aa853","c6ceb8189bdef0b846a42be9cd65f5e7de4e5d42","492884dcb57c8330b965b9eba98160c09319e434","512ef99cce2ff6f449736cce06f468cf762d9446","3ecaac1acd32bbcb7ca71bad552e7be1bf73007b","29a739bd91be64743e6413d5181ab4d446faa936","a328cd891a0d75adcf46d7a8f78d84e946507143","c5bb63ef355095a2d38f0a7a0818972e70390cd5","61a37dfb4b134a53b37f2f75bfac2bf893e993af","cf859dce1e84111ec594b14d6f4edc0e665e8737"],"title":"Performing Arm-Based Network Meta-Analysis in R with the pcnetmeta Package.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v080.i05"}

Assessing the adequacy of these models is an important task because model misspecification affects the validity of inference and the accuracy of prediction. In this paper, we introduce appropriate time-dependent residuals for these models and consider the cumulative sums of the residuals. Under the assumed model, the cumulative sum processes converge weakly to zero-mean Gaussian processes whose distributions can be approximated through Monte Carlo simulation. These results enable one to assess, both graphically and numerically, how unusual the observed residual patterns are in reference to their null distributions. The residual patterns can also be used to determine the nature of model misspecification. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well in practical situations. Three medical studies are provided for illustrations.","inCitations":["d39255f772f202a6943c4c67435bcbc81f21c3ff","ba048c6117f99f30d86f35760807456db092e9f4","ffa0fe0d726ed168fec98196e376059726c69bea","45d1b7b72b9ccd77a8c2c0cc2f39f9e30492dac0","b7f58537b878a487201bfe2213a2b5cfc8b13792","bdc7b086051f7011f0407a5be9536d279563fab7","062a599b8aed80f18d2e61aad2b505ebfdb6eb89","92dd2b2f3516d275f81d3375d3e639b7bd2880a4","2e723af736f7b00c963f0e3fc09865a20d03d5f9"],"title":"Checking semiparametric transformation models with censored data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr017"}

To address the computational needs of genome wide association (GWA) studies, a fast Java application, which combines single-locus SNP tests and a scan statistic for identifying chromosomal regions with significant clusters of significant SNP effects, was developed and implemented. To illustrate this application, SNP associations were analyzed in a pharmacogenomic study of the blood pressure lowering effect of thiazide-diuretics (N=195) using the Affymetrix Human Mapping 100K Set. 55,335 tagSNPs (pair-wise linkage disequilibrium R(2)<0.5) were selected to reduce the frequency correlation between SNPs. A typical workstation can complete the whole genome scan including 10,000 permutation tests within 3 hours. The most significant regions locate on chromosome 3, 6, 13 and 16, two of which contain candidate genes that may be involved in the underlying drug response mechanism. The computational performance of ChromoScan-GWA and its scalability were tested with up to 1,000,000 SNPs and up to 4,000 subjects. Using 10,000 permutations, the computation time grew linearly in these datasets. This scan statistic application provides a robust statistical and computational foundation for identifying genomic regions associated with disease and provides a method to compare GWA results even across different platforms.","inCitations":["411e62888e48ee7e8b638b15c066d613a9c1b75c","87d617d34b77f20a72e7b34a64ade400cbe15298","4cb7b812530b2c2f999132b449cc67c19b850125","9339111f4c1f4df1230d7e866e7df9b1d05dd02c","82fb9c0669535a43ee03b3198f870c5e195be611","6320e25009803b39f5a800b57f9f6e8bd0f45b1f","24d1d745c97cb69fcb3be92786d94334fff753a8"],"title":"Fast implementation of a scan statistic for identifying chromosomal patterns of genome wide association studies","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.04.013"}

BE studies are commonly two-period crossovers, but may also use replicated designs. The replicated crossover will provide greater power for the ABE assessment. FDA has recommended that ABE analysis of replicated crossovers use a model which includes terms for separate within- and between-subject components for each formulation and which allows for a subject x formulation interaction component. Our simulation study compares the performance of four alternative mixed effects models: the FDA model, a three variance component model proposed by Ekbohm and Melander (EM), a random intercepts and slopes model (RIS) proposed by Patterson and Jones, and a simple model that contains only two variance components. The simple model fails (when not 'true') to provide adequate coverage and it accepts the hypothesis of equivalence too often. FDA and EM models are frequently indistinguishable and often provide the best performance with respect to coverage and probability of concluding BE. The RIS model concludes equivalence too often when both the within- and between-subject variance components differ between formulations. The FDA analysis model is recommended because it provides the most detail regarding components of variability and has a slight advantage over the EM model in confidence interval length.","inCitations":["d12d980ab30453ce19910cd69d743ea9592f3ca8","010020317a8c12254e7ac1bae4030f1e2439ce72","27fd8719473c1e2206592d2ff4c9ee4e5b34e557","8f5151966d00f70da9227508f9b1d2eb2fbdaaa7","9bc4d7574d7be3124039603635b2f82604427c2a","59e7100280c2172349368dd39272e47ee652e9f7"],"title":"Comparison of models for average bioequivalence in replicated crossover designs.","doi":"10.1002/pst.212"}

Further, we investigate how to harness the massive thread-parallelization capabilities of graphical processing units to accelerate computation. The computational advantages of our algorithms are demonstrated with various simulated data examples in which we compare our stochastic search with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in moderate dimensional data examples. These experiments show that our stochastic search largely outperforms the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in terms of computing-times and in terms of the quality of the posterior mode discovered.
