Here we explore a dataset where second order interactions lead unavoidably to high order interactions. However in certain cases these interactions have a simple form which can be explained by population heterogeneity or 'frailty' and the Rasch model which uses a logistic structure is one such model. However its parameters are difficult to interpret. When event probabilities are low, we develop a simple model based on a multiplicative structure and a one-parameter gamma frailty model is developed to accommodate this sort of data. Moment estimators estimates are also provided for more general cases and goodness of fit statistics are given.

A titer estimation method is needed for large scale data generated by OPA, and it is one component of OPA standardization. In order to improve the reliability of OPA results, we developed a nonlinear fitting method using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with an option of a robust procedure to estimate titers of OPA data. Performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing precision and accuracy of titer estimation with traditional methods used in the literature by analyzing real experimental data sets. Goodness-of-fit to experimental data for the two model-based methods was also assessed. We conclude that the four-parameter logistic model is an alternative choice for titer estimation of OPA data. Computer software using the statistical language R and Microsoft Excel was developed to implement our calculation algorithm for OPA data.","inCitations":["7d29f705c2324d6ab1c6301b6b614bfa03615fb0","e200602fcf3f65f8299810e839d4ad05da23aa8d","b155626b9b674940ef3532834de11f5a8869c168","088b86e17a0bce545251cf2a29fdae53a25c0fd4","cf68bb1e6e3e5f58f41d4803d5688e266e80045d","e1070df595e8f1a29c528aef1a964273aa1469dd","8b56f458369f780da2e349550e6f90ec195390d7","5e49c12f1da29ae34dc7375cc8d534b9b9ad71d5"],"title":"A four-parameter logistic model for estimating titers of functional multiplexed pneumococcal opsonophagocytic killing assay.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701697182"}

In practice, the fitting algorithm can fail to converge due to boundary issues of the estimated random-effects covariance matrix G, i.e., being near-singular, non-positive definite, or both. Current available algorithms are not computationally optimal because the condition number of matrix G is unnecessarily increased when the random-effects correlation estimate is not zero. We propose an adaptive fitting (AF) algorithm using an optimal linear transformation of the random-effects design matrix. It is a data-driven adaptive procedure, aiming at reducing subsequent random-effects correlation estimates down to zero in the optimal transformed estimation space. Simulations show that AF significantly improves the convergent properties, especially under small sample size, relative large noise and high correlation settings. One real data for Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF) protein is used to illustrate the application of this algorithm implemented with software package R (nlme).","inCitations":["07d72251764d3447e384feea0ee0d03f1dc58e02","5723db8009f7dd4a0f84133e6e0d7bddcf1c063d"],"title":"Adaptive Fitting of Linear Mixed-Effects Models with Correlated Random-effects.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2012.690763"}

The goal is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) after possible modification of the dose range during the trial. Parametric models are used to describe the relationship between the dose and the probability of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). We investigate model reparameterization in terms of the probabilities of DLT at the minimum and maximum available doses at the start of the trial. Trial design proceeds using escalation with overdose control (EWOC), where at each stage of the trial we seek the dose of the agent such that the posterior probability of exceeding the MTD of this agent is bounded by a feasibility bound. At any time during the trial, we test whether the MTD is below or above the minimum and maximum doses, respectively. If during the trial there is evidence that the MTD is outside the range of doses, we extend the range of doses and complete the trial with the planned sample size. At the end of the trial, a Bayes estimate of the MTD is proposed. We evaluate design operating characteristics in terms of safety of the trial design and efficiency of the MTD estimate under various scenarios and model misspecification. The methodology is further compared to the original EWOC design. We showed by comprehensive simulation studies that the proposed method is safe and can estimate the MTD more efficiently than the original EWOC design.","inCitations":["6b478146a1b8e4fe2474d69d278fdae5564cf0ec","34228138d5d5acefceb1c5fd4d31e8b92b2754da"],"title":"A Bayesian adaptive design for cancer phase I trials using a flexible range of doses.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1372774"}

In practice, however, this goal is hardly ever met, with different time intervals between assessment waves and different time intervals between individuals being more the rule than the exception. One of the reasons for the introduction of continuous time models by means of structural equation modelling has been to deal with irregularly spaced assessment waves (e.g., Oud & Delsing, 2010). In the present paper we extend the approach to individually varying time intervals for oscillating and non-oscillating processes. In addition, we show not only that equal intervals are unnecessary but also that it can be advantageous to use unequal sampling intervals, in particular when the sampling rate is low. Two examples are provided to support our arguments. In the first example we compare a continuous time model of a bivariate coupled process with varying time intervals to a standard discrete time model to illustrate the importance of accounting for the exact time intervals. In the second example the effect of different sampling intervals on estimating a damped linear oscillator is investigated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. We conclude that it is important to account for individually varying time intervals, and encourage researchers to conceive of longitudinal studies with different time intervals within and between individuals as an opportunity rather than a problem.","inCitations":["81ca002523fdb85fc9dbd1b9cef338b39ee3a6ad","9e7e8d4ff908fe2234c1b0931b4780840a9a3812","db725ed493eb2558e0d96aa21c70bef1033e194d","e25b156b9041d6a59b7e3bf93e5bc828570e48f7","39b7f9d76789a1436447957bd62eca179036e188","108ad31987f0e02b20983127fe10a1d155223a81","8c7b97b0325d73a9e176de2c9c3058618608ffe6","3d5839dbcf31209263bb31af5cdb7677d0af795b","46488e675dc7d7632f3a2a1c76514f90dc9fe170","5fbef98118db8223af511fa310ea11b8bd5c0c80","5d2982d80c8311bd9332256a6275bd4d9ec9ea4e","122641d4b90b33f7de8ee61568172e5b9f3bca4b","32a2d9cc8fe3a88d1b37dbd55512a3c87c459b01","3703f2f904773c12a51fa4d5780f44573ec26784","afc4e1e009952c24ff9a3c61f6df234b47bed662","ad4f6499eb96e8a5477d75af626ed7c467fe752e","29641dca630fea3e6830a3a85a135e1ed946100c","fc0c0ec03fed479e08e05adfab0f1d29a1d916eb","3aa042becbcb36b5c9bd0b7b1103f7958c9e6d92","7cb727878d5e9797fe54585b3aba6adb6a18b9fc","a53e85573e4b765bb3db1ff8c425ed2e0f7323d2","305a301d17f2f3eb40de1ade56ac1ae9f385b5c2","bc063a5b9e7da562f61498f082147a2c3a3de8b7","5fbb6ed80963f53f1192e54fda838ffdc77f0fc6","d4dfd30e3283950a3fe489225e5a9eac9dc59e0d"],"title":"Continuous time modelling with individually varying time intervals for oscillating and non-oscillating processes.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02043.x"}

These studies might occur early in a drug development process, where the aim might be to demonstrate a basic level of proof (the so-called proof of concept (PoC) studies), at a later stage, to help establish a dose or doses that should be used in phase III trials (dose-finding), or even in confirmatory studies, where the registration of several doses might be considered. When a small number of doses are examined, the ability to implement parametric modeling is somewhat limited. As an alternative, in this paper, a flexible Bayesian model is suggested. In particular, we draw on the idea of using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to exploit an assumed monotonic dose-response relationship, without using strong parametric assumptions. The approach is exemplified by assessing operating characteristics in the design of a PoC study examining a new treatment for psoriatic arthritis and a post hoc data analysis involving three confirmatory clinical trials, which examined an adjunctive treatment for partial epilepsy. Key difficulties, such as prior specification and computation, are discussed. A further extension, based on combining the flexible modeling with a classical multiple comparisons procedure, known as MCP-MOD, is examined. The benefit of this extension is a potential reduction in the number of simulations that might be needed to investigate operating characteristics of the statistical analysis.","inCitations":["df143087dff1b8b1948c6696b514c6be4031072e"],"title":"A flexible Bayesian approach for modeling monotonic dose-response relationships in drug development trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.919931"}

It allows for a test of an overall effect, as well as for tests of effects of study characteristics, that is, (discrete or continuous) moderator effects. We describe various procedures to test moderator effects: the z, t, likelihood ratio (LR), Bartlett-corrected LR (BcLR), and resampling tests. We compare the Type I error of these tests, and conclude that the common z test, and to a lesser extent the LR test, do not perform well since they may yield Type I error rates appreciably larger than the chosen alpha. The error rate of the resampling test is accurate, closely followed by the BcLR test. The error rate of the t test is less accurate but arguably tolerable. With respect to statistical power, the BcLR and t tests slightly outperform the resampling test. Therefore, our recommendation is to use either the resampling or the BcLR test. If these statistics are unavailable, then the t test should be used since it is certainly superior to the z test.","inCitations":["c80c9370a0e0081ec1f6e2285166fac448d72c29","5f594718791fffa261e62bfe89778f642461fe39","3d13344d74b8f976785cabad3eb8f1d2099dc499","ed38c066ecbbb49e99d5ecb487c4d8fe6d623e54","26fe72e62788c570044d90542ae4785dc22b5583","32077430cb30f8feb31b2b2ec31a1d5105af5b04","4104db6d21033ba534a4c0475f42d483740cb5f3","fde6d9ae4b717f4615421700497fc64eeb8267f4","798099d31206828c52fa502d679116f2beb19dfc","87baadbac538d6bcd42b166d4ba97281628a42c4","47f7b833e14427a2b3be19c6c25db0612176fac5","d8f711c1a9226cb2249beb86a0a2d8adbaee0a20","5e8027eeaf9db72735e5f96d93b2eb162758176f","a91f5676ce6763effe5003d5093632a6fcca5974","1921e8b9c791fdc538661184dbec1fa68d70d2b3","12ab0156dd67c6e6e149b7722c0cf7c2a2474ce7","48f2d8a8bbfcb4679c8253e7347fccd164dee531","442856dcdaec18b0ebdc16919227cc9ed33b4151","62bd78a531bdc6e8ca5eee5d381e6611efb6f5b9","cec4b527a19b48b0489cea0c60da86593895a0c6","4f5c6d42814ddb0ae726637b1d38576d91d7a082","8df4e5f0daf0c3e643fc228f680ded3cb35ddb9c","8298adc218c15c458ae3886eb36f784d9b766789","59de355f3b008cb3f42a032ffdef3ed985f37aa7","2cca3179c720270fb57e0ba1b8444a156a20cbb0","0674a5978f5c7bfc9d0105f66a4c699ce7cf2a71","76f878e662dff4d59870a8fb07ab2bc028db921d","81da07f435be28cc84cc723987366409f2da21f7","f05424c4c96f89df5fb8132c97c9ff73fb3e27f2","1427c37c172f1d58df53c90fb51a8b1d80a9443e","0490dd4de1acde8025ecdab2ece4a5458f293263","73536a9868502d266a9cca6c56540a58d3771fc5","2060b8bfb6197ea56073887c7176a34fa648f5d7","1ce5b40c459ba6f1c4558336fa7a25f07b86b0e8","04bf2bff610af4ae7a4866a779bb8cb65cf18272","0ea0144f92f67f5872f7f0408e448a5d2aed6849","cf006377fb755b4b84444b86558b9056f19b2f91","8ca0781e82766d50115268faeff807809fbd285f","1e7092714bcae917152790b22c26a36b4720a237","d83b6350a504b36376003035ef9d57fea45c8c0e","09d1fdc81bbaeb85c6274ffbd123ec012070522c","8a94eae113761541961268015e37093bd8249771","0b43c54d492cd5c7b9a97bc7eade0523a2ffc16a","bd6ee1e3311442697d737d02b1f48fb616e5ee5a"],"title":"Testing overall and moderator effects in random effects meta-regression.","doi":"10.1348/000711010X522687"}

We also explore theoretical properties in the case where the within-model prior distributions become increasingly uninformative, which show the need for caution when using Bayes factors as a model choice tool. A suitable form of deviance information criterion is also considered for comparison.

When the historical and current control data are consistent, the borrowing of historical data can increase power and reduce Type I error rate. However, when these 2 sources of data are inconsistent, it may result in a combination of biased estimates, reduced power, and inflation of Type I error rate. In some situations, inconsistency between historical and current control data may be caused by a systematic variation in the measured baseline prognostic factors, which can be appropriately addressed through statistical modeling. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that can incorporate patient-level baseline covariates to enhance the appropriateness of the exchangeability assumption between current and historical control data. The performance of the proposed method is shown through simulation studies, and its application to a clinical trial design for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is described. The proposed method is developed for scenarios involving multiple imbalanced prognostic factors and thus has meaningful implications for clinical trials evaluating new treatments for heterogeneous diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","inCitations":["9f5b55717042f4fc63edb094ad7545938d8d2861"],"title":"Covariate-adjusted borrowing of historical control data in randomized clinical trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1815"}

The ER algorithm of Little and Smith which combines the EM algorithm for missing data and a robust estimation step based on an M-estimator could be used in such a situation. However, the ER algorithm as originally proposed can fail to be robust in some cases, especially in high dimensions. We propose here two alternatives to avoid the problem. One is to combine a small modification of the ER algorithm with a so-called high-breakdown estimator as the starting point for the iterative procedure, and the other is to base the estimation step of the ER algorithm on a high-breakdown estimator. Among the high-breakdown estimators which are actually built to keep their robustness properties even if the number of variables is relatively large, we consider here the minimum covariance determinant estimator and the t-biweight S-estimator. Simulated and real data are used to compare and illustrate the different procedures.","inCitations":["6dc8dcff37a2c5a827596743223fdcdbc718e67b","0963e2cfca95040a57e96933ada3f9f8c2196ae6","56f7dd338ca6beb914a458a2de3583ef82e60d70","f7b2afd7080c3caf913e395ed3615c6ec9b74002","b0a9e6b485e354c5873b7f27969fabf79d172562","4697ef127e224667e6a3407cdc20c60bf199caf4","98dfa9681cee7c546bbc8b00d3046f9a1349ab69","25c03f75b3b57d459b2f02a7d88279cb0acd3956","18fe114abcafc6b424d1753604e0b3651be7bb06","bc03054beddc777a06429c7cf75573a077db1674","70868f71c3213b267e6730425635d29b9ab99b90","faf63349439c31171633d6a975902ca8cd27c7fe","c65d5d3ca7ad5a002bcae022c02e798a2bc0900b"],"title":"High-breakdown estimation of multivariate mean and covariance with missing observations.","doi":"10.1348/000711002760554615"}

We apply our method to real photon arrival data from recent single-molecule biophysical experiments, investigating proteins' conformational dynamics. Our result shows that conformational fluctuation is widely present in protein systems, and that the fluctuation covers a broad range of time scales, highlighting the dynamic and complex nature of proteins' structure.","inCitations":["557d3801dd3eb76685159c53133ec7712b097e27","8a9f268fa06b024048ef791db42a4ff127b923f4","88f678f973fd754103c2d437afd03a792780f3cd","8695461724c6fa994f6e9b77d1a9992383a0d45b","9a1e0dfc1b8c08e1a0ea1c202f801a21bc821107","a4280f46c9fa3640e96fe9ceefaadf4985bf403d","562e6ca4ac9c8eeae36ca5fc565f98a0d49a0f7f","2ef8366d4f54fdce68705429c0214ae4beb41430","347f71ef28d1678377048eeda36c6d02a4a48b06","84bd4490bfcb323d038da4775f07c14adb10e648","f1095ac998f71985acbc5c97f7d8ea3a655b4eb3","a13c73fafa0a5ad58b785e8560bfe791bb24c198","6b2ebe6f3961258bfc565c45ddc5eab66e659391","54eef7da37f264f2a5d39237ed43bab53816aa4a","6f4f85a226a7ffc4e63c9252ea016d4e25015645","c06d157acb6a42b8755ec1c8f63e55e89fe035ca"],"title":"Nonparametric Inference of Doubly Stochastic Poisson Process Data via the Kernel Method.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS352"}

A ranking method and present several other methods to select a set of important genes to use as genomic biomarkers is proposed, and the performance of the selection procedures in patient classification by cross-validation is evaluated. The various selection algorithms are applied to published high-dimensional genomic data sets using several well-known classification methods. For each data set, a set of genes selected on the basis of variable importance that performed the best in classification is reported.

We consider the attributable fraction for a semi-continuous exposure, that is an exposure for which a clump of people have zero exposure and the rest of the people have a continuously distributed positive exposure. Estimation of the attributable fraction involves estimating the conditional probability of having the disease given the exposure. Three main approaches to estimating the probability function are (1) a classical method based on sample averages; (2) parametric regression methods such as logistic regression models and power models; and (3) nonparametric regression methods including local linear smoothing and isotonic regression. We compare performance of these methods in estimating the attributable fraction for a semi-continuous exposure in a simulation study and in an example.","inCitations":["563d46809cc8b0816c44916286ed4a0ddd9cc3b2","20447dca368cf901c69ca5013345b54c6efd92e2"],"title":"A Comparative Study of Parametric and Nonparametric Estimates of the Attributable Fraction for a Semi-continuous Exposure","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1389"}

Fence methods for mixed model selection. Annals of Statistics 36, 1669-1692) is a recently proposed strategy for model selection. It was motivated by the limitation of the traditional information criteria in selecting parsimonious models in some nonconventional situations, such as mixed model selection. Jiang and others (2009. A simplified adaptive fence procedure, Statistics & Probability Letters 79, 625-629) simplified the adaptive fence method of Jiang and others (2008) to make it more suitable and convenient to use in a wide variety of problems. Still, the current modification encounters computational difficulties when applied to high-dimensional and complex problems. To address this concern, we proposed a restricted fence procedure that combines the idea of the fence with that of the restricted maximum likelihood. Furthermore, we propose to use the wild bootstrap for choosing adaptively the tuning parameter used in the restricted fence. We focus on problems of longitudinal studies and demonstrate the performance of the new procedure and its comparison with other procedures of variable selection, including the information criteria and shrinkage methods, in simulation studies. The method is further illustrated by an example of real-data analysis.","inCitations":["f08053fa3000043915e86f3299aefe0829975920","a9bcfcf65ca55368ed635a8c2cab6dfcfbee7c0a","8d9f5469762406d05f210af197c4540ffa5fed6d","c0d7d059688a97c75be1d6f3c2647135c88268ca","d4e29c78d9d3055ef4f1a13f1d6f0a3f4cd18fbe","0fc77b4f9dc1383435b66bd5900806a7ca4e1863"],"title":"Restricted fence method for covariate selection in longitudinal data analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr046"}

Frequently, these tests have continuous outcomes. One popular method to summarize the accuracy of such a test is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Methods for estimating ROC curves have long been available. To examine covariate effects, Pepe (1997, 2000) and Alonzo and Pepe (2002) proposed distribution-free approaches based on a parametric regression model for the ROC curve. Cai and Pepe (2002) extended the parametric ROC regression model by allowing an arbitrary non-parametric baseline function. In this paper, while we follow the same semi-parametric setting as in that paper, we highlight a new estimator that offers several improvements over the earlier work: superior efficiency, the ability to estimate the covariate effects without estimating the non-parametric baseline function and easy implementation with standard software. The methodology is applied to a case control dataset where we evaluate the accuracy of the prostate-specific antigen as a biomarker for early detection of prostate cancer. Simulation studies suggest that the new estimator under the semi-parametric model, while always being more robust, has efficiency that is comparable to or better than the Alonzo and Pepe (2002) estimator from the parametric model.","inCitations":["a54350aa2fc605eebcb8599bf1c44fd4bee427f6","3d080f89f86fcf09902dca4a10d65f02c193679f","acc2693df5239757766543999f8e10162f883895","ea631c63e77a96e0c32ecb5f2a3a99a6d39de4c5","b7f2f53dcb415cc17856120116911fb0582cc788","87e8b65075b699c3dfc9be27f474e7609ad7fe16","faad9ecd855504d109cf3be0924afc55c672bf65","a927e033cb3b7c8f7e87a789e60f7646e3345dd7","691981b4c849c921ef67bf50831c7ebda6d7c912","64fcb22db483908ad0a3d94a051ba9ec719a14cb","a4b455c21867e57d0c515bf045420abc3e097370","7d4270e55bae31f0a8751f5064a6ac6d4c3832db","34083a90679f85e8086b379d0222aef4ac142a5d","1d50f4c4eed5f2e62794a855614174a9c52f73fd","3820c00b0f173d72e5fdad54a0c547a744cd8469","100719afd6c08478e631d31a2f05e49aa91adb96","cc565256a2939cced0b39e2d7e2a41caf98cb250","6708ed5c32a85b150a72417d3b55e690710a2089","c0c56ef28a0a5ea0d68d72339932eadbe25a4d63","4cd8e92fcab8da2c840ff39f14ca35bf5ba6e444","1fdd95483ee52809297e9d6382732a01824f9b56","cb2c79b70c16adf61f1d6bdedc51e878282e9b8e","509e12807f9b55f71969497ffd3fde93714d9147","ec2e7ca4ea749f13d16c29ca497b4a85b1fbd9e7","ecd1a08c83256ce89093ddfd72bd6dcdf4164c93","1aa2b1b8745cea2ce7455570c84ed4add11f5e7c","fb8e9d3b0d6eb82c1e0cf31b630b8a746e64b57b","f243f3ca77cd62c12920500376b38becc3a6bc5b"],"title":"Semi-parametric ROC regression analysis with placement values.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.1.45"}

The resulting models are usually called semiparametric mixed models (SPMMs). We investigate the effect of smoothing using SPMMs on the correlation and variance parameter estimates for serially correlated longitudinal normal, Poisson and binary data. Through simulations, we compare the performance of SPMMs to other simpler methods for estimating the nonlinear association such as fractional polynomials, and using a parametric nonlinear function. Simulation results suggest that, in general, the SPMMs recover the true curves very well and yield reasonable estimates of the correlation and variance parameters. However, for binary outcomes, SPMMs produce biased estimates of the variance parameters for high serially correlated data. We apply these methods to a dataset investigating the association between CD4 cell count and time since seroconversion for HIV infected men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.","inCitations":["6e7b63e7c4f47589239b189712f02d06be783ee0","aafdff3ce4e823a03c1283105ee6a3c792b47065"],"title":"Effect of Smoothing in Generalized Linear Mixed Models on the Estimation of Covariance Parameters for Longitudinal Data","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0026"}

Host genetic influence of HIV infection has been previously studied in HIV-1B, but little attention has been paid to the more prevalent subtype C. To understand the role of host genetics in HIV-1C disease progression, we perform a study to assess the association between longitudinally collected measures of disease and more than 100,000 genetic markers located on chromosome 6. The most common approach to analyzing longitudinal data in this context is linear mixed effects models, which may be overly simplistic in this case. On the other hand, existing flexible and nonparametric methods either require densely sampled points, restrict attention to a single SNP, lack testing procedures, or are cumbersome to fit on the genome-wide scale. We propose a functional principal variance component (FPVC) testing framework which captures the nonlinearity in the CD4 and viral load with low degrees of freedom and is fast enough to carry out thousands or millions of times. The FPVC testing unfolds in two stages. In the first stage, we summarize the markers of disease progression according to their major patterns of variation via functional principal components analysis (FPCA). In the second stage, we employ a simple working model and variance component testing to examine the association between the summaries of disease progression and a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms. We supplement this analysis with simulation results which indicate that FPVC testing can offer large power gains over the standard linear mixed effects model.","inCitations":["d991a865f00a1357f1a487001c1431d7a49bc33c","b20e6b5544456cfae6803835068185bc521dafff"],"title":"Functional Principal Variance Component Testing for a Genetic Association Study of Hiv Progression.","doi":"10.1214/18-AOAS1135"}

Recent developments in deep-learning methods have enabled the identification, characterization, and classification of individual cells from pathology images analysis at a large scale. This creates new opportunities to study the spatial patterns of and interactions among different types of cells. Reliable statistical approaches to modeling such spatial patterns and interactions can provide insight into tumor progression and shed light on the biological mechanisms of cancer. In this article, we consider the problem of modeling a pathology image with irregular locations of three different types of cells: lymphocyte, stromal, and tumor cells. We propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical model, which incorporates a hidden Potts model to project the irregularly distributed cells to a square lattice and a Markov random field prior model to identify regions in a heterogeneous pathology image. The model allows us to quantify the interactions between different types of cells, some of which are clinically meaningful. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques, combined with a double Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, in order to simulate samples approximately from a distribution with an intractable normalizing constant. The proposed model was applied to the pathology images of $205$ lung cancer patients from the National Lung Screening trial, and the results show that the interaction strength between tumor and stromal cells predicts patient prognosis (P = $0.005$). This statistical methodology provides a new perspective for understanding the role of cell-cell interactions in cancer progression.","inCitations":["48dd02f684de882e0cabd611d72f0c0190f8789b","a02250ee2d7851fafcc31d45aa21a1936c23fb89","7ec8bf750cf147987ad0083d27b48adf443ab357"],"title":"A Bayesian hidden Potts mixture model for analyzing lung cancer pathology images.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy019"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"A sequentially adaptive Bayesian design is presented for a clinical trial of cord blood derived natural killer cells to treat severe hematologic malignancies. Given six prognostic subgroups defined by disease type and severity, the goal is to optimize cell dose in each subgroup. The trial has five co-primary outcomes, the times to severe toxicity, cytokine release syndrome, disease progression or response, and death. The design assumes a multivariate Weibull regression model, with marginals depending on dose, subgroup, and patient frailties that induce association among the event times. Utilities of all possible combinations of the nonfatal outcomes over the first 100 days following cell infusion are elicited, with posterior mean utility used as a criterion to optimize dose. For each subgroup, the design stops accrual to doses having an unacceptably high death rate, and at the end of the trial selects the optimal safe dose. A simulation study is presented to validate the design's safety, ability to identify optimal doses, and robustness, and to compare it to a simplified design that ignores patient heterogeneity.","inCitations":["f849aed0895be8b5fccdd8a9b6eab8814d4b376f"],"title":"Optimizing natural killer cell doses for heterogeneous cancer patients on the basis of multiple event times.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12271"}
