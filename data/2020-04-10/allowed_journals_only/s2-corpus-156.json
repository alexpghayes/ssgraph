As with existing models, these models are specified via a linear predictor and a link function for the mean of response Y as a function of predictors X. Here, however, the \"baseline\" distribution of Y at a given reference mean mu(0) is left unspecified and is estimated from the data. The response distribution when the mean differs from mu(0) is then generated via exponential tilting of the baseline distribution, yielding a response model that is a natural exponential family, with corresponding canonical link and variance functions. The resulting model has a level of flexibility similar to the popular proportional odds model. Maximum likelihood estimation is developed for response distributions with finite support, and the new model is studied and illustrated through simulations and example analyses from aging research.","inCitations":["810eea07713cea3816206ba71ba4c0b17e9903b3","feb931ef82e910f3a0e244b1275360808c7d260e","1cf4f9294d07d164d82b52efff91ba724094818a","c2235a9171db88bdefdc3b1ab4ae1b857cc329d5","8552642d779970f0754eb8e1374c728bf3cb23f3","14de791ee63f8afde0206eb68a85e17fdbb9451e","d7d7bb42ce14ae94442f7e8aa1a6ad84e5f71d30","ad18c5777e1d2c90965a2acaf4d96ea72644721d","6d905eb4ac71c60a98ebbe07398360fdd6414768","f58414ad34d41c430c236d840a2c3a53a8e7e0dc","fd936adedd5f7cf9da246dba644d30f8358ce520","ed70705706b62d1c178e94511543da3a37791d5d","5d9ac724782dd46de382ad7ea2c632c3b2611b80","fab9460cc3a4fe9d46ba5d38ab386566cb394adf","e3afbda22f74aae6060bdeaeae60f837273aa466"],"title":"Generalized linear models with unspecified reference distribution.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn030"}

Examples include the analysis of T cell counts in immunological research and studies of gene expression based on counts of RNA fragments. In both cases the items being counted are sequences, of proteins and base pairs, respectively. The resulting sequence-abundance distribution is usually characterized by overdispersion. We propose a Bayesian semi-parametric approach to implement inference for such data. Besides modeling the overdispersion, the approach takes also into account two related sources of bias that are usually associated with sequence counts data: some sequence types may not be recorded during the experiment and the total count may differ from one experiment to another. We illustrate our methodology with two data sets, one regarding the analysis of CD4+ T cell counts in healthy and diabetic mice and another data set concerning the comparison of mRNA fragments recorded in a Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) experiment with gastrointestinal tissue of healthy and cancer patients.","inCitations":["13003060861bde4cd7000692188a806b77e64fb4","f013d60e8bdbdcf95adef25f9896ed200da32019","f90ee1682407db6d521ae373ed144981e95a5beb","a7d393b581208a1206d107fa912039ede894c5b7","1644f11fda8dfe9f95541639015a3acca14ece00","11d17b311482f43e64afacd9b237465473406ef5","9cb10ba88aca51be8739fcec7712c68d802cbb6c","70fdf08e40f52da2aa06433f5dda486412720028","59bbff0e3b4fcfce771c6454a32b50baf3c79cb2","3142418c2c58cdbb072615d9e021bb33f2c3c715","14fdf1bc2334de1fe1a2bd05dc02a74e0e762ef9","73eb9ddc485c57d0d49d07eb0bf707aa3423d5de","bd8ee7c179328a458ef58ecb678dfa914815c546"],"title":"A Bayesian Semi-parametric Approach for the Differential Analysis of Sequence Counts Data.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12041"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Computer Science","Medicine"],"year":2019,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of multivariate analysis","paperAbstract":"Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-known classification technique that enjoyed great success in practical applications. Despite its effectiveness for traditional low-dimensional problems, extensions of LDA are necessary in order to classify high-dimensional data. Many variants of LDA have been proposed in the literature. However, most of these methods do not fully incorporate the structure information among predictors when such information is available. In this paper, we introduce a new high-dimensional LDA technique, namely graph-based sparse LDA (GSLDA), that utilizes the graph structure among the features. In particular, we use the regularized regression formulation for penalized LDA techniques, and propose to impose a structure-based sparse penalty on the discriminant vector β . The graph structure can be either given or estimated from the training data. Moreover, we explore the relationship between the within-class feature structure and the overall feature structure. Based on this relationship, we further propose a variant of our proposed GSLDA to utilize effectively unlabeled data, which can be abundant in the semi-supervised learning setting. With the new regularization, we can obtain a sparse estimate of β and more accurate and interpretable classifiers than many existing methods. Both the selection consistency of β estimation and the convergence rate of the classifier are established, and the resulting classifier has an asymptotic Bayes error rate. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed GSLDA on both simulated and real data studies.","inCitations":["8aa63ea97503fafe81b148c0d221b9051244f46a"],"title":"Graph-based sparse linear discriminant analysis for high-dimensional classification","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2018.12.007"}

This is particularly surprising in the context of regularly repeated in vivo studies where there is a considerable amount of data from historical control groups, which has potential value. This paper describes our experience with introducing Bayesian analysis for such studies using a Bayesian meta-analytic predictive approach. This leads naturally either to an informative prior for a control group as part of a full Bayesian analysis of the next study or using a predictive distribution to replace a control group entirely. We use quality control charts to illustrate study-to-study variation to the scientists and describe informative priors in terms of their approximate effective numbers of animals. We describe two case studies of animal models: the lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine release model used in inflammation and the novel object recognition model used to screen cognitive enhancers, both of which show the advantage of a Bayesian approach over the standard frequentist analysis. We conclude that using Bayesian methods in stable repeated in vivo studies can result in a more effective use of animals, either by reducing the total number of animals used or by increasing the precision of key treatment differences. This will lead to clearer results and supports the \"3Rs initiative\" to Refine, Reduce and Replace animals in research.

In this paper, we demonstrate that what a Gibbs sampler converges to is a function of the order of the sampling scheme. Besides providing the mathematical background of this behavior, we also explain how that happens through a thorough analysis of the examples.","inCitations":["e5afacab42153f24b8e4ca543bd0ecae4e810f10","a2e1dbc04bbbc12754f6d35862a6e5c6ac23c59b","c53940c615f9db7ea05149608ab770b946e1c9ee","c1260a7f0af8b6f1e618ed0afe729c75d42fe343","1c1e362227a364dce562d923d602c6ebf5a9f877","8e1060954e126447c123ea8e7c47f6c4b250ff16","a066233a0b52a0e07197540ff2c73f42daf198f4","dcd5f0cd6ca42ff7d1cdbe036553b652c141c676"],"title":"Behavior of the Gibbs Sampler When Conditional Distributions Are Potentially Incompatible.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2014.968159"}

The application of the typical logit and probit analyses is no longer valid in this situation because it neglects the dependency on time and also the possible interaction of time and dose concentration on the response in the experiment. In this paper, a dose-time-response model is proposed for this type of experiment and a cumulative multinomial generalized linear model that incorporates time and the other experimental conditions as covariates is developed by the theory of maximum likelihood estimation. Both the point estimator and confidence bands for ED50(t), the concentration of a toxicant that will kill 50% of the animals by a specific time, t; as well as LT50(d), the time to 50% mortalities for a specific concentration, d, is then formulated in closed form from the newly proposed dose-time-response model. Finally, the newly proposed model is considered for a real data set to demonstrate the application.","inCitations":["6258adf1d4b615cdd713acc016a46fd95fe375e8","1edf738a5db0392bb9ecd228869a119b5a326273","a425cdd05a9664dcb59e8e364470e70b23971d52","8d02681eabad97570e852c94e7ddf583248cb958","1eb436f73b347b70cd249db5ae3a6211a97f7999"],"title":"Dose-time-response cumulative multinomial generalized linear model.","doi":"10.1080/10543400601001543"}

The motivation and the foundation of the theory are geometrical and are different from classical approaches; however, whilst the proposed measure exhibits a form similar to those in the literature, it still has a considerable advantage in having transformed the classical measures to the unit interval. The new approach unifies outlier identification measures using geometrical concepts. It involves no distributional assumption or large-sample properties, and allows the flexibility of identifying outliers with respect to different metrics. The approach therefore provides a valid reason for using the various measures in complicated situations, such as in non-normal cases and in small-sample problems.","inCitations":["9e44511d1e5f4f387caa6b0fce12b05c1c2b10d8","b949c0852b83b9f8ffb1829a9e5ec9e52460ae3b","191e7f8943d45c15d23ee410962f865e5169449c","6054eb932a62576cff32739590c5ccee065c7ce7","4497284c07f5c03287fd6e132ea7f45681d3d344"],"title":"A local influence approach to identifying multiple multivariate outliers.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159321"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2015,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of multivariate analysis","paperAbstract":"T-optimum designs for model discrimination are notoriously difficult to find because of the computational difficulty involved in solving an optimization problem that involves two layers of optimization. Only a handful of analytical T-optimal designs are available for the simplest problems; the rest in the literature are found using specialized numerical procedures for a specific problem. We propose a potentially more systematic and general way for finding T-optimal designs using a Semi-Infinite Programming (SIP) approach. The strategy requires that we first reformulate the original minimax or maximin optimization problem into an equivalent semi-infinite program and solve it using an exchange-based method where lower and upper bounds produced by solving the outer and the inner programs, are iterated to convergence. A global Nonlinear Programming (NLP) solver is used to handle the subproblems, thus finding the optimal design and the least favorable parametric configuration that minimizes the residual sum of squares from the alternative or test models. We also use a nonlinear program to check the global optimality of the SIP-generated design and automate the construction of globally optimal designs. The algorithm is successfully used to produce results that coincide with several T-optimal designs reported in the literature for various types of model discrimination problems with normally distributed errors. However, our method is more general, merely requiring that the parameters of the model be estimated by a numerical optimization.","inCitations":["273a1b491ae76d387d115daeb6709b94e04890ad","f6648d3c24bed11b00bb62dc4abb26e489e22705","b0aac8572c272795b1ce881d82b945992ce301c0","27e63c71466ce279c14e04e72c1699a206288d8c","f02addb317a535d1da6d1f8027e739b211cece83"],"title":"A Semi-Infinite Programming based algorithm for determining T-optimum designs for model discrimination","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2014.11.006"}

To this end, a dynamic model of the evolution of extraversion (considering its tonic and phasic aspects) has been constructed taking into account the unique personality trait theory and the general modelling methodology. This model consists of a delayed differential equation which, on one hand, considers that the active stimulus, a consequence of a single intake, is not constant; on the other hand, it contemplates that the state variable representing the phasic extraversion also represents the brain activation. The derivative of this state variable is calculated as the sum of the homeostatic control flow, the excitatory effect flow and the inhibitor effect flow. The solutions of this equation relate the tonic activation of an individual (that characterizes his or her personality) with his or her phasic activation level, whose evolution over time describes the organism's response to a single drug intake. These solutions quantitatively reproduce the predictions of current personality theories and anticipate vulnerability to drug misuse and addiction development.","inCitations":["1dfdeb737335f86421e1a08c39bd84be3b2fbf48","99c99b1c45bab2012d392ab59819da501b020dc1","e9676e1b62453e1e4671745493b070e789972a31","35efae2f4c952bc4e316abc1f76251b2d4553193","33d9c857b91e2162ab3ff682cc1f15bc4ae50a53","0c49a8d3d46582f7456a2f7b83570d6e82277d8f","62d9e5fa59cd0301605577cf35ba4602a0ad7438","dfc4355d0ec815f787306c79a2dcd312d3cc8fca","98a255a93b4e7d31a0fd07a09f0417837ae7f72c","c7b1be7d79e105ccef17fd800eec8847376abd29","ac0070c3d332b52b5fe05dd7efec584e30b08d78","59e47d82a57a61ac2a0b56690097f7a9a23185d4","c8667f7e4f8be07922f7300e9f89e3d5a56b9bba","e691f594402b957d555ec9603ebd13ca17fd1b86","7d7fe26c6173d3cf3edfef264de26d63bbcff84c","06e0d83a0cc9606c537165ed43422f5d45286d52"],"title":"A dynamic extraversion model.

Multiple membership data structures are commonly encountered in longitudinal educational data sets in which, for example, mobile students are members of more than one higher-level unit (e.g., school). While the conventional MM requires the user either to delete mobile students' data or to ignore prior schools attended, MMMM permits inclusion of mobile students' data and models the effect of all schools attended on student outcomes. The simulation study identified underestimation of the school-level predictor coefficient, as well as underestimation of the level-two variance component with corresponding overestimation of the level-one variance when multiple membership data structures were ignored. Results are discussed along with limitations and ideas for future MMMM methodological research as well as implications for applied researchers.","inCitations":["8fe09bfef5a762f4a024d5f8a5e50ae9e910ed1c","7b1de881a5937e5bf37e277c819a24d159183d70","1b89f9bc0af072eb7ca37d907a919d8a1a9e2a78","e58db2bbe957ba5b2987efcdd813cbd0eaba3fb5","e73a26c3bcbc82ad97b39db7bdc295718f81dfc3","5d8e7b4ce2d6ac2d6c7fbeb1858493b2e41aacd3","67252bf15a14ed3be1c0f2c85d37f5196b708833","1644b55a0e8195a5991c442b076e7253df82a505","23b0170a471c2137ca087c638d4ab1a0794b78e2","727ad03694aead5749111ce4dc47d6567b252bfe","27abb47c58edbc402768647508730cc180d35b11","d211f1beb6011df03546a468b9177d84c3315d6a","596fa7ab08c91c0dabd46a87851fd8845d3ddc50","521ed6b97f9ccb6b89e669735d9c86baa559f66f","a96d81279a359d8a1c070018f0dc3615f508063d","13407e04245d3db498bc06830c4d2abed92dbb90","9d33ad6d105d3a8e2c83b7d456f2ec5fccda8ba0","374c38b4af002a0265abb86cbd2596fdb1521f95","f5cea751577f2ea37953d2d1c2438f85eea2e250","d5d37f29e76ce9e9720711baaf4997ca4b35e546","5e79b7530965100fdccb7cd02b7f50846abfcca4","4a9f68649c46e18f694159a9218cba79cd81f756","5a091cf692a992952bac63c8d531d57c564984e4"],"title":"The impact of ignoring multiple membership data structures in multilevel models.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02023.x"}

Establishing the relationship of virologic responses with clinical factors and covariates during long-term antiretroviral (ARV) therapy is important to the development of effective treatments. Medication adherence is an important predictor of the effectiveness of ARV treatment, but an appropriate determinant of adherence rate based on medication event monitoring system (MEMS) data is critical to predict virologic outcomes. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of a number of summary determinants of MEMS adherence rates on virologic response measured repeatedly over time in HIV-infected patients. We developed a mechanism-based differential equation model with consideration of drug adherence, interacted by virus susceptibility to drug and baseline characteristics, to characterize the long-term virologic responses after initiation of therapy. This model fully integrates viral load, MEMS adherence, drug resistance and baseline covariates into the data analysis. In this study we employed the proposed model and associated Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach to assess how to efficiently use the MEMS adherence data for prediction of virologic response, and to evaluate the predicting power of each summary metric of the MEMS adherence rates. In particular, we intend to address the questions: (i) how to summarize the MEMS adherence data for efficient prediction of virologic response after accounting for potential confounding factors such as drug resistance and covariates, and (ii) how to evaluate treatment effect of baseline characteristics interacted with adherence and other clinical factors. The approach is applied to an AIDS clinical trial involving 31 patients who had available data as required for the proposed model. Results demonstrate that the appropriate determinants of MEMS adherence rates are important in order to more efficiently predict virologic response, and investigations of adherence to ARV treatment would benefit from measuring not only adherence rate but also its summary metric assessment. Our study also shows that the mechanism-based dynamic model is powerful and effective to establish a relationship of virologic responses with medication adherence, virus resistance to drug and baseline covariates.","inCitations":["d6b0dd58fc17e291d41ca7a8bb6b3fa9466ebb2e","d1fd50bb0e450dc6218972bc617e45374acffc33","6369821794d5dd1a96b5bef2d419cd3b6d1fe134","9dc453af4c7629884ca33f3c88f819f862b7cd4a","872aa166e975bcb678db099ae71455b8723a94c4"],"title":"A Dynamic Bayesian Nonlinear Mixed-effects Model of Hiv Response Incorporating Medication Adherence, Drug Resistance and Covariates().","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS376"}

Estimates can be provided for the speed of information accumulation, for the amount of information used to draw conclusions, and for a decision bias. One parameter describes the duration of non-decisional processes including the duration of motor-response execution. In the default diffusion model, it is implicitly assumed that both responses are executed with the same speed. In some applications of the diffusion model, this assumption will be violated. This will lead to biased parameter estimates. Consequently, we suggest accounting explicitly for differences in the speed of response execution for both responses. Results from a simulation study illustrate that parameter estimates from the default model are biased if the speed of response execution differs between responses. A second simulation study shows that large trial numbers (N>1,000) are needed to detect whether differences in response-execution times are based on different execution times.","inCitations":["f1410c99d993222395d25c3f6eded0c7cb07dff0","f4140bc320ca308d41e37789ef0c46e90fec23f0","ea0f8c8a700309fd6b2a259ca077294cda21b217","e6a2be3caebd58563e30a9f8770594255a7be2aa","3c66a59337b4fbdd832bb88d2f2b0673e6017bc0","903b1eaa0483d05d6a3fd31231340a62a2327ad0","c04590b9bbc011a90dd436b7dd5f643c718bca51","e90ec8af185142f6f4eddf0727ef374eea3bb2b1","d5a6fac56429ff8e7e2b06d9dc7a447169c07f98","e06b9337d8127e387b3077fa04a658f229b2957f","d84c949066f629ceb881519e40774ac70a60d039","37159d94f95e243b78acf1b12ffbfd0405ed4af4","796064389862309d4f36eab0845d93188de4f34d","e78e4f723244f35976588a563f0bcdd9db2f014e","ce6ccb4d5a61c34ae7abe01a020ebf3ce53f26af","ed827d23f92633d6b7632d8b0dfb847b453af682","8cbd5208e409aaf9c7cb1292f34b453ddafe06b5","3b115becb20e2d7db27cc21a7471f0c46d18f7af","040899e777518220e3dad5986522ee7556cfba88","8029a8fcafeb5cdce368e2788a8d7cf39c099fe1"],"title":"Separating response-execution bias from decision bias: arguments for an additional parameter in Ratcliff's diffusion model.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X477581"}

The choice of the dimension of the Euclidean space in (1) is a model selection problem; too few or too many dimensions can degrade classifier performance.

In the development, the missing data are treated as latent quantities, and provision for the incompleteness of the data is made by a hybrid algorithm that combines the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We show by means of a simulation study that the Bayesian estimates are accurate. A Bayesian model comparison procedure based on the Bayes factor and path sampling is proposed. The required observations from the posterior distribution for computing the Bayes factor are simulated by the hybrid algorithm in Bayesian estimation. Our simulation results indicate that the correct model is selected more frequently when the incomplete records are used in the analysis than when they are ignored. The methodology is further illustrated with a real data set from a study concerned with an AIDS preventative intervention for Filipina sex workers.","inCitations":["ecd696e0a2abccd256478fc766c2dbbce118a398","f85593c2e01ba36902a8d77499ed2b2c555fdde6","8a6e36d61289a185c4eeb10efbceeb4dbb7cc5f8","1328018ee6de3c96d0c1556b37184fac7cfc3d35","366db996eceec6891836b4f2cd55adc5ba84b159","ec4568ee42dceb67fd8253489851866a449d5a16","1147ee1a14e4e104d95dda4c56cab97e2c4e2791","92ca25a98616fc5c5d98e9c7edbd65cba91d56ea","851948c91bc26e0a8027801fd4947068a2de083b","841377e8dbaed74e6bba607a1a345786fa9ff7f4","50d21e214afc5c4c4c77fe0c7e74ebc78cc83998","9df6d598cfbdb7377c947e7f985f3f483c70ffbe","3ba8281ff0098690b152189f656f377fa1ba0722","578ac080b3ab0eca12fafb1cde5db3b7638009f9","31f960027b0a1539e17a72daf3f9ed06dbab55ec","c2fbe559f7d5edfb5a0d4db345e593785d7dd0da"],"title":"Bayesian model comparison of nonlinear structural equation models with missing continuous and ordinal categorical data.","doi":"10.1348/000711004849204"}

However, its application is still very limited, partly due to the complexity of existing semiparametric estimation methods. We propose a new semiparametric estimation method based on the induced smoothing and rank type estimates. The parameter estimates and their variances can be easily obtained from the smoothed estimating equation; thus it is easy to use in practice. Our numerical study shows that the new method is more efficient than the existing methods with respect to its variance estimation and coverage probability. The proposed method is employed to reanalyze a data set from a brain tumor treatment study.","inCitations":["09ff9a0c4d0ee2ac15d7d04ef63d392674bf2e1e","48ba6feabbe11df2973ff1424a1ae51f466fd516","e2d3693c14818017f9969e43dd06e49ae3b7a1e2","a2beeb89ada5bf1f14484571d513b0c82da8e2a9"],"title":"Induced smoothing for the semiparametric accelerated hazards model","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2012.04.001"}

The data are observed values of the β human chorionic gonadotropin hormone measured during the first 80 days of gestational age, including from one up to six longitudinal responses for each woman. The main objective in this study is to predict normal versus abnormal pregnancy outcomes from data that are available at the early stages of pregnancy. We achieve the desired classification with a semiparametric hierarchical model. Specifically, we consider a Dirichlet process mixture prior for the distribution of the random effects in each group. The unknown random-effects distributions are allowed to vary across groups but are made dependent by using a design vector to select different features of a single underlying random probability measure. The resulting model is an extension of the dependent Dirichlet process model, with an additional probability model for group classification. The model is shown to perform better than an alternative model which is based on independent Dirichlet processes for the groups. Relevant posterior distributions are summarized by using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.","inCitations":["05c5c2cc027b71d61a6228f3012994e79492c028","3819b56cf7d808d31071f28fdbe81a3cc2d130f6","702a3cae60087ca6b173ff091b0e55316cc70d7f","b4148b0dcf4d519a54f25fa24d68f566b9591631","78cbba806fd65387f3e62e1bf455a9d1d7f0c225","c22a06b7f8f719c4ebff72c2bb3bccd32e85c2a8","5c9e2946d2e219359ad11e242f7f985a020b19ec","0899d023fbf819c44395aadbe725a1b6ad5e626b","47b12210ed1f479a3aaf79571bb51c0e9a082d54","acc2693df5239757766543999f8e10162f883895","c05e2e997f5a68fe836d6efca85062e78dc0160a","e5e9c4700683abf3eb66d4a21d2c3ad8818023ec","0937134ff31b318d254bce3242dbe2031a6738d3","dbb7cf7dbca42908a2d7c8a63a4610b8628752e0","18e65ea84dd15f776fa8f4080c08fb0e2ae463bf","68fc13f2c2cc5cfef07ca6c84d083ffee08e84b8","9886413c4ca00b7badd4cfab672a7ea8efdf6604","dc98f9e243bfa754cc4d4af25375158cf26114b0","8ebde14a247940540318f13de16eb2d92d059931","a5a30c2b7166f2d204e3ba693854ef3c5eb0b81e","0bbd161299877a1815c5935e35a2ac44a64d158e","aa468249744de08ea48136f030a971497f3b65c5","14fdf1bc2334de1fe1a2bd05dc02a74e0e762ef9","6d97972ded12e57fe697a4f861a37f9eb239524b","2e4fec030a0a498ec964303bbc8fa0e920636448","d7c0b7e8a2dacc9fef147ed4a60c07bdbd99901e","69268c90c2c0012b23dd682a9b1b7e4ad8d11112","0bbf45f7411fa9fd5b16014d3e934c63da3ed583","4b23a11404382bbd0dd247ca8f8db76fcea0c345","0763c8cdfdb111c3cff82723b32e6bfdf7ae0dcc"],"title":"Semiparametric Bayesian classification with longitudinal markers.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2007.00569.x"}

A utility maximizing model is set up and used to provide some guidance for an empirical analysis. The data are from an experimental guaranteed job program, the Youth Incentive Entitlement Pilot Project, aimed at young women 16 to 20 years old, from poverty-level families, and not yet high school graduates. The waiting-time regression method of estimation permits the youth in question to be used as her own control revealing how eligibility for the jobs program changes the durations of periods between live-birth conceptions. 3890 women surveyed had 1 birth, 429 had 2, 112 had 3, 26 had 4, and 7 had 5. Without this person specific control described here, the most important factors affecting fertility are number of siblings (negative effect), labor market attachment by parents, especially the father, and the presence of the natural father. With the person specific control, the results predicted from economic theory do emerge: even adolescent and young women consider the economic consequences of fertility reflected in effects of fertility when wages are high in favor of fertility with lower wages. Post program effects (taking place after youths lose eligibility for the program) are a rather rapid making up for foregone fertility, reducing likelihood of net reductions of total fertility.\n","inCitations":["dee8b6724864ff05e87e61b5368405820e17edb9"],"title":"Conception intervals and the substitution of fertility over time.","doi":"10.1016/0304-4076(85)90069-7"}

However, when the number of variables far exceeds the number of subjects, such in the case of large-scale genomic studies, the traditional CCA method is not appropriate. In addition, when the variables are highly correlated the sample covariance matrices become unstable or undefined. To overcome these two issues, sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) for multiple data sets has been proposed using a Lasso type of penalty. However, these methods do not have direct control over sparsity of solution. An additional step that uses Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) has also been suggested to further filter out unimportant features. In this paper, a comparison of four penalty functions (Lasso, Elastic-net, SCAD and Hard-threshold) for SCCA with and without the BIC filtering step have been carried out using both real and simulated genotypic and mRNA expression data. This study indicates that the SCAD penalty with BIC filter would be a preferable penalty function for application of SCCA to genomic data.","inCitations":["006746b8cdcb1052cc9721f8647c0df5caae221a","0e9f182f8c7c531f96961e4bef4274dd3ab06264","4eaf7d85ef7872d89a6acd29282319114108bbdc","ad5f0fa8ddc9fb2a0d95303c2014993a647d0e6d","22b406212bde1db9278fd1cea39f5f8ac1c128d5","0183392448e14bf9727429786f2458c8ebb3409a","e74d86248ae4488004b8e8311050d7d87478170e","17a8a07c9289acb4ef31b450023dcdfa888c5a1d","2b6047629a1f88ef40f0c6c64052a4a6866b061f","690d50d9709da06be02c2f4f3c9e26c128d57afb","1e180d1c41b29b4500d60cbfbfce05c839e63d7b","038d478bd923160689db2999102cbccc9079bc5f","e9e34b380f313e49420c30c081a45de47582dfa1","5b412a9b234dac62f38e457ef7fe320039d4faca","32d1ed05a0904e6d4827c518f29d41e4e1ccd1a8","cd77fdf797dcbc153fccf70d6e854890322998ee","8d8085fcd7a570cafc66a07caace878602ed8241"],"title":"Comparison of penalty functions for sparse canonical correlation analysis","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2011.07.012"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2018,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The annals of applied statistics","paperAbstract":"Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a method for sampling from a target population by leveraging social connections. RDS is invaluable to the study of hard-to-reach populations. However, RDS is costly and can be infeasible. RDS is infeasible when RDS point estimators have small effective sample sizes (large design effects) or when RDS interval estimators have large confidence intervals relative to estimates obtained in previous studies or poor coverage. As a result, researchers need tools to assess whether or not estimation of certain characteristics of interest for specific populations is feasible in advance. In this paper, we develop a simulation-based framework for using pilot data-in the form of a convenience sample of aggregated, egocentric data and estimates of subpopulation sizes within the target population-to assess whether or not RDS is feasible for estimating characteristics of a target population. in doing so, we assume that more is known about egos than alters in the pilot data, which is often the case with aggregated, egocentric data in practice. We build on existing methods for estimating the structure of social networks from aggregated, egocentric sample data and estimates of subpopulation sizes within the target population. We apply this framework to assess the feasibility of estimating the proportion male, proportion bisexual, proportion depressed and proportion infected with HIV/AIDS within three spatially distinct target populations of older lesbian, gay and bisexual adults using pilot data from the caring and Aging with Pride Study and the Gallup Daily Tracking Survey. We conclude that using an RDS sample of 300 subjects is infeasible for estimating the proportion male, but feasible for estimating the proportion bisexual, proportion depressed and proportion infected with HIV/AIDS in all three target populations.","inCitations":["f374ec4a2e08780b9fe175f245d5f54bd2276e17"],"title":"A Simulation-based Framework for Assessing the Feasibility of Respondent-driven Sampling for Estimating Characteristics in Populations of Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Older Adults.","doi":"10.1214/18-AOAS1151"}
