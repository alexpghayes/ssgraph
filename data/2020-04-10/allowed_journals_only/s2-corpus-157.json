The gene expression levels are often treated as quantitative traits and are subject to standard genetic analysis in order to identify the gene expression quantitative loci (eQTL). However, the genetic architecture for many gene expressions may be complex, and poorly estimated genetic architecture may compromise the inferences of the dependency structures of the genes at the transcriptional level. In this paper, we introduce a sparse conditional Gaussian graphical model for studying the conditional independent relationships among a set of gene expressions adjusting for possible genetic effects where the gene expressions are modeled with seemingly unrelated regressions. We present an efficient coordinate descent algorithm to obtain the penalized estimation of both the regression coefficients and sparse concentration matrix. The corresponding graph can be used to determine the conditional independence among a group of genes while adjusting for shared genetic effects. Simulation experiments and asymptotic convergence rates and sparsistency are used to justify our proposed methods. By sparsistency, we mean the property that all parameters that are zero are actually estimated as zero with probability tending to one. We apply our methods to the analysis of a yeast eQTL data set and demonstrate that the conditional Gaussian graphical model leads to more interpretable gene network than standard Gaussian graphical model based on gene expression data alone.","inCitations":["410046116fb4d00097fce17c875d76db6f84c0f6","54ff31d2c29663cab69bd228ef2ce58d9b137d02","6bb0bb7255a665f821637860d80f36f975b488ee","fc1e4e79739a3a930083a777268c03b06b5bda77","232951e620dd8637e46af298fbf906223f443d8b","e96a03dfb1396b7babe1d4f0b059cfaa202a49e7","e652255e7aceaf773ece843af76018229f82532d","9bcdf78978218582bc95cc4a32379b2f32ae583d","94c65c65f32abe9947aa0ee8597e15c63bfbad0c","e2e9735dcd178f03eca95eec077f2191f1b04422","c60a7e843e9195188579ab9616f8f5d5a28af859","1962112a9c60d18bd9ebd2fc280a7f8c0b5f7ec8","37a79a05a6f09b27af8b4c1b20701c40385b5f3c","2b62d1d8c46b5550ad8a88648038e0d3b6f13996","8e6c69b3ae54b1038be312cacc4ca0fcbe4dc7ac","49ba8d0754cb01aae8823f473d5d20b4644a4aa6","08ef30f93b7166ec4286ade5e454f7cd4df2f5c6","126eab001a35aaa10d3f9f5507260e4249135018","e2f7299992e6a4c410a4b8ffa005badbac1cf2e5","8886203ca29c4260951d1275a1490bc4bb07d4af","ba19c18abfc2866bf4b52ac9a4464268077ece51","0e818add4bb54d5dcd35cd3f592ad1e4cd874fce","ddadfdc5bce82fcf5179038ddff6e2176d5ee84f","37e23c66733b4f3d38b3dce722d5ce4e7cf518d1","3a60c4404b114a1de740dea728dee202849def02","585bb6c9f4acb311848f24cd7151f59d8ac458dc","26be8098ea674bf1351fcf81e2df106bdea50cd6","1ce819c4bbb6d0611666d00384592ffd6da04036","14770ce4ec3f06d74d0b328057867b45cbb400ce","6ccf18ed4566c53a88b6cc3f3dda75045ea8ccee","17a8a07c9289acb4ef31b450023dcdfa888c5a1d","34d35bd3c0d430bac325db787d37194558f86307","792e224fe0bc16b58bbdb8e5912b09f1c137d10d","1ba48f0abb41600e78066a2980ce05ea0c0c9d44","d724c3b5d74a3f7c477464111841fcf4e6cbcd3a","2ba6685cc139a01817a4a903eabb9ea283ab704b","74ee98dfc8f6c725cb0dbcc83bb53beaedbb4ef4","3a3fd9addbc40d10a66255598e47967fc2c5f10d","4eb6d1f0d6d38d620279e5c922fc13ff9ed857f6","d3e6fa23c1a916bbf1f02fd333584becf4d7ee2e","166163edb5c6d310faa9b384ab9a734e09622a4f","ea9724f61d8dcd4d63d80033d1a1867440332ab8","de7f4c4359f05a472cd0f983d71c517195821a75","9fb71107492080f4396293a0cabf24b4db7a8e13","e3cc925b4469d2bee7cf8591fbbe81f360aafbe3","083f71c01bfba30324159b7fe67cb0ae11dd97b0","1c84c313fc4d7d37b591810c9ee95b20530db973","971afc8b75a7b52ab9e5b56814bc3bd55470bb3a","00dac1e79762ca6900cd5e5b64ff40de3da6620f","000777e06f4ba43dca6ff2cec750b30d1927b164","1cbf9c54c826bd2af80dac26928c99ea017466ca","050f758b900ee417aeb67bb4cb52ef2a80834ba0","b3b6b563262493041f9bd79a69fa34df17ada184","9b1d44493ddf930e4e5875957f70b9db4c164011","901ac642b3ee79931cc919fde486b8e69e3d7c32","666ecd7c53967418ab5c1eed7262df1108571f37","d164a830ca0b765f59eeed46a9593d93f56babe2","0bb344329f7a89a9cba84603abab1589957c9343","f24716424fdcf82486f66042295838d5c5fef0ae","a582202229003019b19067578eb63cb8b070fade","3c949e50eef81164ae5615e5e432f4a0377ab82e","2843c2136ec3994e53594c1ca3fbd73ab2c94745","3552ff05fc156f7e1489c85b903e5af43269d1db","37e7d2363b8d85a3b016db2c14bc782b0b6e9406","815531d321d72c0bfa0093f302a955a157ce3128","8000be78ba378fb4233c9bd9b7e5cf4af352d5f3","de955686a3ea90c580114038e30888c65223aebf","a66e91d1594834f1a667b3740bbcb31445b35da7","367669fd7ceae8dafb22ae37be7b8b0a6b8a1e55","f9a9030e6deff7f685d78345d5a6e660d6e2d3f9","fd1b0a2d46e4fb95e84b993345b89856fc5ac4d8","423ee341652d9990ffc40de0c27a28cd4aaff5a1","a25d048a77b00fe689319bfa38eb95e0db26c7eb","20cc8b64867643ac9311028ec3bb7c4074c5eb28","c25ad7b478aabaa32c92d37c4aebde7ad9ac2e5c","2b1e7ef69cf6319cf98be8bdd401f52413b736f8","c35dab442a29e359fff3b8f87b3297d009785a20","a4de78e0477efe057f44ef499f1439b697bccb2a","7d4a20407dcb0f18953d3025954afb2f07035aef","3917fb9c1fa786b4c1dc803668c9d399be30e8cf","aaf91bfd9eccfd0942ee8be9e5fa8d0627ea77ab","3b3805f37cd837c515689dbc6c8f947cf81b97d2","9c5a9c11c2e54d8c1b24ae42ca76b6e2dbe9844d","83ace21413a9a4bf9cc6bec8273aff7d664057c2","ffff6548d9a6c6f589d8c0f314eddfb0c8246dee","6de01b08542fc7bd15407bb64053e9d5aeb1dcb1","48d8a3e2db2885075ad552fc253823cbb3aa862c","1a6f0c6f52ad0fc2be86235fcc276ec7f50fce4f","35b84923a5f26eebe4a833158ea54fa25cbf85e1","07f5c8285c1f67b8a4ac88a43d4a96e40a9f4dd1"],"title":"A Sparse Conditional Gaussian Graphical Model for Analysis of Genetical Genomics Data.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS494"}

Replicate ECGs are defined as single ECG recorded within several minutes of a nominal time (PhRMA, 2003). Formulas for sample size calculations with and without adjustment for covariates such as some pharmacokinetic responses (e.g., AUC or C(max)), which are known to be correlated to the QT intervals, were derived under both the parallel-group design and the crossover design. The results indicate that the approach of replicates may require a smaller sample size for achieving the same power when the correlation coefficient between the recording replicates (or repeated measures) is close to 0 (i.e., these replicate ECGs are almost independent). On the other hand, if the correlation coefficient is close to 1, then there is not much gain regardless of whether replicate ECGs are considered. In this paper, an approach to identifying optimal allocation between the number of subjects and the number of replicates per subject is proposed for achieving the maximum power under a fixed budget constraint. The proposed approach can also be applied to minimize the cost for a given power.","inCitations":["eaa2721c86764801b6e9830c98048300321df22c","c8b52adf6838a65aed009c2b53131df89e6fc8ed","1836c9ee1cb9f1ecbb4cf93204f65125c95319de","c43df15be01317f730319633051ccb994b2c3ab4","cec245b81e62ce40e4713b4335764b129bf49937","1661cd4f5da7a68da6a478ef69b5ff7591a96c3c","f70daa47bfe95d32ce46ed483ed7756623189e50","e7898ae232e536afc9943ad14d81ea153d13710f"],"title":"On power and sample size calculation for QT studies with recording replicates at given time point.","doi":"10.1080/10543400801995452"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2006,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"One of the most important steps in the design of a pharmaceutical clinical trial is the estimation of the sample size. For a superiority trial the sample size formula (to achieve a stated power) would be based on a given clinically meaningful difference and a value for the population variance. The formula is typically used as though this population variance is known whereas in reality it is unknown and is replaced by an estimate with its associated uncertainty. The variance estimate would be derived from an earlier similarly designed study (or an overall estimate from several previous studies) and its precision would depend on its degrees of freedom. This paper provides a solution for the calculation of sample sizes that allows for the imprecision in the estimate of the sample variance and shows how traditional formulae give sample sizes that are too small since they do not allow for this uncertainty with the deficiency being more acute with fewer degrees of freedom. It is recommended that the methodology described in this paper should be used when the sample variance has less than 200 degrees of freedom.","inCitations":["863c0e499d88d323ae4727944687cb1a10ec28fa","b3325f9be0df6ac33e1036e2c409d7ee29ab0c69","acf7c691cd77fce40fa8d45f63c5d2971e6ec50d","80a7831eea7b4c575c94deade302182749cc7617","89133babd272b7deaa29a0d43a24502d39a7a591","4958d37bbaeda83b2ca76bd3bd29b5fc932d75a1","2f3f2b45b460729de966bc881dba42dc2ced15b3","755d7ef37518b8038933c8409ee0080a35505706","7921679aabb6ca4c38085f028613647ad7dc38fc","62811f60d94878cfe369e194833deb0091fb1154","fd3b413e23fa3aca511afeea010305ddcbfa06f2","4b18702c1235112fe4fd34fd6958153e1bc24ae4","9764bbbb1915c1e0ea5475fb94ce8a5e52e38ba1","276ad1a669f522c45cbaab5528dc63896e7602af","ed5c5be3c0c08efe052edc64d8027f1c9a6fd0ee","7bed4735c085dbb9182917dcd80b1fafc194a2e3","b028b6d1a2b4c7f3e4b83ab6aa000f700841d302","cc6a9bd29aad266dfa08e4c9827d94b281b9bfc5","dce1a3fc6193cdb10b038120d5dd8ba1757bb5c5"],"title":"Sample size calculations for clinical studies allowing for uncertainty about the variance.","doi":"10.1002/pst.197"}

The results indicated that the refined a-stratified design performed well in reducing item overexposure rates, balancing item usage within the pool, and maintaining measurement precision, in a situation where all four procedures were forced to balance content.","inCitations":["47b33662ed5d09ef09e77c841aaeb64c598c1774","6b9bb2e6030be7c234287c3947e190d938de2058","43da9cab86dc0021d6ab514e2a5c216a53cb17bb","d652e6bf7c793259269ae5f57387cd6a18bbc148","b19bc57227b70af7907729bce1ba50a5c8a21976","b9b898a0e6d6aef7f8d27fc8aa24920d09b838a6","6aedee4c0838c5f170dc8ef6752ef5df03709edb","622dd2c4e5ae8da9657ecdd977b320f29bfd8a75","67171188fdef81d0efe5670a639e487cfca0c129","8711984b2014915decbad6e08eb5db84d0a2ed49","826833b93b45703ac46547e81e84c37a8e0839ef","98bfad11ccaea091786a05edf3267847352f137c","c297c6ab4e47d4ff01ad2a9bda50f5a6e177fb6f","6041b259767fa61c1d55dd8c810932283b49343e","a0810512135a0aab51ca3404951662412e2b5256"],"title":"a-Stratified CAT design with content blocking.","doi":"10.1348/000711003770480084"}

The T/C ratio is converted to an antitumor activity rating using an arbitrary cutoff point and often without any formal statistical inference. Here, we applied a nonparametric bootstrap method and a small sample likelihood ratio statistic to make a statistical inference of the T/C ratio, including both hypothesis testing and a confidence interval estimate. Furthermore, sample size and power are also discussed for statistical design of tumor xenograft experiments. Tumor xenograft data from an actual experiment were analyzed to illustrate the application.","inCitations":["ee5941d195b158a46dc53eedafce097eda6d86f0","3dd092c669418777e576b401425df43684fa6c82","db04b60c96633e3ac2fd9866366eece75b7c5a5f","0b96b1a0e2821fd20d3660ddf5bef62219683910","1b75e0f2d64d9bfb856adbbf7a83de260021e481","e8b66419103c61d1ea9fb1b329f7d5c9f098e351","a98c7ef0a52e6ce8897490a00a1bb15f03efac0b","7b80c3c1d6cfa8cde2877e73f64e59ca2885c12b","2cbaeffc63f9732265768b02f05eeef814853383","ff4484e8b28d7f5079a40732efedf9ffddbe75bb","999bdff4623246c729f765a95c6129fd5b45f4b9","9e538c78514f048fcdae97ab583260d5d251071c","ec1273cf1e86edc442f2b22b1f4c601d1cbe3da4","9788a9f9a73b8618eebbcb5f6fc12514f8959df7","a428a7080215a9ea74d70770259c962f169a58c2","905c6f0bfd541024dd94b55661c5debca79d6cad","5b6a09fe7a085e22df41b087bcf7b14b3d66f500"],"title":"Statistical inference for tumor growth inhibition T/C ratio.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003618983"}

The test can be applied to multiple phenotypes and to phenotypic data obtained in longitudinal studies without making any distributional assumptions for the phenotypic observations. Methods for handling missing phenotypic information are discussed. Further, we compare the power of the multivariate test with permutation tests and with using separate tests for each outcome which are adjusted for multiple testing.

In particular, the relations between members of one pair of nodes may have an effect on the relations between members of another pair. This article develops a type of regression model to estimate such effects in the context of longitudinal and multivariate relational data, or other data that can be represented in the form of a tensor. The model is based on a general multilinear tensor regression model, a special case of which is a tensor autoregression model in which the tensor of relations at one time point are parsimoniously regressed on relations from previous time points. This is done via a separable, or Kronecker-structured, regression parameter along with a separable covariance model. In the context of an analysis of longitudinal multivariate relational data, it is shown how the multilinear tensor regression model can represent patterns that often appear in relational and network data, such as reciprocity and transitivity.","inCitations":["1e2de3a029c5b27862a1c9aa4cfadb3561cdba3e","33fc100fa2a003ae068e7db503576591aa521c01","cb41b3c0dce2037177c4ea25859760971f7a62fa","97a2df086487636e2b4b87eb48f0f74e7b81a2e7","727898f95fbdc494e7e02b0406e33cecda39dc7d","2c04d25839b0a6e8371bc854502cfb26929ca882","76bcdc31ae835a61a1e2e5488d2fa016eba4794a","7090f1e2d2c27215a3959701cf512af38e7a7c31","d5a71ede563103791ede5029e9f9ea461d3efbf1","5561ae4b2f4a727879648adb4db83440f42e682d","80cf0e59a6acc35b1e4260dd716a9a82aad8fcf5","b9cf6a5c07206913c863c858254e1a02b008d6ee","0495d5587e559420425c96e5d1197ece8c6f8de1","d6c1c488936f9ef04080c7844200f3a15c2f7fc0","85eafc10acc21f4842680726c4c9aa2415e67290","d74edb3945588b36455d11bd8b9938f9f7afbc50","bfcedf88ee2c57fd68ceca82d18dec7088667777","7293996f4a8984b15efeb772b51fb466ea7bc7e8","ad54b92ae0ae0b8cdc6c152183f700ac4f5288a7","6fa325b08c7c74dc9427a74a734f5afbaea3b396","f2485ee93ef70bc307a418ec904271ebe54af76d","0ee3535732c7fe44ae43e1a6d77ce1ff770bf208","55aa3a60ef84cca24e567b2e31dae780bd23aa12","51e7f55ca7260e907117c0c74070c43826bced03","6ab2edc95ae9afc8a3515b8c8ef52aa3296b9c72","646ede580b28ca6bf1522eb287670ec4738967d3","b919425fbfc0be486177dd78cc16f8f52df043ac","23103a02696f4bab976cfece5e719ba48d5b06d1","7668ff48d0c4faee44423579dc9481a0663e0044","946262c5252312fd8edb623d46cf65a79b5c321f","3a3aa1fdbd490ea66858999df6a4e1e878362f2c","0981630bab822e13227302c039cfd1f18f111ebc","4e86335e65d79cb0c33ef19f5abefda3aa6e5b4c","1f5c5d1388c074e61d66c82bf5bd50a9238c2a7d","cd2ed27748d02bd8d1208eecd7780ed6b8d5ac80","35b12671a8524484d52b7b0abc180530954da1aa","13b745f50406dd36f18369c901b5be4587e77272","45bd3cefc0d9a12ce0da0a017fd118b7d71f3eab","51329869e1666d72fc4f9c1e62fc59edb9872af8","cfed81aad207940bdb4f283e85a0f9686f4b8453","a143c1abcf826fb81723e91100769d382b359450","bb11b71f6bcba2cada99ce6b8f8c2f7c6971e1d4","9126bdbde8fa8bd6a77e4732c6af227d0a2f01a0","c80c7ac7764112633f0e31a524f0d6e792fc16b8","1c01dc5dc7e61adc28812d4d1ad0225d3439ca1b","4ddb48f5e50ecf3595a0ef2517d36d077f968e25","e534d4fee63d3f2150f8e1aafcc1358616865b99","604f963a510cde90d98d1f2ae990590a733be228","6c6c7ef46be1286a37113a68b019773f2a735b5f","556609ad8cef878c34125af21d377c49e00fa828","87bd7d00c4f20df65b5d948f4e8fcabfec87a0c7","e702da6dd47efa254743aacc90aa690a35e614cc","ca42594b8c466e7013bdd95c753a017e6d3e5d9a","e03232f936068366ac259fd0f01c075d12a29ce8","706d7ae56545c241fc2463bdde94507db1de8196"],"title":"Multilinear Tensor Regression for Longitudinal Relational Data.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS839"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":1999,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"We discuss an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM) for use in phase I dose-finding studies. The extension enables the method to be applied to two groups of patients to determine the appropriate dose levels for each group. The method takes the specification of a simple relationship between the dose-toxicity curves for the two groups and runs the CRM on the bivariate model using maximum likelihood. We prove consistency of the method under fairly weak conditions and provide several simulations to give an idea how the method works in practice. We also undertake an evaluation of its performance by considering three possible situations: The first is the two-sample CRM, which directly uses a working model for the relationship between the two groups, carrying out a single trial using this method; the second situation carries out single trials for each of the two groups separately using the original (one-sample) CRM. The third situation is the case where such heterogeneity is ignored and the two groups are pooled into a single group, again using the original (one-sample) CRM. Simulations are carried out under a large class of model misspecifications, both of the dose-toxicity relationships and of the functional form linking the groups, and are backed up by asymptotic results. Our conclusions match intuition: The first scheme gives the most favorable results when the two groups are different but share some features. When the groups are very different, the second scheme performs similarly to the first for finite sample sizes while having some advantages in terms of asymptotic efficiency. The third, as expected, gives the best results in the absence of patient heterogeneity. The two-sample method appears particularly advantageous when there may not be enough subjects in one of the subgroups for it to be feasible to carry out two trials.","inCitations":["5db722b8a43eeaf89fec2ff88dc5cd958d9c9407","ef192e23b1d76fc674f294c0b5b52525c8e880ff","f9f396d9ee5d46907cbd9c6a60ec936ba76f9180","63c397ff1e9cd1b4faded356154689f680dc1784","1400bc8b2f57af323f0f8c5e6e88bc83955bef0d","b701c7757f50348d58fff1650f543888717b3720","98d1abab0c5be31e3cc9b23d3c8825a533046add","3abea72b53bb7d02b62e5afa3ad6d3f6c5d44065","647d46a7a2eebffefe69948c8ee7498376131ba2","d4a4b2749bec8b77d67e08d1fad1e5c6657247fe","d41e44d888cf682defbd237a7e17842f10bedb7c","40c0a1dd50cd04367b425997545e48c75c0643ee","9802c1d9ef1869a6a5f27ff20530a9f7ab87a08b","40f06efbee72fb1ccd9b26d4e27f5bf6bf0670d2","3e10c60716d9a705d8fd2b12c31f3ba717b23d70","3008f9f915498ba67f8c26d3506334df48935453","041c6ff0d3e284673baa6042f7c4400ddc9a374e","19d7ff535ee661cdd6be30bf9908eda845adfb47","80ead2efe0cb6571cd63552277738c0667818a1e","42c174dc2b6c04929d2ef23f1f7c27746c0907f8","b563490dc984ce916bfb0d4a5dca29dd19eb2a49","07f55deb178b0e088156c61eee7727c9a310acfd","f0eef2c148cf35593279903232c9c82323577f4a","4b3e17b8a6d31bc4b59665c9732efca3237ac45e","8484be05b4d17eb466f6b1098e559f82127daabf"],"title":"Two-sample continual reassessment method.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100100998"}

By large dimension is meant the number of repeated measures and the total sample size grow together but either one could be larger than the other. Asymptotic distribution of the statistics are derived for the equal as well as unequal covariance cases in the balanced as well as unbalanced cases. The asymptotic framework considered requires proportional growth of the sample sizes and the dimension of the repeated measures in the unequal covariance case. In the equal covariance case, one can grow at much faster rate than the other. The derivations of the asymptotic distributions mimic that of Central Limit Theorem with some important peculiarities addressed with sufficient rigor. Consistent and unbiased estimators of the asymptotic variances, which make efficient use of all the observations, are also derived. Simulation study provides favorable evidence for the accuracy of the asymptotic approximation under the null hypothesis. Power simulations have shown that the new methods have comparable power with a popular method known to work well in low-dimensional situation but the new methods have shown enormous advantage when the dimension is large. Data from Electroencephalograph (EEG) experiment is analyzed to illustrate the application of the results.","inCitations":["a31ea40003ad08798dc9b5e02566bd94e1f73bde","80448450b1144878c9b191ccf099878ec01288bd","da3cc7b79150834cd414122c73749302e51460b3","84fdff6d484cc714c5cf9ecd8341ad8623b0523e","9e1adafb7bf88a7cc1b73164fb13c4616661aaa5"],"title":"High-dimensional multivariate repeated measures analysis with unequal covariance matrices","doi":"10.1016/j.jmva.2015.11.012"}

Most statistical methods for using validation sets rely on the assumption that outcomes on those with no cultures are missing at random (MAR). However, often the validation sets will not be chosen at random. For example, confirmational cultures are often done on people with influenza-like illness as part of routine influenza surveillance. VE estimates based on such non-MAR validation sets could be biased. Here we propose frequentist and Bayesian approaches for estimating VE in the presence of validation bias. Our work builds on the ideas of Rotnitzky and others (1998, 2001), Scharfstein and others (1999, 2003), and Robins and others (2000). Our methods require expert opinion about the nature of the validation selection bias. In a re-analysis of an influenza vaccine study, we found, using the beliefs of a flu expert, that within any plausible range of selection bias the VE estimate based on the validation sets is much higher than the point estimate using just the non-specific case definition. Our approach is generally applicable to studies with missing binary outcomes with categorical covariates.","inCitations":["9c0d4280ebb79a1283fe4c1dbbbea0b0f6d361e5","e35637b003592ae8c9b26f16fd132c0ca0afa8a2","c7bf85b8a76ee7d3b50e9e86db099622319c3245","8c4ecef75dc8e10aa67f89a5c5d73ac21756a01b","9a9fb1e812bd0d420975ae6216ff7005279eb1b1","384f9dff09a6385eb28e9aa8d67b897477282ca8","10b3eb4eb60ba922c6c3fcbfa1c89479c856a1bd","30190f0dd8d7477893dc8d69c54686416a58853b","c11150da34526ab9a121246cc47b0965f546d1a5","7ea9585018d8e132f85e68013a9e8bbaafe19881","223f55b9d9fb721ebbf8c28aaef299b10be13f9b","9580bfcbdb77b78a21887a8911bb9b69444182a4","2a8dd43a3288c6e6379debbe765e184949123441","de83b482f28a1f13106ca33aae980cd5c5dc3e07","638c18510c141e19d7335340b1ae37469e7f6e94","247c597e2bb5e7298537fc1a289b4ee1b7ad8272","3e8d986f56b6afb805e70236871627835e68372c","61b62d94fb0f01b8f600e449f2d89f705f8d44db","1a365cf57c305192803c93040fa350ecca449d7c"],"title":"On estimation of vaccine efficacy using validation samples with selection bias.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj031"}

Searching for differences among subgroups is challenging because it is inherently a multiple testing problem with the complication that test statistics for subgroups are typically highly dependent, making simple multiplicity corrections such as the Bonferroni correction too conservative. In this article, a Bayesian approach to identify subgroup effects is proposed, with a scheme for assigning prior probabilities to possible subgroup effects that accounts for multiplicity and yet allows for (preexperimental) preference to specific subgroups. The analysis utilizes a new Bayesian model selection methodology and, as a by-product, produces individual probabilities of treatment effect that could be of use in personalized medicine. The analysis is illustrated on an example involving subgroup analysis of biomarker effects on treatments.","inCitations":["5c7fbcde955cf71cb6f9abcafe937d1ec5c8ac8a","761acc40fb4752d32046cda40d4de5c29db7a0ac","400a42b1d560b967733ae438b9ee74678134bda1","816f71cb8a97943f66063a67f8fa187dea106c01","05e86eac0217e7dc17e69abb67c48b35cf87738e","f4112b7d2f0467770c50a7bb10c869c6b0d8afd6","ce9dbcbde4543559b7e4dccf412022d4874bcd84","e7bf4d0f240085bafabd72bf1258f0b131d6b48c","9fd3ddc85857e356a5fed7960563c3eb6d87e188","136608b41f97c4b29408d46e7ccf3be189eeecb8","8c136c9f03d82869f716d212a1b4cb97896cab48","2d978be4ab99b4924083de721f9e81ee71c212e2","b2590006c09c6635647b60c354a6c4d7a923cd59","d290797a05041405bfd179c397e571cc3dba5374","a6cf1110be73e1e0987ff714f4a3f233eca94bf3","27a43451ef54dd48cc014b4669ec295f0cb40076","8bf3a9890d90eed8cd1e68a6d3afff0b3b775b3e","a31882f6491d6426eaabc79f464ba5529da17f56","b1dd6d1ee1dcf686e75e9bbcd54767f861d7ce0e","50ff277bf92dd0f21d5cb48b0bab35292447f210","d03b582c6679feff7db6976a77bbd63f544a9307","2f910452685cc968a153a2555ed0bd4c33d43298","f78ba191ee2ccc2af299e16946358ebfa373fbee","551624e6feff06eca40aa7a38cfcab9bfcb445bd","96712e9f9d2748b492894efb6b9e7e6d681d4aa0","202ba5bc97870eab667a1f7276915b9fbe242cdc","86e12a38ff7fdbc7617e9537db32248403ab150d","56c37da5a54a05e9d629293785abd51e3c9cdaad","2822cd4f41962615b1ae6e1a8480a3c4afe1b33f","43ef6f75c7b0aaf61cbebf7796041bacc27a4b34","ea566b87e415e3810395b490ab6705c353a7e9a5","6f118547618fa36f778967df5a46b7a4258d5633","6246ed268002e6738068dae01ad38e4985ee7cd5","36acb1efa73a92172999c21f38de80e2d90712ac","4c081c50d372c7eba877a969e0d1f8001289b593","1ca6c20a9e8750a17a3c1b8dbec5619f228eb469","16d5f92c81e1113cb9bfc4c4cf59c035d8a51417"],"title":"A Bayesian approach to subgroup identification.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.856026"}

As such, care must be taken in modeling the covariance matrix. However, estimation of the covariance matrix is challenging because there are many parameters in the matrix and the estimated covariance matrix should be positive definite. To overcomes these limitations, two Cholesky decomposition approaches have been proposed: modified Cholesky decomposition for autoregressive (AR) structure and moving average Cholesky decomposition for moving average (MA) structure, respectively. However, the correlations of repeated outcomes are often not captured parsimoniously using either approach separately. In this paper, we propose a class of flexible, nonstationary, heteroscedastic models that exploits the structure allowed by combining the AR and MA modeling of the covariance matrix that we denote as ARMACD. We analyze a recent lung cancer study to illustrate the power of our proposed methods.","inCitations":["1c9c0a1b9b416ba908047e289131e9a9e0ebd2cc"],"title":"ARMA Cholesky factor models for the covariance matrix of linear models","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2017.05.001"}

Epidemiological and environmental researchers have been using it to select the observations for more powerful and cost-effective studies. Motivated by a study of the effect of in utero exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls on children's IQ at age 7, in which the effect of an important confounding variable is nonlinear, we consider a semi-parametric regression model for data from an outcome-dependent sampling scheme where the relationship between the response and covariates is only partially parameterized. We propose a penalized spline maximum likelihood estimation (PSMLE) for inference on both the parametric and the nonparametric components and develop their asymptotic properties. Through simulation studies and an analysis of the IQ study, we compare the proposed estimator with several competing estimators. Practical considerations of implementing those estimators are discussed.","inCitations":["48db2f51ff3fc899b126a3cfa231275ec3092bef","2a6f449a1a16e46098b066cf171b5e408e30436a"],"title":"A Partially Linear Regression Model for Data from an Outcome-Dependent Sampling Design.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00756.x"}

But what can be said when head-to-head treatment comparisons turn out to be less clear-cut than this? Here, we propose two additional sets of specific LC and/or ME confidence thresholds to define the concepts of \"some dominance\" and \"much dominance.\" Confidence levels associated with entire quadrants of the incremental cost-effectiveness (ICE) plane are easily computed using the same bootstrapping techniques used to estimate an \"acceptability curve.\" Our two proposed additional \"degrees\" of dominance, although less stringent than strict dominance, are nevertheless more stringent than commonly accepted approaches using ICE ratio or net benefit calculations. To illustrate analysis concepts, we use data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled clinical registration trial for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). As is typical, our case study is rather small and short term, providing outcome information for a total of only 264 patients during their initial 8 weeks of acute-phase MDD treatment. Thus, we focus attention on sensitivity analyses, showing that the bootstrap distribution of cost-effectiveness uncertainty is robust across two alternative ways of measuring overall effectiveness and three alternative ways of imputing missing values. Evaluation of the balance between cost and benefit is particularly difficult when a new pharmacological treatment is first introduced, yet information of this sort is highly desired by decision makers. We show that, even with only a relatively modest amount of clinical trial information, sensitivity analyses can still confirm that cost-effectiveness comparisons are being made in a consistent fashion. In contrast, extensive follow-up comparisons using data from actual clinical practice will almost always ultimately be needed to better inform health policy makers.","inCitations":["f7a3a88da17da2bccf8aa3ad7c9d7a995070a341","41f6be17041f1696db5ae697e93866a47b699b24","213c922cb2faee11ed576a72b08cf7cefb413a7b","dc2cbc13a7668c56bd86820fd6b26bbe7c67e5a6","5478858b6c5d5b29eafd9706433c1cf1167543c0","216cf1d3b82a203cd97be68c3c70f05273d4b30f"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness inferences from bootstrap quadrant confidence levels: three degrees of dominance.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200056525"}

When there are multiple sources of information available, it is often of interest to construct a composite score that can provide better classification accuracy than any individual measurement. In this paper, we consider robust procedures for optimally combining tests when test results are measured prior to disease onset and disease status evolves over time. To account for censoring of disease onset time, the most commonly used approach to combining tests to detect subsequent disease status is to fit a proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) and use the estimated risk score. However, simulation studies suggested that such a risk score may have poor accuracy when the proportional hazards assumption fails. We propose the use of a nonparametric transformation model (Han, 1987) as a working model to derive an optimal composite score with theoretical justification. We demonstrate that the proposed score is the optimal score when the model holds and is optimal \"on average\" among linear scores even if the model fails. Time-dependent sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curve functions are used to quantify the accuracy of the resulting composite score. We provide consistent and asymptotically Gaussian estimators of these accuracy measures. A simple model-free resampling procedure is proposed to obtain all consistent variance estimators. We illustrate the new proposals with simulation studies and an analysis of a breast cancer gene expression data set.","inCitations":["f0a51a99091275d4dbfe902ea5931feb1a41a8a7","0aea49d4d9f2183520a27e23d4d3dbd066bee11e","8ad621ce63177e72762a7e6c74c48e8ee301821d","5e89f9e7f0dc3a763e1bfd25ee5ed389c7ffadce","8cd31e4e57be0899221af61df4a058a40aac8e6d","c0b62fb33ddee1a124820c9318367561bbc8811f","7d934d277abfe507631f9d181effa40ffad3fd38","8e46ac87befa7094747cdc593ffe37e264711d5a","7e1983badf67c9115042e77006ed53a96e1f9722","0a5b6425a9568e08f5a47e1165e288ed58a56ce5"],"title":"Robust combination of multiple diagnostic tests for classifying censored event times.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm037"}

Such a design allows a sufficient number of cases to be obtained without extensive sampling and can increase efficiency; however, these case-control samples are then biased since the proportion of cases in the sample is not the same as the population of interest. Methods for analyzing case-control studies have focused on utilizing logistic regression models that provide conditional and not causal estimates of the odds ratio. This article will demonstrate the use of the prevalence probability and case-control weighted targeted maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), as described by van der Laan (2008), in order to obtain causal estimates of the parameters of interest (risk difference, relative risk, and odds ratio). It is meant to be used as a guide for researchers, with step-by-step directions to implement this methodology. We will also present simulation studies that show the improved efficiency of the case-control weighted targeted MLE compared to other techniques.","inCitations":["45cd7649a769298dae87f1ca02aa55ccd5cfabde","e996fdf996b787cd052db8e1978597c73c01b9a0","8d8029cde8c9859caf85bdf3880310fa09d409a1","b669a6fff30ea7be5909e90f33a3767687150486","015dc404783bc276d5d3bc4ca46fa167c8dec7ff","7b4d6e3154f72c51fde51ef1d6a9b8fff33db4ff","2bcd0b89de5ac95732fab97e0d912c31dfc9c8e6","fc41ac21596f8d2da1214f9c0fca9f4942639340","da6f1c5c512d322e21733638a5a367f2c5680141","9151d84629277bab26148bdb6379626b44e1cd0a","5f561f92ceffeff37b1782a22a19ee86ba597ce9","65056b43ea4413935148ae06ff8d8736dfdbb49d","9534cda361af19a04c4212236947c257067d5641","2a1e401a7f74da727ef4c9fbdc6e1dddfd110a28","e158ea00669155bf8614a70604f04fbb6753f447","028e76f9e168affc0774d65e7408b7822acda9c4","d452ea56b89b15e864529041751e9ec768b2ab05","b10c9865b14e0a301ac01e7b9d88d04da1943273","dda4f021cdf7264ae68743de6d55ee0bda1c5811","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c","d1afc1bac9c451642735a9d50f4f1503db7b19f8","1be14478900756780404fc7aecdcb790caede35d","5c317ca9913989d52fde8976ec2718848f1cc157","8cfe78383a0c46010a67d2d6fbc4f7793dc6404f","998056c5c6bd4c5d34b669b60fbdc84906e41984","2276b890051a7eadd85b4572e69fb8491c1efc3d","eddc2deb1dc88b61137df2877ec6970d669a8997","8b5d5b2b9b63692423f928933ffc525a8c18b20d","b84b2e796891d791c089540546095d66097d3a25","f8cf8f35d47f078fb2cd9ee179bcd68eae08ddc6"],"title":"Simple Optimal Weighting of Cases and Controls in Case-Control Studies","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1115"}

To address this, researchers often join forces by bringing multiple studies together to achieve large sample sizes, allowing for increased power in hypothesis testing, and improved efficiency in effect estimation. Combining studies, however, renders the analysis difficult owing to the presence of heterogeneity in the pooled data. In this article, motivated by a collaborative nested case-control (NCC) study of ovarian cancer in three cohorts from United States, Sweden, and Italy, we investigate the use of penalty regularized partial likelihood estimation in the context of pooled NCC studies to achieve two goals. First, we propose an adaptive group lasso (gLASSO) penalized approach to simultaneously identify important variables and estimate their effects. Second, we propose a composite agLASSO penalized approach to identify variables with heterogeneous effects. Both methods are readily implemented with the group coordinate gradient decent algorithm and shown to enjoy the oracle property. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our proposed approaches in finite samples under various heterogeneity settings, and apply them to the pooled ovarian cancer study.","inCitations":["0bca886275f904aa5f7abb9342cfb81cba4b8842"],"title":"Estimation and selection of complex covariate effects in pooled nested case-control studies with heterogeneity.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt015"}

Traditional methods of assessing QT prolongation correct the QT interval for the length of the RR interval (which varies inversely with heart-rate) in a variety of ways. These methods often disagree with each other and do not take into account changes in autonomic state. Correcting the QT interval for RR reduces a bivariate observation (RR, QT) to a univariate observation (QTc). The development of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) signal acquisition systems has made it possible to collect continuous (so called 'beat-to-beat') ECG data. ECG data collected prior to administration of a compound allow us to define a region for (RR, QT) values that encompasses typical activity. Such reference regions are used in clinical applications to define the 'normal' region of clinical or laboratory measurements. This paper motivates the need for reference regions of (RR, QT) values from beat-to-beat ECG data, and describes a way of constructing these. We introduce a measure of agreement between two reference regions that points to the reliability of 12-lead digital Holter data. We discuss the use of reference regions in establishing baselines for ECG parameters to assist in the evaluation of cardiac risk and illustrate using data from two methodological studies.","inCitations":["a53fd257da8cca7e76dabff01e6301d2b4245a3e"],"title":"Reference regions for beat-to-beat ECG data.","doi":"10.1002/pst.444"}

We describe such data with cure-mixture models, which separately model cure status and the hazard of failure among non-cured subjects. No diagnostic currently exists for evaluating the fit of such models; the popular Schoenfeld residual (Schoenfeld, 1982. Partial residuals for the proportional hazards regression-model. Biometrika 69, 239-241) is not applicable to data with cures. In this article, we propose a pseudo-residual, modeled on Schoenfeld's, to assess the fit of the survival regression in the non-cured fraction. Unlike Schoenfeld's approach, which tests the validity of the proportional hazards (PH) assumption, our method uses the full hazard and is thus also applicable to non-PH models. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the residuals and evaluate their performance by simulation in a range of parametric models. We apply our approach to data from a smoking cessation drug trial.","inCitations":["ea5a7573ecd95b469d5a1cca7c5a1922f21393b1","e34dd56526e8f0d41b429b0a7fcacaa6778fa4a1","9cbd70dcf96361606c5f0875221c80508e54aea1","58fbde4a43dfee66fbb79c74970a658aae83da4d","dff652ec0e0dbf16afb10a24fa28062e4babd2a3","1bdaea1e64f8162aeda5ee37931fe80e3f854390","5b4a683812e2155b65e8d3fe74d7fd39a13e3e04"],"title":"Assessing the fit of parametric cure models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs043"}
