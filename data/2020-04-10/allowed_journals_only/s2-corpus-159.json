Progression-free survival (PFS) has been used as a decision-making endpoint in oncology. It can be difficult to have a meaningful intent-to-treat analysis of PFS as some studies have extensive loss to follow-up for PFS. In the analysis, subjects lost to follow-up for PFS have their PFS times censored, with the censoring treated as noninformative. We use remaining overall survival to investigate whether premature censoring for PFS is informative and the potential bias in treating such censoring as noninformative.","inCitations":["ba7fcbf92afabfb2c0b77676bd3fb7fdf667fd7f"],"title":"Evaluating and adjusting for premature censoring of progression-free survival.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.813526"}

As more factors are used in the study, the search for an optimal SSD becomes increasingly challenging because of the large number of feasible selection of factor level settings. This paper tackles this discrete optimization problem via an algorithm based on swarm intelligence. Using the commonly used E(s2) criterion as an illustrative example, we propose an algorithm to find E(s2)-optimal SSDs by showing that they attain the theoretical lower bounds in Bulutoglu and Cheng (2004) and Bulutoglu (2007). We show that our algorithm consistently produces SSDs that are at least as efficient as those from the traditional CP exchange method in terms of computational effort, frequency of finding the E(s2)-optimal SSD and also has good potential for finding D3-, D4- and D5-optimal SSDs.","inCitations":["357e665b976234012301d5774b1cf9736bcc61fd","6782e76e5a42f826cf8f5179164bfd054a356160","6162d3619c13f6c25f8bf2796da526eab2766153","8ec66f1dd60039aebd283b4f8a9b213241110214","6c9ac1363186f1e38bd58846662e1c23dc929e86","84fad8918e91801cc9b2ab721b33eeccf9be15f2"],"title":"Optimizing Two-Level Supersaturated Designs Using Swarm Intelligence Techniques","doi":"10.1080/00401706.2014.981346"}

The hierarchical model, however, assumes that only the person's speed is informative of ability. This assumption of conditional independence between RT and ability given speed may be violated in practice, and ignores collateral information about ability that may be present in the residual RTs. We propose a posterior predictive check for evaluating the assumption of conditional independence between RT and ability given speed. Furthermore, we propose an extension of the hierarchical model that contains cross-loadings between ability and RT, which enables one to take additional collateral information about ability into account beyond what is possible in the standard hierarchical model. A Bayesian estimation procedure is proposed for the model. Using simulation studies, the performance of the model is evaluated in terms of parameter recovery, and the possible gain in precision over the standard hierarchical model and an RA-only model is considered. The model is applied to data from a high-stakes educational test.","inCitations":["e9d11b55f15a58a26f68984007ffa08a55c62f7d"],"title":"Improving precision of ability estimation: Getting more from response times.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12104"}

This has proven useful in cancer studies where oncogenes are activated only in a small subset of samples. We propose the outlier robust t-statistic (ORT), which is intuitively motivated from the t-statistic, the most commonly used differential gene expression detection method. Using real and simulation studies, we compare the ORT to the recently proposed cancer outlier profile analysis (Tomlins and others, 2005) and the outlier sum statistic of Tibshirani and Hastie (2006). The proposed method often has more detection power and smaller false discovery rates.

The suggestions for addressing these issues for confirmatory biopharmaceutical studies with one-sided objectives are as follows: 1. Clear documentation of the one-sided inferential posture of a study in its protocol. 2. Sufficient sample size for at least moderate power for evaluation with two-sided stringency. 3. Use of one-sided p values to express direction of results together with distinct flags for those which are suitably extreme to support inferences for the target direction or to merit description for the opposite direction. 4. Interpretation of opposite direction results in a post hoc, exploratory, descriptive way rather than inferentially. 5. Provision of one-sided confidence intervals to clarify the nature of one-sided inferences. Alternatively, for academic studies where publication with an inferential posture is of interest for either potential direction of findings, two-sided methods are typically useful. An underlying reason for this is the adjustment provided by two-sided methods for the multiplicity in the two complementary one-sided counterparts that they encompass.","inCitations":["2d030ff56f7bb0728867e0006a312bcbb17fe012","287232ad3a24e6425aac3444e99b793d9274063f","d6792787f6c55539cce6595fada318573a6c5c74","2641479eab7f4165fdbd2a219c7bfa780774efdd","d667a2b774ba026e55e98fec91d8108ca21a0717","469950b2a0898ca0becc22838ee921c05efbbef0","35ba8b1c622b1aaa4777b11c820a67a9d115ec09","7f07639878b967b13b5ede6384885032be924a72","66fd93b36f08531e93499ce09a0b46cd10b181b4"],"title":"One-sided and two-sided tests and p values.","doi":"10.1080/10543409108835014"}

The dissolution specification based on general multivariate confidence region was proposed by Chen and Tsong (8). This paper presents two alternative procedures when the dissolution profile consists of important measurements at more than 4 time points. In the first procedure, when the dissolution profile can be described by a physical curve through modeling, the dissolution specification is developed based on the confidence region of the parameters of the physical curve. In the second procedure, the principal components (PCS) as the linear combinations of the dissolution measurements are identified and dissolution specification is set based by the confidence intervals of the values of principal components. In both approaches the specification can be set at lower dimensions than the general multivariate confidence region approach. A single-stage acceptance rule can be used in both approaches by first projecting the dissolution values of each tablet in the new testing batch onto the determined parameters axes (through modeling in modeling approach and through projection on the selected PCS in principal component approach). Then check if the projections of the new tablet fall within the specifications. Finally, count the number of tablets that fall outside the specification limits and reject the batch if the proportion of out-of-specification tablet is high and accept the lot for release if the proportion is low.","inCitations":["0fef1ec5b963b35e9927af3b0f90139d657c0923","a7a6a2c9b6db35dc5c9c99c99b96e0d75fe15317","69c354c47cd461e3b0ca25d1e0063719aa759504","b6dd412356741e7aa48362b56fc1f7b1316805dd","70eee48609f408267b77aebb91f86c1c1c535d90","0432a69841b36f587a5b3f32626fe77aa61607a1","f3653b73f8f17e98f8cdea018011f8e3a6b1e0bd","ed6d258750df8544a2767e2c17ba9c0e489276cf","98039c6251e638fef67c920f089146be40b67fea","a184e28d6cc033894268e4c6903e91b6ef2d2582","0d6d3949628a1e38fe31cfe78da3a370a92ea4fe","19008245e4267f7b41430713c61609d85b2e23e3","a73e22dd9ef130a836d8110546290e821b95f3bb","11aa3b591c4e6683bb1bf1591269f1b36f4df791","428c887affe1c126d842e3f07ae2b5d501803f8a"],"title":"Multipoint dissolution specification and acceptance sampling rule based on profile modeling and principal component analysis.","doi":"10.1080/10543409708835198"}

While such data consist of non-Gaussian outcomes in a multilevel hierarchical structure, traditional analyses typically completely or partly ignore this hierarchical nature by summarizing measurements within a cluster. Non-Gaussian outcomes are often modeled using exponential family models. This is true not only for binary and count data, but also for, example, time-to-event outcomes. Two important reasons for extending this family are for (1) the possible occurrence of overdispersion, meaning that the variability in the data may not be adequately described by the models, which often exhibit a prescribed mean-variance link, and (2) the accommodation of a hierarchical structure in the data, owing to clustering in the data. The first issue is dealt with through so-called overdispersion models. Clustering is often accommodated through the inclusion of random subject-specific effects. Though not always, one conventionally assumes such random effects to be normally distributed. In the case of time-to-event data, one encounters, for example, the gamma frailty model (Duchateau and Janssen, 2007 ). While both of these issues may occur simultaneously, models combining both are uncommon. Molenberghs et al. ( 2010 ) proposed a broad class of generalized linear models accommodating overdispersion and clustering through two separate sets of random effects. Here, we use this method to model data from a comet assay with a three-level hierarchical structure. Although a conjugate gamma random effect is used for the overdispersion random effect, both gamma and normal random effects are considered for the hierarchical random effect. Apart from model formulation, we place emphasis on Bayesian estimation. Our proposed method has an upper hand over the traditional analysis in that it (1) uses the appropriate distribution stipulated in the literature; (2) deals with the complete hierarchical nature; and (3) uses all information instead of summary measures. The fit of the model to the comet assay is compared against the background of more conventional model fits. Results indicate the toxicity of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride at different dose levels (low, medium, and high).","inCitations":["c908f6b22638c7964ffcd791524bc64a7b79e3f2","5e0eed2890946df4fe7263d6b98f7db5f1eca912"],"title":"A Bayesian, generalized frailty model for comet assays.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2012.756499"}

This complaint is sometimes addressed to Bayesians (Senn, 2011), but frequentists are not exempt (Senn, 1998). (In fact, my subjective impression is that they are frequently worse.) One of the challenges I make to anybody tellingme how to do better is ‘don’t tell, do’. Unfortunately, I cannot do better than Gelman and Shalizi (2013, henceforth GS) with the examples they provide. Thus, if I am to avoid being hypocritical I have to concede that the solution is beyond (my) criticism. What I am reduced to doing is raising the hackneyed quibble, ‘it may work in practice but does itwork in theory?’. A commonclaim for Bayesian inferences is that it is a theory of everything. Clearly, however, much of what GS are doing is not covered by the standard theory of coherent Bayesian updating of prior to posterior probability statements using data. Model checking (at least) has to be added to themix. Of course, one has to be careful here; to be Bayesian means many different things to different people, and Jack Good famously determined that Bayesians came in 46,656 varieties (Good, 1983, pp. 20–21). Perhaps there is no standard theory of what it is to be Bayesian. If, however, model checking is an essential part of the (or a) Bayesian mix, it raises the question as towhat the status is of the ‘final’ analysis thatGSproduce. (For simplicity, Iwill only consider the analysis of the 2008 voting data but the argument carries over to the more complicated cases.) Consider another Bayesian, one who so firmly believed in the model that GS eventually chose that he or she had no doubts whatsoever as to its veracity. Suppose that his or her prior distribution under themodel had been the same as that of GS. The posterior ‘statement’ is now the same: can they both be valid? Well, perhaps in this case, there would be very little to choose between them in terms of validity. This is because in the end GS accepted a rather richer model. The varying intercepts model is a special case of the varying slopes model: in Bayesian terms, one might say that it corresponds to taking the random slopesmodel but having a completely informative prior that the variance of the slopes is zero.

An advantage of the composite endpoint is that, as it combines multiple endpoints to a single endpoint, it reduces or eliminates the multiplicity problem of testing multiple endpoints. In addition, accumulating evidence from individual endpoints into the composite endpoint can lead to better study power and reduce the study size and the duration of the trial. However, composite endpoints can also lead to ambiguous findings and consequently cause difficulty in interpreting study results, for example, when individual component endpoints of a composite show treatment effects in different directions. Also, multiplicity issues will arise if a study sponsor seeks efficacy claims for specific components of the composite or for a targeted subgroup of patients. This paper visits some of these issues and presents some solutions through applications of multiple testing strategies.","inCitations":["ec85d93990f5bdf41e01c207162c4848e88b32ca","77dffb92ab066da60000988cf0f1419f895653f6","eab1fddb123168976fbed00a7c74e2d956ea28ab","8be03728b323626226d6efb0d2f9fc33ca0d482c","52c324ba80b398ec27959a857445007e79baac4f","86329018e2d19074629a9546365bc81a1dd474fe","df36a95d5b75889971eaf3f82bd6ea8f3a950f27","d1278b966024cfe4bcbee9600253888b81efb879","0a731dbe67e3334e809530097f11ae85de7c5564","c658930e46c5be74e29be60310cf8849829014a4","bb14db2049fa93c922d54fbe39ac9854dae51707","b93f9ef4cf683853eb2b03fc7ca1fe3d82b4e80e","944cb90073a48efb90fadb09e54fe24c2cd7468b","749245bc20224e04a3b76b924ce4d5ea2c1795cd","095f110205133954723d6587648a800aea39d12a","290990e455d494b79ddc9f35664da6eccef83bda","7ccdabf650ec5582a6ca114e6420efb17a342658","7b18bcbca7ad7cdb20712afc5b74badc5c3f71e8","2a6fc820c05d0bd5d2a49124c47f839ac03c51f9","c7c15465bd9032c8e09934b13eff38c079d82818","91b1f873bbc1c2fc6b9165237bd26b9525c0eabc","b3ca9b82067c6bafddc58967afcfe59123837060"],"title":"Addressing multiplicity issues of a composite endpoint and its components in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.551327"}

The two randomization schemes most often used in clinical trials are considered: unstratified and centre-stratified block-permuted randomization. The prediction of the number of patients randomized to different treatment arms in different regions during the recruitment period accounting for the stochastic nature of the recruitment and effects of multiple centres is investigated. A new analytic approach using a Poisson-gamma patient recruitment model (patients arrive at different centres according to Poisson processes with rates sampled from a gamma distributed population) and its further extensions is proposed. Closed-form expressions for corresponding distributions of the predicted number of the patients randomized in different regions are derived. In the case of two treatments, the properties of the total imbalance in the number of patients on treatment arms caused by using centre-stratified randomization are investigated and for a large number of centres a normal approximation of imbalance is proved. The impact of imbalance on the power of the study is considered. It is shown that the loss of statistical power is practically negligible and can be compensated by a minor increase in sample size. The influence of patient dropout is also investigated. The impact of randomization on predicted drug supply overage is discussed.","inCitations":["3a0af392d76513af68fbf9b6b1bbdfa3ff7289b9","3a7aa9adda3aef7ea1d8f5a920be46e970228d9d","8a69f3b64f7e32b2aef112105b7b8233813b5213","09123301a28189f5ef2262827b5062d7c59afff3","067628e416dfbd4ec2ee8bd6f1c1eca3dad50610","25a070e36dbd92863e6522722c0251c82fedbc3e","7cb15b77ed6eb64258684e215ff2fe79eff36763"],"title":"Effects of unstratified and centre-stratified randomization in multi-centre clinical trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.412"}

More specifically, we test the procedure proposed by Wagenmakers, Farrell, and Ratcliff, and compare the results obtained with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayes information criterion (BIC). The present studies show that ARFIMA modelling is able to adequately detect long-range dependence in simulated fractal series. Conversely, this method tends to produce a non-negligible rate of false detections in pure autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) series. Generally, ARFIMA modelling has a bias favouring the detection of long-range dependence. AIC and BIC gave dissimilar results, due to the different weights attributed by the two criteria to accuracy and parsimony. Finally, ARFIMA modelling provides good estimates of fractal exponents, and could adequately complement classical methods, such as spectral analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis or rescaled range analysis.","inCitations":["225e64b3e2ff8ef19151890d78febe29fcef5b6e","ab89089a1a3e2882faa801205a72fa565e90fce8","ccfe3e283f7371b2e262d0cb73bcec231ebb286b","e61cfa05b7ee34ed22cd2960c78cf5842ca6ef6b","ca239d401cfedb245f5808f99c5286c3aea34c5d","2c0b54327f6e287745cac3f61ae9e6713426b0c5","01d4329533d0283407774b4d6bd32995f96d6499","6b35bb07b6f000a2be6f64132d6fb43d478966e4","ea8913c2740293fd14ea3d58f9e0b0ffa7989fca","8b2d69043589e5f66c882d7dcdba031d173c8133","f03f8b76fc99b6bdd75a345bbb2b72c231ba809e","46e24cb87e2ac9bccbedfae5b5ba25d9ab818581","f0687a7646be3a2862d95ac46d8fef23ef7744af","a8875d79a83ab0d0f4b619cb1b7da298df1cf1aa","3c475331bb3e050abf0ab606035f5fcfd581fb5c","061544efeb8a1f2278d90db91224d62cd8f68e9a","10ccc52365b2f453b1a8a4d1190b90f3cbfd49f7","99d4744ef438657f67be9db4b59d911aa575c099","df11274ef40fe157080e69386670bbdf6c616469","cdf90903e35dbbc31de92a92700ef7900d42b3a5","906d202d65b5be106f3e12f32f3df7a993472fc9","ae564773c8c0d610c73bdfc264a73204e0b00016","9de0dddfcc205c6920ef97f91249d271d1e71e2d","2cb663d22163fdc4c86d6d88281aa20550a7fb65","600fd4ddf27c258464e35d463f39791e9d753680","d900ffb4dc01340c54aef82e292bac306115b0a2","4615c0d7c2e883eec421f877f5e3cc2a20fc6598","6ed834a50266da63c51cce8e2695dee028386ed5","1fb081a5311b96dc98795c86d31c8cd345e91598","e21c5f2012695cc604a1fe053b97f2dd678a2ea5","d3b2429ef8e46066eafbc3b1398d6c450982a61b","a075cfbbe5c4c791b80e4867d76234469ea9db22","a3864398a6bd80e85ce2af00b78e7928c685df8e","5076015ab54e32cada5eaf0500cc007bf5d124b3","45ee8cfb567349aedd8343cabd99b098f99280d9","33f0fa0c569388b4e009dbf34619dca271cf67d8","44e648331d67fd3a5bbb30d94e197ada7ef0a6d1","cc3eb40484faf3ea2812045f19cb68976ff0463b","a46f4497d49b41f3a4cfea8a0a5bd6707243d374","44d821cc27f5b7076410b5d83200d6b9468eb9f5","dd80f5cab8dd3e117a20d07c63bb210f3faaeb6d","6309e479b4b17a60c4d5dd02918934d429e968ea","cbaadc39d467354db76b77d4e03c871773c9b0ad","67eec27f62f441edaf7c764fac0182e5d3948fc2","a5c49c0eb49dc9a717365f29e109dad22d2c4b2d","d648c1ca6b0350cf09dae236dbcfba6e1ddf2398","01008150f072f5239f97b16c7331dfc6b4dc3970","122bfd34d44638aa0252dca2f332b7b66af28339","c46fb754abebd0cad0f56819ec6b6abf02952486","c00ad28e7e67ea5d0938686fb7dec68e5e3feb3b","d6dbae718717bf33fdfbc55a852f5a6b638e0ee1","b646da90d0e3b005b9506b8a5585c8bdb0c89efb","1efb178b0947dc1139d02155cd5d93659439e45d","62caba90b95cb881b906af60df55c5d8c865e905","8ffe95322f8e555b98c5d45f5fcbb051f45dbb9f","f3f2e9019f4dd51316de3e52ad41ee596b432208","5669411e327108417f8925923910a0a155097f5b","f029f4257a4f9d4e6e22d913972265e294cd25f4"],"title":"Detection of long-range dependence and estimation of fractal exponents through ARFIMA modelling.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X89513"}

We discuss here methods of estimating treatment efficacy for randomized trials involving multi-treatment arms subject to non-compliance. One treatment effect of interest in the presence of non-compliance is the complier average causal effect (CACE) (Angrist et al. 1996), which is defined as the treatment effect for subjects who would comply regardless of the assigned treatment. Following the idea of principal stratification (Frangakis & Rubin 2002), we define principal compliance (Little et al. 2009) in trials with three treatment arms, extend CACE and define causal estimands of interest in this setting. In addition, we discuss structural assumptions needed for estimation of causal effects and the identifiability problem inherent in this setting from both a Bayesian and a classical statistical perspective. We propose a likelihood-based framework that models potential outcomes in this setting and a Bayes procedure for statistical inference. We compare our method with a method of moments approach proposed by Cheng & Small (2006) using a hypothetical data set, and further illustrate our approach with an application to a behavioral intervention study (Janevic et al. 2003).","inCitations":["56511e3feceb8b6a198e1ce4476fee63a6d5ceae","97f4180c905971f4ebf6fb9000b98ff90158b703","30e575fbce864be687822f79a983031fe80969ae","4d547cfbb0173f64dbdcfaab2fd8aa383f0d56fa","ac2f96af32f1158c5db28278eb28353faca06eef","81a10af6d1cd17ed65976603e916593950ab439f","16c1f36fcbf1abb32664f7c6aae7e6c2651d3ed3","8c6fe027f5ca89b37b3dd5ddf295ce99f9fa19cc","9c9ce8f34016ffb422cec215c70dab1ebd0b3554","099255bff15a8074f367b4d091f0ecb23c129329","a345207e9a2d1c8fed8ae4a325b3d2cd90d9c23c","5f8ee9cff7ecd2a083b79065e800c41f284b77ba","0da37c4e58786d937fe1046f2b3577ed50c73330"],"title":"Estimating Causal Effects in Trials Involving Multi-Treatment Arms Subject to Non-compliance: A Bayesian framework.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2009.00709.x"}

Innovations have been made on its implementation, including an adaptive-rejection-based Gibbs sampler for the stochastic E step, a proximal gradient descent algorithm for the optimization in the M step, and diagnostic procedures for determining the burn-in size and the stopping of the algorithm. These developments are based on the theoretical results of Nielsen (2000, Bernoulli, 6, 457), as well as advanced sampling and optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and virtually tuning-free, making it scalable to large-scale data with many latent traits (e.g. more than five latent traits) and easy to use for practitioners. Standard errors of parameter estimation are also obtained based on the missing-information identity (Louis, 1982, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 44, 226). The performance of the algorithm is evaluated through simulation studies and an application to the analysis of the IPIP-NEO personality inventory. Extensions of the proposed algorithm to other latent variable models are discussed.","inCitations":["01dc147043303d813d8e97651fee0b0035d7ebb6","c9f6d295736327cf907fc46b3a002ff0ff724edb"],"title":"An improved stochastic EM algorithm for large-scale full-information item factor analysis.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12153"}

Thus the measure of interest (utility) is based on dichotomized responses. We consider normally distributed correlated responses and build a utility function using the probit transform. Locally optimal designs are used as benchmarks for more practical designs such as composite and adaptive designs. We focus on D-criterion (i.e., all parameters of the dose-response model are of interest) and consider only two-stage designs. It is shown that the practice of reporting dichotomized responses leads to a substantial loss in the precision of estimated parameters (or in the power loss).","inCitations":["e3889497bb114a05b2f637284ce6ab840b6886bd","739ae908b974fe86152435aa6e46d4d70c3d16c5","a766bd9dc0bbe4f80de8e0291e8b4a49b4604d6e","10cd7f35842e4ffc79228ddd085fe8fc6630017f","e82422e1003037acb71670b1d35161c6ffc140f6","d36c64ad2177328ae04c7d35d3b5bc0232efb137","6318470e1e19c99b2f8e64e16b177a21dcf6a99c","396feb1cdc2d6e9dd865f3f2c80921c7026a1e03","d095a6b4304682f7617fb45eff60b4067559eb05","236b8d867ba5e63d0b8481258c9d7950876fa745","e60e73a0b703f844a031c6c55a2e090c62ea9dfe","c0ce236fce9c5dadda6b6154cac31e9aafaac422"],"title":"Dose finding designs for continuous responses and binary utility.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701645132"}

While there exist various item selection criteria and different asymptotically optimal designs, these are mostly constructed based on the asymptotic theory assuming the test length goes to infinity. In practice, with limited test lengths, the desired asymptotic optimality may not always apply, and there are few studies in the literature concerning the optimal design of finite items. Related questions, such as how many items we need in order to be able to identify the attribute pattern of an examinee and what types of initial items provide the optimal classification results, are still open. This paper aims to answer these questions by providing non-asymptotic theory of the optimal selection of initial items in cognitive diagnostic CAT. In particular, for the optimal design, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the Q-matrix structure of the initial items. The theoretical development is suitable for a general family of cognitive diagnostic models. The results not only provide a guideline for the design of optimal item selection procedures, but also may be applied to guide item bank construction.","inCitations":["764919d8a50aaec916362ae7b33e45997968479c","6cdc1d225523a38899d214bcb53a840cf654751a"],"title":"On initial item selection in cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12072"}

We investigate the possibility of the potential gain in power by reducing the dimensionality of the secondary variables via oracle estimators such as the Adaptive Lasso. As an application, we use a recently developed framework for score tests of association of a disease outcome with an exposure of interest in the presence of a possible interaction of the exposure with other co-factors of the model. We derive the local power of such tests and show that if the primary and secondary predictors are independent, then having an oracle estimator does not improve the local power of the score test. Conversely, if they are dependent, there is the potential for power gain. Simulations are used to validate the theoretical results and explore the extent of correlation needed between the primary and secondary covariates to observe an improvement of the power of the test by using the oracle estimator. Our conclusions are likely to hold more generally beyond the model of interactions considered here.","inCitations":["814bc5192ee0f7c5665b973e03c75387ad84316e","af06ee87e0d456391eac61e710f9657583906c1d","36737c55eb1ea68790584d6b55d88103c30265a0","8e245accda88bba02b91e56e16a68a6dee6c461d","96d0911ddf93e0fb9e08fa44c25c9b29b647b671"],"title":"A Note on the Effect on Power of Score Tests via Dimension Reduction by Penalized Regression under the Null","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1231"}

As implemented, it is not robust to outliers and bad data. Several robust methods in model fitting and testing are proposed. These include direct estimation of M-estimators of structured parameters and a two-stage procedure based on robust M- and S-estimators of population covariances. The large sample properties of these estimators are obtained. The equivalence between a direct M-estimator and a two-stage estimator based on an M-estimator of population covariance is established when sampling from an elliptical distribution. Two test statistics are presented in judging the adequacy of a hypothesized model; both are asymptotically distribution free if using distribution free weight matrices. So these test statistics possess both finite sample and large sample robustness. The two-stage procedures can be easily adapted into standard software packages by modifying existing asymptotically distribution free procedures. To demonstrate the two-stage procedure, S-estimator and M-estimators under different weight functions are calculated for some real data sets.","inCitations":["2d5559ebe0a26a22e797bcf082c0c23bd8297746","0723746688610074214b9c6fe9c22f7c9af7b572","231a5015d28b063f9296f9727baab60dbef4ac5b","58bd9c1715c3f96bbfb733be9455f292ab7b468f","34d9c1267ff1c5b16da49758024dc6b9cf069b10","53bee0858170dc871eb452fdfa2fb2d040a5ba0a","9634c1f244d35a538983e9a070020924f9f86ed8","810cb842cdf2e0c471efc5e9004b2eb666bec8c7","1627f888569e63596e9b2338560c06afbff6ad80","47af2a03d4dabaccc8700042c6ba40070afb6681","0419bd2df13cdda59b253058513a35c0f40caff5","00ca70b29e3f23b74f7c438cc00a84edbb4039ec","c6078b39942b293c8cc0f92f76ecbf4d2cc953fc","dd5e1f5ab70ff2f9b77c87ec46e16c0d8118eb58","9163772cfaefa46691d6760cbf745d22e91537de","2768ea90a1926dfdc452b71277aafe7953044720","8d63160919742055ba468d28a69aad22e331b636","f790ee904a95b41297628d8049defbb80a3919c4","41b28814cd2598a2a724f2929df0fb284dee77fe","f1d1ee7e752a40d5c260cd798d91d7c7e5bb1950","25ca17a76b94c14f89284337425a0e839add812d","0963e2cfca95040a57e96933ada3f9f8c2196ae6","f56933eaa0ce15d198a8a06ea8150fcea8689606","56f7dd338ca6beb914a458a2de3583ef82e60d70","fe68a6257bd1a95e8203eefb9471c0e5ff095050","daa3ddbbcb9ab41582650f175be600523f92be40","423e4340d88b55bc86a121b2bcba8d1f2cd844e0","2c9cbd71926e486be2a09a0ca1535526669568e9","4353e51af1c2d04b8063b5ed8d817380f7ab2298","250e40697f2287458ca97d10ef47b171c7365224","1f18aaeeb32b3d28a5505a9ea6e2834647e728d8","1d063155d28ef755de3d41a1c3067ff4714a1cad","977d30042cedb11dbe5cf2399aa024f629ebb4da","6d0cc1ef76f0d492f94c7730c65ff99402d6cc06","85ef6ad9edb266b984f7e185db3653ff81ef5027","002d6623a263900ba4807b21122769b52486d877","7f1b34da751e1fc416af2d9b6cd0b1e87f5df43a","a85f00149747a01d8239c61dfc1b820223a5d0bf","faf63349439c31171633d6a975902ca8cd27c7fe","6267559080b6d0a2879e95350332a060e9652a44","fc76ce2d44adef80b38cf972b1a67079d1b95760","5e94e3df76d30b4007bdfb10a887778588c55a6b","36474681f8f506f944907c83bee04e1e336edb17","41894ea8f3b6638d7d7c14acd171ea9500b149ea","51da5479ca861872e16eeb8786a82717ed9cd7e4","03ba8a8376a46887db88507616d1b243d3338824","46ffabc5fa3012ab9c7413efa5ce144d2b7ba7d8","236f151ba111c689c58b2ad400f50199c7e08e29","af7fa7091c2b397f859c708933f36d81022cd213"],"title":"Robust mean and covariance structure analysis.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1998.tb00667.x"}
