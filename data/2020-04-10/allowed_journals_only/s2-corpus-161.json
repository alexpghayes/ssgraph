When data consists of multiple groups, it is often assumed the covariance matrices are either equal across groups or are completely distinct. We seek methodology to allow borrowing of strength across potentially similar groups to improve estimation. To that end, we introduce a covariance partition prior which proposes a partition of the groups at each measurement time. Groups in the same set of the partition share dependence parameters for the distribution of the current measurement given the preceding ones, and the sequence of partitions is modeled as a Markov chain to encourage similar structure at nearby measurement times. This approach additionally encourages a lower-dimensional structure of the covariance matrices by shrinking the parameters of the Cholesky decomposition toward zero. We demonstrate the performance of our model through two simulation studies and the analysis of data from a depression study.

Individual causal method effects, due to heterogeneity of the measurement methods, account for the imperfect correlation of the true-score variables at each time of measurement.

Failure to reject the null hypothesis of traditional hypothesis tests such as the ANOVA F-test (i.e., H0 : μ(1) = ... = μ(k)) does not imply the equivalence of the population means. Researchers interested in determining the equivalence of k independent groups should apply a one-way test of equivalence (e.g., Wellek, 2003). The goals of this study were to investigate the robustness of the one-way Wellek test of equivalence to violations of homogeneity of variance assumption, and compare the Type I error rates and power of the Wellek test with a heteroscedastic version which was based on the logic of the one-way Welch (1951) F-test. The results indicate that the proposed Wellek-Welch test was insensitive to violations of the homogeneity of variance assumption, whereas the original Wellek test was not appropriate when the population variances were not equal.","inCitations":["946def0d9b9761499601ad69e4d99b3ec3dbfd7f","f700f1714e4e13c3dcf222bf2d9dc25fb4b48930","9adedfeabc30c0d0987852bf165363001e407217","05d59abe310d71b584203a9758280fa29de85e30","f10f87cdda77ebbf0c3d3a555923ac5cc2fe2df9"],"title":"Robust tests of equivalence for k independent groups.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02056.x"}

Currently, 2 statistical approaches are available for estimating conception probabilities depending upon the research question and extent of data collection during the menstrual cycle: a survival approach when interested in modeling time-to-pregnancy (TTP) in relation to women or couples' purported exposure(s), or a hierarchical Bayesian approach when one is interested in modeling day-specific conception probabilities during the estimated fertile window. We propose a biologically valid discrete survival model that unifies the above 2 approaches while relaxing some assumptions that may not be consistent with human reproduction or behavior. This approach combines both the survival and the hierarchical models allowing investigators to obtain the distribution of TTP and day-specific probabilities during the fertile window in a single model. Our model allows for the consideration of covariate effects at both the cycle and the daily level while accounting for daily variation in conception. We conduct extensive simulations and utilize the New York State Angler Prospective Pregnancy Cohort Study to illustrate our approach. We also provide the code to implement the model in R software in the supplemental section of the supplementary material available at Biostatistics online.","inCitations":["7f7a245a651052b6bda64610c5e52e67b0d9ca16","17883e0b4e9d7310a740fff52407e219faa5f242","41dfa8b66786fce3708a0e5642346b73e5d47fdf","89ea268b7e33d88724d5e8791760ce79c314a214","e3a2765b7bdf615aeced1adb06ebe585c60a19ac","81d762b3a3e4d89be882e3ceb05add966f97a85f","524345975e77f2d84c5f144c600941760c9e8866"],"title":"A survival analysis approach to modeling human fecundity.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr015"}

The age at PHV is often derived from growth models such as the triple logistic fitted to the stature (height) data. Theoretically, for a well behaved growth function, age at PHV could be obtained by setting the second derivative of the growth function to zero and solving for age. Such a solution obviously depends on the parameters of the growth function. Therefore, the uncertainty in the estimation of age at PHV resulting from the uncertainty in the estimation of the growth model, need to be accounted for in the models in which it is used as a predictor. Explicit expressions for the age at PHV and consequently the variance of the estimate of the age at PHV do not exist for some of the commonly used non-linear growth functions, such as the triple logistic function. Once an estimate of this variance is obtained, it could be incorporated in subsequent modeling either through measurement error models or by using the variances as weights. A numerical method for estimating the variance is implemented. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated through comparisons in models where explicit solution for the variance exists. The method of estimating the variance is illustrated by applying to growth data from the Fels study and subsequently used as weights in modeling two adulthood outcomes from the same study.","inCitations":["805ae089fb4e546fbe37279d3c15ec10beba2419"],"title":"A Numerical Method for Estimating the Variance of Age at Maximum Growth Rate in Growth Models.","doi":"10.1080/03610926.2011.588368"}

The Copas selection model provides a flexible framework for correcting estimates and offers considerable insight into the publication bias. However, maximizing the observed likelihood under the Copas selection model is challenging because the observed data contain very little information on the latent variable. In this article, we study a Copas-like selection model and propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimation based on the full likelihood. Empirical simulation studies show that the EM algorithm and its associated inferential procedure performs well and avoids the non-convergence problem when maximizing the observed likelihood.","inCitations":["c8f6a7514ee4fcd81df18361ff6e5e28de0315d2"],"title":"Maximum likelihood estimation and EM algorithm of Copas-like selection model for publication bias correction.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx004"}

This allows the combination of trials from different clinical phases of a drug development process. Such combinations require designs where hypotheses are selected and/or added at interim analysis without knowing the selection rule in advance so that both flexibility and multiplicity issues arise. The paper reviews the basic principles and some of the common methods for reaching flexibility while controlling the family-wise error rate in the strong sense. Flexible designs have been criticized because they may lead to different weights for the patients from the different stages when reassessing sample sizes. Analyzing the data in a conventional way avoids such unequal weighting but may inflate the multiple type I error rate. In cases where the conditional type I error rates of the new design (and conventional analysis) are below the conditional type I error rates of the initial design the conventional analysis may, however, be done without inflating the type I error rate.

We propose an iterative algorithm for obtaining regression and transformation parameters from estimating equations, utilizing existing software for GEE problems. The algorithmic technique is closely related to that used in the Box-Tidwell transformation in classical linear regression, but we develop it under the GEE setting and for more general transformation functions. We provide supporting theorems for consistency and asymptotic Normality of the estimates. Inference between two nested models is also considered. This methodology is applied to two data sets. One consists of pill dissolution data, the other is taken from the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS). The PYS is a prospective longitudinal study of the development of delinquency, substance use, and mental health in male youth. We use the model-based parametric approach to examine the association between alcohol use at an early stage of adolescent development and delinquency over the course of adolescence.","inCitations":["06144cb9d8cce367f3523e5a33396f1a9d2d2dbc","30aad921a25b5da7efcbf29bd15c0f9b5838e15f","6fda0e521427ec2ece41c3a50d43484d0d143abc","90f52933b7e5f39dbd0c393fe392accce2a2b676","ddce95a12ba0ffc763617f4a92c9c5d5ddc66673"],"title":"Transformations of covariates for longitudinal data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.3.353"}

In the regression context, online updating algorithms assume that the set of predictor variables does not change, and consequently cannot incorporate new variables that may become available midway through the data stream. A naive approach would be to discard all previous information and start updating with new variables from scratch. We propose a method that utilizes the information from earlier data in the online updating algorithm with bias corrections to improve efficiency. The method is developed for linear models first, and then extended to estimating equations for generalized linear models. Closed-form expressions for the efficiency gain over the naive approach are derived in a particular linear model setting. We compare the performance of our proposed bias-correcting approach and the naive approach in simulation studies with data generated from a normal linear model and a logistic regression model. The method is applied to a study on airline delay, where reasons for delays were only available more recently, starting in 2003.","inCitations":["e89af1f422769b211b963132a9bcd0c804b4f506","0be9c023ff77e16ccc25c000249bc13af47aae8e"],"title":"Online updating method with new variables for big data streams.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.11330"}

The more flexible framework is achieved through introducing novel parameterizations of the model, giving varying degrees of parsimony, using exponential family models whose structure may be exploited in various theoretical and algorithmic ways. The algorithms are based on variational generalized EM algorithms, where the E-steps are augmented by a minorization-maximization (MM) idea. The bootstrapped standard error estimates are based on an efficient Monte Carlo network simulation idea.

Based on past research and on findings from their own extensive simulation study, which covered a wide range of balanced normal homoscedastic situations, Tamhane et al. recommended a procedure they called SD2L, since it exhibited good performance in almost all the situations they studied. This method is a step-down procedure with a simple linear contrast-based trend test at each step. In this paper, we demonstrate that replacing the linear contrast trend test by Bartholomew's test leads to a procedure, SD2B, that consistently outperforms SD2L. In addition to the balanced normal homoscedastic framework, the finite sample performance of these procedures is also explored under unbalanced and/or heteroscedastic conditions. A third procedure, SD2W, which replaces the linear contrast test by Welch's test, offers some improvement over SD2B in a few heteroscedastic situations. In many cases, the increase in efficiency of SD2B and SD2W over SD2L exceeds 10%.","inCitations":["a77d4cc37e35e2aff87426b59b65179355b4d432"],"title":"Step-down trend tests for identifying the minimum effective dose.","doi":"10.1080/10543409808835228"}

A current draft guideline by the EMA discusses potentials and problems in subgroup analyses and formulated challenges to the development of appropriate statistical procedures for the data-driven identification of patient subgroups. We introduce model-based recursive partitioning as a procedure for the automated detection of patient subgroups that are identifiable by predictive factors. The method starts with a model for the overall treatment effect as defined for the primary analysis in the study protocol and uses measures for detecting parameter instabilities in this treatment effect. The procedure produces a segmented model with differential treatment parameters corresponding to each patient subgroup. The subgroups are linked to predictive factors by means of a decision tree. The method is applied to the search for subgroups of patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that differ with respect to their Riluzole treatment effect, the only currently approved drug for this disease.","inCitations":["b594f37763cb2b344854ded6051e4c82958ccdcd","3965fe5748cecf6ef98c2c893726d7bc2eda4c40","bad206c7d8f27c12d6bf2a399a6b7fc31d279956","4d9d937b73edf38d28c0a8429bd13dfc9e94739e","f0295f2ac5060e277787c401b657c33973eeff5e","784935d5064abc46ee1e7e8dc168dcb62ff777d5","59af6b1b2a7b1fc468472c2122fe32a1b849b96a","473f456c30679f2394acd72c7aee13c83d1b2989","f65910ffbe4c572ad65c1d39e39baaf2637ea9d3","d38981b2dcf96e25927b297e5d46acdc03afe34e","e5463bc67686795e8020754110e6f608f8e6bcb7","c44e662bdeab4fe63e6398d3f63880cc88a7ddfd","9b393132e4c7766f52d8916a9845261b5674f924","ce9dbcbde4543559b7e4dccf412022d4874bcd84","9a761e4cb85ba6df5e2f927cf51942e6f6b9a02c","9d19822622c192fb214227397b6b7065c35a5ade","ef8281890be74f1cc210783fcd52149e05e0d3f4","9fd3ddc85857e356a5fed7960563c3eb6d87e188","e501bcc759c2740065489f948d00e37eb6bab176","86e12a38ff7fdbc7617e9537db32248403ab150d","b33cfc21c50fb689aea26bc8c89883b105abdcd2","fd836e39c289f8a0823711317e861d6b10018670","d03b582c6679feff7db6976a77bbd63f544a9307","6c2f0e2c96df5c153248a6db861a1212c11d4fca","2c8c61ad9f902099e55abe94e61e56e473c7a37c","9c50a9ba3965142a71d4d8ded61de636a7669128","e8faa1943efa102db9da98667fb8782fa9c71908","71613a7261313fc9dc7c6f8b30333717226805d7","7c31849b7fd25c9b0c2cafad4b7236ddfa2dedd5","ae521ccd4d14f50687e1af94d4e36853239d7353","9244119d9663ec20e15714308a18f176cdbe41a1","5e10297c46648f91cd9ebdc007d96aa5b244b29a","db827d6eb294055f72d7c5f1cb10707637521430","bcf54b4e4d07228350b7ee48129d396d42027bfe","1c334865e58adc66461e8c6561a657ac837f4548","160a6328471ea47661203e9f2d6c5ef2b5d9fdfa"],"title":"Model-Based Recursive Partitioning for Subgroup Analyses","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2015-0032"}

In addition, for normal data, this paper also proposes the coverage probability (CP) and total deviation index (TDI). Those indices are used to measure intra, inter and total agreement among all raters. Intra-rater indices are used to measure the agreement among the multiple readings from the same rater. Inter-rater indices are used to measure the agreement among different raters based on the average of multiple readings. Total-rater indices are used to measure the agreement among different raters based on individual readings. In addition to the agreement, the paper also assess intra, inter, and total precision and accuracy. Through a two-way mixed model, all CCC, precision and accuracy, TDI, and CP indices are expressed as functions of variance components, and GEE method is used to obtain the estimates and perform inferences for all the functions of variance components. Each of previous proposed approaches for assessing agreement becomes one of the special case of the proposed approach. For continuous data, when m approaches infinity, the proposed estimates reduce to the agreement indices proposed by Barnhart et al. (2005). When m = 1, the proposed estimate reduces to the ICC proposed by Carrasco and Jover (2003). When m = 1, the proposed estimate also reduces to the OCCC proposed by Lin (1989), King and Chinchilli (2001a) and Barnhart et al. (2002). When m = 1 and k = 2, the proposed estimate reduces to the original CCC proposed by Lin (1989). For categorical data, when k = 2 and m = 1, the proposed estimate and its associated inference reduce to the kappa for binary data and weighted kappa with squared weight for ordinal data.","inCitations":["a97ecf59f942f85b1a5a070f3336d8a18648d19c","da41c886363fde13d065ece150a631d960803902","92f6feb87cb5b5b02d7d2e66c11e860a44e6b5de","610330b0013b95364bfeb4c0703bd87140aa3814","5b578ad0548028aaddd6b18d426e1859ac936830","ddfc9e436a219112a832f7ed9183ce4cf72dfc9c","e72bf1cf4a12fa8d2e1c75c9843b5fb320ca65b6","333bacc23b717d745903c256dad1ca1669cc56e5","c59f9b9cf27911cf3b613bbf6e5cd1a42e5d10d3","38f48180e8dcff7f4362be0334b14d3d2e27ebf1","2643f69c576d6d8db6cfc82e33713878a0eb8d30","4354623f2adb44a7e2977721ccc71eb41c5627ae","00bfac2e71ca84fbe0519b9953137151526d4bc8","686f3e5b17348d4a8a12cedc0c28f1d1a556e96e","1a8248d653cd8e010cc39ac4245495d346007f5b","d563c37b179bcfbd6d54ff3e7afbdb2009246482","6e5c130842746de9287e551d2fb03d0d8bd69a50","53314e2edf158ac66ae76fe3b92e5ce6a039ea3b","c633b4332b5f59bc51d9bb2e2a883cdb0f8a2058","436bc7ea94056defc14c38e93f19c5bdb85dac0b","add42a35feda192b5dbaf2e3a180961c320c5a85","85ad76ce82a8bdb35699ad77e23552961ead52bd","7f498f672d97dfb76b358a1f3745d5cb448e70c2","3ad26d0ec3c4b1f92dbc970d1ac6a51a9bb7f5f2","f6aa2b0e9155c59c39562a942cfee8c7218d0961","ba3d2dd10deee3429235681ccd7169dad5ad09b6","68aed13f98e3d02fdf5f297052599c2922d36b72","432455018e750e4cee6b78af7ea237eb291ff892","f4175133ce8127797bdc1341c52322b181e58c11","f05d6ebca3704f9177f430075dd62da344c57d92","b0f84fe1f91dd7d5025e09c9bc6a42eb7983d7a1","87e0aa2d1033a8afc3bd3d401034b9276ffc037d","ec3f54928a3b3617a0fc1775849a35ea313d3e61","378e3e71bc3f2c6cc5af891c91d2f8d65086f363","70b7088308f6fca32915a87f42534d2ddc111de6"],"title":"A unified approach for assessing agreement for continuous and categorical data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701376498"}
