If the prior information is specified correctly, in the sense that those null hypotheses considered most likely to be false in fact are false, the power of our method is substantially greater than that of standard frequentist approaches.

However, as some concerns about the clinical relevance as well as the interpretation of such composite endpoints have been raised, it is recommended to evaluate the composite endpoint jointly with the involved components. We propose an approach for carrying out simultaneous inference based on separate model fits for each endpoint, yet controlling the familywise type I error rate asymptotically. The key idea is to stack parameter estimates from the different fits and derive their joint asymptotic distribution. Simulations show that the proposed approach comes closer to nominal levels and has comparable or higher power as compared to existing approaches, even for moderate sample sizes (around 100-200 observations). The method is compared to the gatekeeping approach and results are provided in the Supplementary Material. In two data examples we show how the procedure may be adapted to handle local significance levels specified through a priori given weights.","inCitations":["c2e320586c483e4347cf23b82a3725396a321965"],"title":"Simultaneous inference of a binary composite endpoint and its components.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1148704"}

The aim of this paper is to develop a multiscale adaptive smoothing model (MASM) in the frequency domain by integrating the spatial and temporal information to adaptively and accurately estimate HRFs pertaining to each stimulus sequence across all voxels in a three-dimensional (3D) volume. We use two sets of simulation studies and a real data set to examine the finite sample performance of MASM in estimating HRFs. Our real and simulated data analyses confirm that MASM outperforms several other state-of-art methods, such as the smooth finite impulse response (sFIR) model.","inCitations":["67c20f27189539984b770fba465a8587ac381839","fd8ff3b2b9ff264a313d7dce3adf0974aeb03256","8fbdaf83ad45d027faa0beb6c3bc6ee1eeff9c54","8092fd81b0c12f076a89dcd38548668976cbe373","4fbb212d0b7a306cb609328c51da2455f056b024","f7071b580b60c6e6e0283e195e2cd7f369cd4c7b","9b81472d3ee628be435cb754d5a3066f8665bd53","3b78f0acf4d7d8209818eb01e659427fef7aaa63"],"title":"Multiscale Adaptive Smoothing Models for the Hemodynamic Response Function in Fmri.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS609"}

Some PK parameters are estimated in order to summarize the complete drug's kinetic profile: area under the curve (AUC), maximal concentration (C(max)), time at which the maximal concentration occurs (t(max)) and half-life time (t(1/2)).Several methods have been proposed to estimate these PK parameters. A first method relies on interpolating between observed concentrations. The interpolation method is often chosen linear. This method is simple and fast. Another method relies on compartmental modelling. In this case, nonlinear methods are used to estimate parameters of a chosen compartmental model. This method provides generally good results. However, if the data are sparse and noisy, two difficulties can arise with this method. The first one is related to the choice of the suitable compartmental model given the small number of data available in preclinical experiment for instance. Second, nonlinear methods can fail to converge. Much work has been done recently to circumvent these problems (J. Pharmacokinet. Pharmacodyn. 2007; 34:229-249, Stat. Comput., to appear, Biometrical J., to appear, ESAIM P&S 2004; 8:115-131).In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model based on P-splines. This method provides good PK parameters estimation, whatever be the number of available observations and the level of noise in the data. Simulations show that the proposed method provides better PK parameters estimations than the interpolation method, both in terms of bias and precision. The Bayesian nonparametric method provides also better AUC and t(1/2) estimations than a correctly specified compartmental model, whereas this last method performs better in t(max) and C(max) estimations.We extend the basic model to a hierarchical one that treats the case where we have concentrations from different subjects. We are then able to get individual PK parameter estimations. Finally, with Bayesian methods, we can get easily some uncertainty measures by obtaining credibility sets for each PK parameter.","inCitations":["64910acabcf45c249a72050b205ae5fee3704c82"],"title":"Pharmacokinetic parameters estimation using adaptive Bayesian P-splines models.","doi":"10.1002/pst.336"}

In a frailty model, the latent frailties shared by members within a cluster are assumed to act multiplicatively on the hazard function. In order to obtain parameter and frailty variate estimates, we consider the hierarchical likelihood (H-likelihood) approach (Ha, Lee and Song, 2001. Hierarchical-likelihood approach for frailty models. Biometrika 88, 233-243) in which the latent frailties are treated as \"parameters\" and estimated jointly with other parameters of interest. We find that the H-likelihood estimators perform well when the censoring rate is low, however, they are substantially biased when the censoring rate is moderate to high. In this paper, we propose a simple and easy-to-implement bias correction method for the H-likelihood estimators under a shared frailty model. We also extend the method to a multivariate frailty model, which incorporates complex dependence structure within clusters. We conduct an extensive simulation study and show that the proposed approach performs very well for censoring rates as high as 80%. We also illustrate the method with a breast cancer data set. Since the H-likelihood is the same as the penalized likelihood function, the proposed bias correction method is also applicable to the penalized likelihood estimators.","inCitations":["394d95996f87c3a5368c0284d07e4e392103ec63"],"title":"Bias correction in the hierarchical likelihood approach to the analysis of multivariate survival data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr040"}

Conventionally, the goal of a Phase I trial is to find the maximum tolerated combination (MTC). However, in trials involving an immunotherapy, it is also essential to test whether a difference in toxicities associated with the MTC and the standard of care alone is present. This information can give useful insights about the interaction of the compounds and can provide a quantification of the additional toxicity burden and therapeutic index. We show that both, testing for difference between toxicity risks and selecting MTC can be achieved using a Bayesian model-based dose-escalation design with two modifications. Firstly, the standard of care administrated alone is included in the trial as a control arm and each patient is randomized between the control arm and one of the combinations selected by a model-based design. Secondly, a flexible model is used to allow for toxicities at the MTC and the control arm to be modeled directly. We compare the performance of two-parameter and four-parameter logistic models with and without randomization to a current standard of such trials: a one-parameter model. It is found that at the cost of a small reduction in the proportion of correct selections in some scenarios, randomization provides a significant improvement in the ability to test for a difference in the toxicity risks. It also allows a better fitting of the combination-toxicity curve that leads to more reliable recommendations of the combination(s) to be studied in subsequent phases.","inCitations":["c5421723a3e4d6bffd355a27c661708a2fc88f11","5cb59102767f64bad19b2206d10550dbe569fb93","8f9f3c99f742c878f28a3170b08c9dcbc5266ef6","8f68ff6d37c52217d9a1158442bf0526ec198c2e"],"title":"Randomized dose-escalation designs for drug combination cancer trials with immunotherapy.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2018.1535503"}

In previous work, an approximation for this inflation that results in a corrected version of the sandwich formula for the covariance matrix of regression parameter estimates was derived. Use of this correction for correlation structure selection also reduces the over-selection of the unstructured working correlation matrix. In this manuscript, we conduct a simulation study to demonstrate that an increase in variances of regression parameter estimates can occur when GEE incorporates structured working correlation matrices as well. Correspondingly, we show the ability of the corrected version of the sandwich formula to improve the validity of inference and correlation structure selection. We also study the relative influences of two popular corrections to a different source of bias in the empirical sandwich covariance estimator.","inCitations":["17a7a5a9efbc8b447861ccbcb4a802e6d4b043f1","0486aea56ca262b1e58c7ce6bd6da5372686e114","3fe475520f739b00e7cf85d36475fb5073579cc2","37e6a22322c3748b4daac070b0db42bd0e5a0dc7","31846daa64e81e99e3c6801fdd76b21c7024bb69","9ca4bf7eb0b4b06d3c00813fcbbdc1240b77ba25","b2025554a2d323be36a8e405d079c53a26516eb7"],"title":"A covariance correction that accounts for correlation estimation to improve finite-sample inference with generalized estimating equations: A study on its applicability with structured correlation matrices.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2015.1089873"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2006,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In the analyses of incomplete longitudinal clinical trial data, there has been a shift, away from simple ad hoc methods that are valid only if the data are missing completely at random (MCAR), to more principled (likelihood-based or Bayesian) ignorable analyses, which are valid under the less restrictive missing at random (MAR) assumption. The availability of the necessary standard statistical software allows for such analyses in practice. Although the possibility of data missing not at random (MNAR) cannot be ruled out, it is argued that analyses valid under MNAR are not well suited for the primary analysis in clinical trials. Therefore, rather than either forgetting about or blindly shifting to an MNAR framework, the optimal place for MNAR analyses is within a sensitivity analysis context. Such analyses can be used, for example, to assess how sensitive results from an ignorable analysis are to possible departures from MAR and how much results are affected by influential observations. In this article, we apply the local influence sensitivity tool (Verbeke et al., 2001) to a longitudinal depression trial, thereby applying it to continuous outcomes from clinical trials.","inCitations":["a974ba56421bbdc363f242e810a4c5fd39e7d5fa","e6d07ac6c93d417b5a8827c5ecc438bf3937a15a","2acfb111f0796767b65b0deed1fbab4f3e6983ba","ab1b944c1eb0f5b2ba1094e8a0c9f8e501fc22ec","c015f310785b59c90d1a742076d12fbf4b5c6d72","c2624a54c77c4914683ce6bcca0aac808c7bb1cc","f506faf983c31cbdf8aea2b8e942e12bd5920521","6fb88b86446e038dfb8d37a1b464a19c30260060","d8a0a3ad4df33fc761486e2c6a54eea355f6b374","66d64209c0a987739438a03dde1deaa41233c87d"],"title":"A local influence sensitivity analysis for incomplete longitudinal depression data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600609510"}

The probability of statistical success (PoSS) of the phase III trials based on data from earlier studies is an important factor in that decision-making process. Instead of statistical power, the predictive power of a phase III trial, which takes into account the uncertainty in the estimation of treatment effect from earlier studies, has been proposed to evaluate the PoSS of a single trial. However, regulatory authorities generally require statistical significance in two (or more) trials for marketing licensure. We show that the predictive statistics of two future trials are statistically correlated through use of the common observed data from earlier studies. Thus, the joint predictive power should not be evaluated as a simplistic product of the predictive powers of the individual trials. We develop the relevant formulae for the appropriate evaluation of the joint predictive power and provide numerical examples. Our methodology is further extended to the more complex phase III development scenario comprising more than two (K > 2) trials, that is, the evaluation of the PoSS of at least k₀ (k₀≤ K) trials from a program of K total trials.","inCitations":["37b93852ddc0b2bd6b8533bfc2032af0c5bc6c27"],"title":"Joint probability of statistical success of multiple phase III trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1597"}

An intervention programme for managing asthma was designed on principles of self-regulation and was evaluated by a randomized longitudinal study.The study focused on several outcomes, and, typically, missing data remained a pervasive problem. We develop a pattern-mixture model to evaluate the outcome of intervention on the number of hospitalizations with non-ignorable dropouts. Pattern-mixture models are not generally identifiable as no data may be available to estimate a number of model parameters. Sensitivity analyses are performed by imposing structures on the unidentified parameters.We propose a parameterization which permits sensitivity analyses on clustered longitudinal count data that have missing values due to non-ignorable missing data mechanisms. This parameterization is expressed as ratios between event rates across missing data patterns and the observed data pattern and thus measures departures from an ignorable missing data mechanism. Sensitivity analyses are performed within a Bayesian framework by averaging over different prior distributions on the event ratios. This model has the advantage of providing an intuitive and flexible framework for incorporating the uncertainty of the missing data mechanism in the final analysis.","inCitations":["f8e2c0aeb23e61b15d96f4d35dc7618724f9aa14","b6899a0ce1ce4cc7a010277446863e06ec779394","05ba1a835193faa96d54b5f3f3733e98740f25ee","1c5477dd85b545d3e5dfa535eb4c71595a9130ec","a1e8cc64e3f3a7ccf2dbd57b3fa7c821ab83d736","84ee68f7ede6b24ccda6bb51e7adf4e11f0deded","dffa462e23bd37e1a61b8c09751164dddaacf931","a65120c5715ad96c560b7b563a48bcb5939950ff","09e64df8009a1a0e933c1cd4e6b4215999926142","acf15d7d4d8f13952efd0f0781d4d40dcb6ac2ef","9748f85c693edd14f589be75e37b612dadf14abc","44eb91a978ea03ae91d0f95849de6ffc995254ef"],"title":"A Bayesian model for longitudinal count data with non-ignorable dropout.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00628.x"}

We challenge this response format and argue that response confidence also plays an important role in the construction of PFs, and thus should have some impact on threshold estimation. We motivate the discussion by adopting a three-state threshold theory for response confidence proposed by Krantz (1969, Psychol. Rev., 76, 308-324), which is a modification of Luce's (1963, Psychol. Rev., 70, 61-79) low-threshold theory. In particular, we discuss the case in which the practice of averaging over order (or position) is enforced in data collection. Finally, we illustrate the fit of the Luce-Krantz model to data from a line-discrimination task with response confidence.","inCitations":["084f7eade81c3d5f63dc1b77be842eda692383fe"],"title":"A threshold theory account of psychometric functions with response confidence under the balance condition.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12040"}

However, standard inference methods (e.g. restricted maximum likelihood estimation) usually underestimate statistical errors and possibly provide highly overconfident results under realistic situations; for instance, coverage probabilities of confidence intervals can be substantially below the nominal level. The main reason is that these inference methods rely on large sample approximations even though the number of synthesized studies is usually small or moderate in practice. In this article, we solve this problem using a unified inference method based on Monte Carlo conditioning for broad application to random effects meta-analysis. The developed method provides improved confidence intervals with coverage probabilities that are closer to the nominal level than standard methods. As specific applications, we provide new inference procedures for three types of meta-analysis: conventional univariate meta-analysis for pairwise treatment comparisons, meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy, and multiple treatment comparisons via network meta-analysis. We also illustrate the practical effectiveness of these methods via real data applications and simulation studies.","inCitations":["c9fa137046d9884c1d1918153aef469edfc79cd4"],"title":"A unified method for improved inference in random effects meta-analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz020"}

In particular, three different designs of the modified up-and-down approach based on the combination of experiments on one test space and reduced test space are investigated. The standard normal distribution and chi-square distribution are used as tolerance distributions. Simulation results indicate that the modified up-and-down method tends to be somewhat better than the original up-and-down method in terms of the mean squared error under normal tolerance distribution. In case of chi-square distribution, the modified method is shown to be substantially better when the test space is wide and the initial dose is further away from the LD50.","inCitations":["c828cef927426356c63de26edcf0971df556a289","e1fca47f77ac4f2f31c885ff306f13dba9639ad9","8c323acee9860d5f7bb3488350a80dca730b9296","1407759e7c7e28a978add5158dfca0ee4fe9cac3","1eb8520abb21cb239de6165115dadadb730d45a6","c0bed464718676d0891a25bb2515bd703f0419bc","738eb0f465861e2065299f1550032d424560a7cd","08c3076b7824eea5c692cf0c14354305ba383454","3572292c99dfb7a34f1217bdf00bbf9901e3ff76","c1e84c73cc1158394936d0dfcd33c90b2975e477","2719407ddbb9d36704b8fab37ff92fe3d6ab7188","5a806e2f61a5761a7210c32636c2b17804ddee44","9b6e765a31fa1bf90cea19417fc5dddb5c690ae2","0b9a492c56fa013a325d736ca19fceeece7d8105","19b652ec261a1c4e76f1366960f86c295833d662","a1e493ade4965414c8ad892e116674f606c8238b","9fd056f958a9e2a5c9388b933bdf58d30969e2df","15f7b1d8456511543af3eb1d52cee1045c8bae7d"],"title":"Sequential method of estimating the LD50 using a modified up-and-down rule.","doi":"10.1080/10543409408835069"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2013,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"The objective of this research was to demonstrate a framework for drawing inference from sensitivity analyses of incomplete longitudinal clinical trial data via a re-analysis of data from a confirmatory clinical trial in depression. A likelihood-based approach that assumed missing at random (MAR) was the primary analysis. Robustness to departure from MAR was assessed by comparing the primary result to those from a series of analyses that employed varying missing not at random (MNAR) assumptions (selection models, pattern mixture models and shared parameter models) and to MAR methods that used inclusive models. The key sensitivity analysis used multiple imputation assuming that after dropout the trajectory of drug-treated patients was that of placebo treated patients with a similar outcome history (placebo multiple imputation). This result was used as the worst reasonable case to define the lower limit of plausible values for the treatment contrast. The endpoint contrast from the primary analysis was - 2.79 (p = .013). In placebo multiple imputation, the result was - 2.17. Results from the other sensitivity analyses ranged from - 2.21 to - 3.87 and were symmetrically distributed around the primary result. Hence, no clear evidence of bias from missing not at random data was found. In the worst reasonable case scenario, the treatment effect was 80% of the magnitude of the primary result. Therefore, it was concluded that a treatment effect existed. The structured sensitivity framework of using a worst reasonable case result based on a controlled imputation approach with transparent and debatable assumptions supplemented a series of plausible alternative models under varying assumptions was useful in this specific situation and holds promise as a generally useful framework.","inCitations":["814008d9298689cc9c4cb3c270d18b04e3043a1c","3ff3a515905f6ce9a80d5ee0fcf08c5a59315eb7","870b63b4b3e14ddbf9e9517de0383f19168e69e5","3a956c1988f54fd0b018c678d1134579f485d780","8b09927f32c5d2b1adb023ba5d00fc44c54e629f","d7d16ed4650efd3539a2e5adb54e4d33bd13c7a6","432efac0d6145b282f6be61d7c7fc208708e42c3","4bb9542c2f3028c2906a7c93be8a7e32f0220fb2","3cbed7c9bb90ec6c2d9512795962a8899e2737a1","f315838ab5d71c02e3a41d2cd9c81af529e46acc","13af64544678013e0d897d90be430776e5ef2e91","3539cc64572a4cc67a60f9d5159f83aff5cecfd9","f9ecfcf9b7c16591977058c73a7c4a54394049be","527d9ef1a3ce5e1b1f85498aa4018f93a71e641d"],"title":"A structured framework for assessing sensitivity to missing data assumptions in longitudinal clinical trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1547"}

The interval package depends on the perm package, also presented here, which performs exact and asymptotic linear permutation tests. The perm package performs many of the tests included in the already available coin package, and provides an independent validation of coin.

Many multistage dose-finding designs for this problem were originally developed for oncology studies where the mean dose-response is strictly increasing in dose. In non-oncology phase II dose-finding studies, the dose-response curve often plateaus in the range of interest, and there are several doses with the mean response equal to the target. In this case, it is usually of interest to find the lowest of these doses because higher doses might have higher adverse event rates. It is often desirable to compare the response rate at the estimated target dose with a placebo and/or active control. We investigate which of the several known dose-finding methods developed for oncology phase I trials is the most suitable when the dose-response curve plateaus. Some of the designs tend to spread the allocation among the doses on the plateau. Others, such as the continual reassessment method and the t-statistic design, concentrate allocation at one of the doses with the t-statistic design selecting the lowest dose on the plateau more frequently.","inCitations":["b44ca1d8c3ffb37ad65c2f80b2bbfa8c15876e46","5273f0cb7c002fd09f4cf00ac3511c738ccf99c8","f42b3a98cd00fd25caa5deda225c91c50e49f723"],"title":"Dose finding when the target dose is on a plateau of a dose-response curve: comparison of fully sequential designs.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1585"}

We present methods of estimating the baseline marginal distributions, covariate effects, and association parameters for clustered current status data based on second-order generalized estimating equations. We examine the efficiency gains realized from using second-order estimating equations compared with first-order equations, issues of copula misspecification, and apply the methods to motivating studies including one on the incidence of joint damage in patients with psoriatic arthritis.","inCitations":["10bdb67026584a1b4ea835f2da1839db3aee5b91","af15e662e601ccb5168b537425526700c7230453","9123bbc01f55e0000f2dc9bf7ec666b4c9cff8ed","06144cb9d8cce367f3523e5a33396f1a9d2d2dbc","c540a0c110f02a858d9b9f67e5b12503bf71daa1","33375db606f7c15922b651ec5f6059e020d87006"],"title":"Second-order estimating equations for the analysis of clustered current status data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp029"}

Any parametric time-to-event distribution may be fitted if the user supplies a probability density or hazard function, and ideally also their cumulative versions. Standard survival distributions are built in, including the three and four-parameter generalized gamma and F distributions. Any parameter of any distribution can be modeled as a linear or log-linear function of covariates. The package also includes the spline model of Royston and Parmar (2002), in which both baseline survival and covariate effects can be arbitrarily flexible parametric functions of time. The main model-fitting function, flexsurvreg, uses the familiar syntax of survreg from the standard survival package (Therneau 2016). Censoring or left-truncation are specified in 'Surv' objects. The models are fitted by maximizing the full log-likelihood, and estimates and confidence intervals for any function of the model parameters can be printed or plotted. flexsurv also provides functions for fitting and predicting from fully-parametric multi-state models, and connects with the mstate package (de Wreede, Fiocco, and Putter 2011).

These components are often based on several endpoints (primary and secondary endpoints) and several dose-control comparisons. When constructing a multiplicity adjustment in these settings, it is important to control the Type I error rate over all multiplicity components. An important class of multiple testing procedures, known as gatekeeping procedures, was derived using the mixture method that enables clinical trial sponsors to set up efficient multiplicity adjustments that account for clinically relevant logical relationships among the hypotheses of interest. An enhanced version of this mixture method is introduced in this paper to construct more powerful gatekeeping procedures for a specific type of logical relationships that rely on transitive serial restrictions. Restrictions of this kind are very common in Phase III clinical trials and the proposed method is applicable to a broad class of multiplicity problems. Several examples are provided to illustrate the new method and results of simulation trials are presented to compare the performance of gatekeeping procedures derived using this method and other available methods.","inCitations":["920f3ea3416cac09ff6b70d01bac940a293d2846"],"title":"An enhanced mixture method for constructing gatekeeping procedures in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2017.1399900"}
