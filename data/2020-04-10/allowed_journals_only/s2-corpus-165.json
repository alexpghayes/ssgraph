Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey we examine blood pressure trends in China from 1991 to 2009, with a concentration on age cohorts and urbanicity. Very large values of blood pressure are of interest, so we model the conditional quantile functions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This allows the covariate effects in the middle of the distribution to vary from those in the upper tail, the focal point of our analysis. We join the distributions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure using a copula, which permits the relationships between the covariates and the two responses to share information and enables probabilistic statements about systolic and diastolic blood pressure jointly. Our copula maintains the marginal distributions of the group quantile effects while accounting for within-subject dependence, enabling inference at the population and subject levels. Our population level regression effects change across quantile level, year, and blood pressure type, providing a rich environment for inference. To our knowledge, this is the first quantile function model to explicitly model within-subject autocorrelation and is the first quantile function approach that simultaneously models multivariate conditional response. We find that the association between high blood pressure and living in an urban area has evolved from positive to negative, with the strongest changes occurring in the upper tail. The increase in urbanization over the last twenty years coupled with the transition from the positive association between urbanization and blood pressure in earlier years to a more uniform association with urbanization suggests increasing blood pressure over time throughout China, even in less urbanized areas. Our methods are available in the R package BSquare.","inCitations":["946a7e50fd3198a53b38759ba2aeac1c22d421e5","f2e16bf06054bf0451b00c0a0bf9e831ec9d3301","0476a2b7a34fc99d18823399744de0f9378000d1","e1b448181feecef0e4120cc9351ab9d48ca34375","e2367f02b528899ef1aeebaf8e2e23b44fd75cab","6632b97d8374ff47d2ef3f22e4142013dc02e558","dbf06e6579a868decc7d2e90125c0400ab09df62","0739f44ab6c05004a2c7ec6b5f52825173054f99","7fe8d75473d34144b091c30e2b1a47c5ba44ad71"],"title":"Quantile Regression for Mixed Models with an Application to Examine Blood Pressure Trends in China.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS841"}

The common designs in this setting, for example, Simon 2-stage designs, are often developed based on testing whether a parameter of interest, usually a proportion (e.g. response rate), is less than a certain level or not. These designs usually consider only one parameter. However, sometimes we may encounter situations where we need to consider not a single parameter, but multiple parameters. This paper presents a two-stage design in which both primary and secondary endpoints are utilized in the decision rules. The family-wise Type 1 error rate and statistical power of the proposed design are investigated under a variety of situations by means of Monte-Carlo simulations.","inCitations":["95997883084298c92d9892768dc51480c98fed90","df1492f1510a7bfb407f55534f7012c0b72085eb","04e19d58c70fc638a8b5ac05e3d02d7618a798f6","5d0531bb30e138f2bfd05e204b69b5bcb9f6dd5d","d1c13608a41e6e9a5f2a84bdac0c4745ffcd7c0a","dc81a05dbc564b851f67c5ca281676f8520801d7","8ee5e4bd1c28897d8e7754095689aa827dd64418","706de60030ee5d38da2cf99b98269ed50721896f","b0e2d90e37fc4c35c873b20d8a1d5bedaac2e267","ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb","d067c30370fb2b53ff5a3a0adb829914f29408eb"],"title":"A two-stage phase II trial design utilizing both primary and secondary endpoints.","doi":"10.1002/pst.255"}

Riemannian HMC (RHMC) further improves the performance of HMC by exploiting the geometric properties of the parameter space. However, the geometric integrator used for RHMC involves implicit equations that require fixed-point iterations. In some cases, the computational overhead for solving implicit equations undermines RHMC's benefits. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, we propose an explicit integrator that replaces the momentum variable in RHMC by velocity. We show that the resulting transformation is equivalent to transforming Riemannian Hamiltonian dynamics to Lagrangian dynamics. Experimental results suggests that our method improves RHMC's overall computational e ciency in the cases considered.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2009,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In longitudinal data, interest is usually focused on the repeatedly measured variable itself. In some situations, however, the pattern of variation of the variable over time may contain information about a separate outcome variable. In such situations, longitudinal data provide an opportunity to develop predictive models for future observations of the separate outcome variable given the current data for an individual. In particular, longitudinally changing patterns of repeated measurements of a variable measured up to time t, or trajectories, can be used to predict an outcome measure or event that occurs after time t. In this article, we propose a method for predicting an outcome variable based on a generalized linear model, specifically, a logistic regression model, the covariates of which are variables that characterize the trajectory of an individual. Since the trajectory of an individual contains estimation error, the proposed logistic regression model constitutes a measurement error model. The model is fitted in two steps. First, a linear mixed model is fitted to the longitudinal data to estimate the random effect that characterizes the trajectory for each individual while adjusting for other covariates. In the second step, a conditional likelihood approach is applied to account for the estimation error in the trajectory. Prediction of an outcome variable is based on the logistic regression model in the second step. The receiver operating characteristic curve is used to compare the discrimination ability of a model with trajectories to one without trajectories as covariates. A simulation study is used to assess the performance of the proposed method, and the method is applied to clinical trial data.","inCitations":["defa738b07618dc65200a426a37f13acb6820225","b4a5690e6fbfbdd9aac2f2f58af995c98aa77370","45631763a26361007cd3301273670ee5880ad84a","10adc3e01dece53658db83226410a9ec7fe047fe"],"title":"Prediction of an outcome using trajectories estimated from a linear mixed model.","doi":"10.1080/10543400903105174"}

Moser, Stevens, and Watts described the noncentral density and a numerical integration algorithm for computing power. We present simple and accurate approximations for the power of the Satterthwaite test statistic. Two advantages accrue. First, the approximations substantially reduce the computational burden for tasks such as plotting power curves. Second, the approximations substantially simplify the programming and thereby make power calculations more widely available. Four methods of power approximation are evaluated for test sizes of .001, .01, .05, and .10, sample sizes of 6 and 51, variance ratios of 1 and 10, and noncentrality parameters from 0 to 50 by 1. A method based on a ratio of expected values is recommended due to its accuracy and simplicity.","inCitations":["b1bc676395e037f8f635af63f50d9fa71c93b38e","629758de27161160c5ce051a6736c8b2004b42bc","f7efdb40a44ae2c9f04f2314e2c29dcb1705e419","0935abb3bcd51c7496b9c9ed49297ba8ec0ec125","79156be7644617499809d24eaff050ae01f6d60f","7e7a9c03da71ee572d485b2f427894bd8cb48360","8aeb3c8c4bf87bae569f765d494106b629c94909","84a88384115476b4e4bd7a0ad5137c815fc4f4d5","8716ee1f2854db13b6cfe23ca22c749c9dc41e17","060d6b7d05208ba1f21b76e84a6b8306bd857e88","bcbcece381df8ccf064f3bd99a4a319bd941a5d8","7d837bd3831a97130377735f16ba26045c306427"],"title":"A Comparison of Power Approximations for Satterthwaite's Test.","doi":"10.1080/03610919508813260"}

Though recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in instrument performance and the computational tools used, significant challenges remain, and there are many opportunities for statisticians to make important contributions. In the most widely used \"bottom-up\" approach to proteomics, complex mixtures of proteins are first subjected to enzymatic cleavage, the resulting peptide products are separated based on chemical or physical properties and analyzed using a mass spectrometer. The two fundamental challenges in the analysis of bottom-up MS-based proteomics are: (1) Identifying the proteins that are present in a sample, and (2) Quantifying the abundance levels of the identified proteins. Both of these challenges require knowledge of the biological and technological context that gives rise to observed data, as well as the application of sound statistical principles for estimation and inference. We present an overview of bottom-up proteomics and outline the key statistical issues that arise in protein identification and quantification.","inCitations":["d95e3271f5e3eab54c3ff0566ae130edcf76cfc2","1b28de41bbf8602225d1bab21d9594d96ad3781a","98df85e6c2a4bc22b76b814445d2ce3aecffa357","256a1b14393e61bae33727a8566a38c9916538b5","094398bcba2c0e4163fd5f6d6c5a331e45e228e7","057fba562df0ba91d7e0d256aac84d4a35cc223c","55101dd6fe7cdfc5483368f32ae48c80ed9d9b33","ee6aac52ee81c923208275534fa541183f8e7753","c4c86c2d948cc90a665c63db7ceca36176e2616f","29973a351116f6b604834c3f8421a5f15bfb175e","6016982ac58ddc5ff14619f1eeb7e43013fe2307","8a34045b794fba69020c7873ce9aede104fcb401","8044e42bc9c154f476614c1b9d602f483cbcddc9","04104139bd9ed6b154938c8062599db85705a0d5","c3864aa83e6894c672cd824ce7b7d038ef603964","4985eb84f252b24d2cf17baeb0a5b9e96096367e","6553f2b79bb2663cdb389f10aaf23e09e18eec72","d3d3d00401a38639ca64839021ea325a572f359e","7c76c6e8e83277b102200fefaf326eeb50a4186c","6e19e6bb94f785916752be61aa169dc11f6aa05c","65777d4df6ab0a8f84bca5bb40c4fdceb09cfc34","87cb2aa05fa356e1c1354c9ce38d50dc37d1a294","4e13257225a24798fcc4035bd251186efe3a6775","47ef1344b75bea20178eb9d91a35a37fd11d95c7","0f2586e271147d63cf85bb8fa94dcc62bc3cc378","a641fa65637c61433866052c20049778ecf41f5e","24ef20d88ca0def0a99a35c5a614e4eca120c4aa","785ecce2e215f427890a58bc9b3894c94005bb21","9e44409c35ad546a1e4a40834ec6c12a5f683504","a70504489705cd916961134b806c7029ac7a271b","fa00dc96baf2cd9df47731a457391d711643c63b","0fd896703b26506f20b83b0d644c35d3a5d2460a","d561ef5a1ccb5fb5c698b0d6fd0f39b01a09be88","932b062e6c82479bcc665e54bf22cf023a365fd5"],"title":"Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics: Biological and Technological Aspects.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS341"}

In this paper, we extend the prior work to optimize adaptive sequential designs over a range of geometric mean test/reference ratios (GMRs) of 70-143% within each of two ranges of intra-subject coefficient of variation (10-30% and 30-55%). These designs also introduce a futility decision for stopping the study after the first stage if there is sufficiently low likelihood of meeting bioequivalence criteria if the second stage were completed, as well as an upper limit on total study size. The optimized designs exhibited substantially improved performance characteristics over our previous adaptive sequential designs. Even though the optimized designs avoided undue inflation of type I error and maintained power at ≥ 80%, their average sample sizes were similar to or less than those of conventional single stage designs.","inCitations":["93aa285297d412cd877a24a53366bd94462fd1c8","62943c91aa008c4b9338195c767b467fe6a3314f","c72a87cf47beb86fcb9c28b1df8a52bd581455d2","2f60dc3064136e0d59b37ee541240b1cd8cd4d8a","3485c87ea4c014b50e93759f1e9f021421a083d6","06a80e5d355a901e24f88704765f74d630d23114","77fbca12dbeda21c66744112d85f9454f362f0ed","9d84fdaae6c7ca304d361bd831879e405fbdd680"],"title":"Optimal adaptive sequential designs for crossover bioequivalence studies.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1721"}

A particular example of this, remission in psoriatic arthritis, is considered in detail for illustration. A 3-state model is proposed for characterizing the transition rates into and out of remission. Remission is linked to an initial and subsequent state for the purpose of introducing the condition that remission must be of some duration to be clinically meaningful.

Removal of noise from DTI is an important problem due to the high scientific relevance of DTI and relatively low signal to noise ratio it provides. Leading approaches to this problem amount to estimation of weighted Karcher means of Diffusion tensors within spatial neighborhoods, under various metrics imposed on the space of tensors. However, it is unclear how the behavior of these estimators varies with the magnitude of DTI sensor noise (the noise resulting from the thermal e!ects of MRI scanning) as well as the geometric structure of the underlying Diffusion tensor neighborhoods. In this paper, we combine theoretical analysis, empirical analysis of simulated DTI data, and empirical analysis of real DTI scans to compare the noise removal performance of three kernel-based DTI smoothers that are based on Euclidean, log-Euclidean, and affine-invariant metrics. The results suggest, contrary to conventional wisdom, that imposing a simplistic Euclidean metric may in fact provide comparable or superior noise removal, especially in relatively unstructured regions and/or in the presence of moderate to high levels of sensor noise. On the contrary, log-Euclidean and affine-invariant metrics may lead to better noise removal in highly structured anatomical regions, especially when the sensor noise is of low magnitude. These findings emphasize the importance of considering the interplay of sensor noise magnitude and tensor field geometric structure when assessing Diffusion tensor smoothing options. They also point to the necessity for continued development of smoothing methods that perform well across a large range of scenarios.","inCitations":["0efcb67bd24da1a5720b699bbfe038d3bc08a289","0f6c4cff6a7dfa0b70ae4b5c921cd7e9ed420bfd","13a30f1a99fc1ab055be834c82239e7304df2add","73912abcfed5d686db9f86cb2824bc477d36cd66","9a512badc617512fb65ecdf97aec7d2655c96f81","2e50859fef5dd412cf75ee948e64fb5c25414364","28d36d5be49a3a1f48b686e1d7039bfcca749112","5bb5218c3627e98481011b77e0bc147e15a01c45","2baa53b05ed75a2b20f0f474b9e821877b6101ce","e98351446a85681062280d229de5ce62c5bbeaa7","8853c1c9ab659c057b86a063414d9a823f67539c","f92b839b97f02ec025a2913ba515f89b390d4fe9","d5174d36d3f2f29eaf100e87a039fcbacfea444d"],"title":"Diffusion tensor smoothing through weighted Karcher means.","doi":"10.1214/13-EJS825"}

Compensation by benefits other than efficacy is usually the justification for using a new treatment, as long as the loss of efficacy is within an acceptable margin (NI margin) from the standard treatment. A popular approach is to express this margin in terms of the efficacy difference between the new treatment and the active control. Based on this approach and the realization that NI trials often comprise several new treatments, statistical procedures that simultaneously conduct NI tests of several new treatments have been developed. However, these procedures rely on the assumption that the variances of the treatments are homogeneous. In this article, we discuss the undesirable effect of using these procedures on the familywise Type I error rate when the treatment responses have heterogeneous variances. To alleviate this problem, we reveal potential procedures that are more appropriate. Further, a power study is conducted to compare the different procedures to provide guidance on the selection of adequate testing procedures in NI trials. Clinical examples are given for illustrative purposes.","inCitations":["488bf7d6c9f6619f2a58c2cc372a22c2e9958e4a","da5ddc2b35a3949ce264347c21b099438d8dac47"],"title":"Noninferiority Studies with Multiple New Treatments and Heterogeneous Variances.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.920346"}

In practice, the observations are often curves instead of the traditional points. In this article, the agreement problem is studied for curved data. Following the rationale in constructing a correlation coefficient curve for heterocorrelaticity, an agreement curve is proposed to measure agreement as a function of the independent variable for curved data. The agreement curve overcomes the drawback when only one index is used in assessing the agreement of two measurements, and it covers all situations including the nonconstant mean, nonhomogenous variance, and the data range. A real dataset is used to demonstrate the approach and to show accurate assessment and information gained if curved data are used.","inCitations":["313dd66aad0d3b6bd433729d84eab03ea031ea50"],"title":"Agreement for curved data.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200048810"}

When the response variables are continuous, parametric or nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance techniques can be applied to analyze the data. However, multivariate methods for dichotomous response variables are less developed in the statistical literature. An example of the need for such a method is a decompression sickness (DCS) study in which each animal subject is examined for the presence of multiple types of DCS. Two risk factors related to the outcomes are studied. Finding the range of these 2 risk factors for a fixed probability to develop DCS translates to the statistical question of estimating a 2D toxic dose corresponding to a fixed risk for multiple dichotomous outcomes. We propose a Gumbel-type generalization of logistic regression and use maximum likelihood estimation method to fit the model. The estimation of 2D toxic dose can then be based on the fitted model. We illustrate our methods with the Wisconsin sheep data.","inCitations":["8985307bc8367cc9759f244e25ed010ee84c2a61","1a28470d3ddcecc1d695d25c56e323b86d716d33","2fb016da7cb6c97735008cd2d87a20425ed1f2b5","a425cdd05a9664dcb59e8e364470e70b23971d52","c783a13c3292fdece45ce07836eada0d157fc572","cd7058c51e48fa62f04c419ec289e53ef5bedd4f","1bf919fd743fdce5eccf7595a62e3e547a3d25b0","248ce9b9adcd2807cd97f027fdf9fb4f726a9aad","e2a4a7a50fdab13817785e07d17299fe3fe373ec"],"title":"Two-dimensional toxic dose and multivariate logistic regression, with application to decompression sickness.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq044"}

Although the primary interest is to demonstrate that an invention delays death, the expected death rate is often that low that studies focussing on survival exclusively are not feasible. Components of the composite endpoint are chosen such that their occurrence is predictive for time to death. Therefore, if the time to non-fatal events is censored by death, censoring is no longer independent. As a consequence, the analysis of the components of a composite endpoint cannot be reasonably performed using classical methods for the analysis of survival times like Kaplan-Meier estimates or log-rank tests. In this paper we visualize the impact of disregarding dependent censoring during the analysis and discuss practicable alternatives for the analysis of morbidity/mortality studies. In the context of simulations we provide evidence that copula-based methods have the potential to deliver practically unbiased estimates of hazards of components of a composite endpoint. At the same time, they require minimal assumptions, which is important since not all assumptions are generally verifiable because of censoring. Therefore, there are alternative ways to analyze morbidity/mortality studies more appropriately by accounting for the dependencies among the components of composite endpoints. Despite the limitations mentioned, these alternatives can at minimum serve as sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of the currently used methods.","inCitations":["a3b526387591e7a1504ed48ff5c158401f434e6b","333119b0d785ed40673909b5917f8a514f92b1d7","5ad745051464cb74dca903db257bc150ba95c099"],"title":"Another view on the analysis of cardiovascular morbidity/mortality trials.","doi":"10.1002/pst.434"}

Given the usual assumptions, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was shown to provide adequate baseline correction with consequent unbiased tests for the treatments x blocks interaction, as well as the main effect for the randomized treatments. Tests relying on simple pre-post difference scores and percentage change scores evidenced seriously conservative or nonconservative bias in the test for treatments x blocks interaction effect, a bias that depended on the direction of the corresponding interaction effect observed in the baseline measurements alone.

Typically, these measurements are reported and displayed linearly on chromosome maps, and gains and losses are detected as deviations from normal diploid cells. We propose that one may consider denoising the data to uncover the true copy number changes before drawing inferences on the patterns of aberrations in the samples. Nonparametric techniques are particularly suitable for data denoising as they do not impose a parametric model in finding structures in the data. In this paper, we employ wavelets to denoise the data as wavelets have sound theoretical properties and a fast computational algorithm, and are particularly well suited for handling the abrupt changes seen in array-CGH data. A simulation study shows that denoising data prior to testing can achieve greater power in detecting the aberrant spot than using the raw data without denoising. Finally, we illustrate the method on two array-CGH data sets.","inCitations":["92471ef86de66e5c797628554ca52e87920c02c6","34f7618e8d5a7e4670eb12f9a3a342fca8d4a62f","50b2ad6be0f56fb052e85b514fb51de7672c4ef9","490ab51af7524a1142ba3a0125748618646ae719","83322c36bee6afe0996bc33e960ca7af31f9609a","73a63f5ef2788cf1aacfd804f0b757c900a899ca","3a35da1d44d10f3ce22e0842a8c630395cbc0765","4b4a4146834393c5c9acd63c7a4f1bb34e705983","85f5cdb59876169538aebe8a31fcef9adad245a6","828e0735b989ccc267c5783ef9c27910920ad339","837d9b66a4392fbc656ff4716b88e68e9b2739f5","1e2979181146e5591eb40a3ab88ffda27bcae1c0","4bb53fb450d72be7ec4f9424f1a212a84ae8d587","a8516a5c83ddfe930249a9407657485560e1ef79","3fb89470bb9a71aa57d775956b49f0d24c3c27a6","59488f3744cc09b4b6d8adf13aa4db8220ec31f1","183db19ba97dbdffc642ea3d571b761193a3ebde","b04d10c0d5d4b2ce256d0ab7678e30cfe949f3d9","d7f104e26f656a31366dec6ca1271a92c1c8ba79","7f0d11f139066d3fd782e076348f620f6ecd128d","2753294683bf5dcd3b85c2df283fd276a7416433","05f902c448c91ed5d3eba1e144a3d536df828990","2163c538b18e3fee559fcd782a04ba8942cb178d","0f85a76735c125ecffd0087e84b32e49c51481ea","944cda1cdc0e9d8f2a8f41eede84069f8d5c64fc","24fbf2c27d5f9a1cfeed41787c4e939b724086b6","cb5b12782b3283dd1ae9af6461f20a47e489e77b","a133e8c5d15b7d63dc343f0fa64882e5df59935e","bb2212bf92b92e15813851b5fd8cd3f348a16eba","6a3752f4ef19f92bc8d0dfcc66f2844c2fae5f50","890be87e4272f0cdd426406a08f5ebad02423589","03fc43d90846a7081a254267f55e78c7cc4fe6b3","ecdd7ad0bfc9edc404f6b5005cf470373397fd1d","d45206169004af1f3878bd88d9c079b283f8ab92","8694b4e590dc63775d2fca94331291e62b87873c","1720998874dbcebfbe72856945633c097e69387f","5b0946f1ffeaca1862f7f598d1d4045b7984a25e","0260a1100802f9173b24a3040c02032f42d94381","cc5c3aba01838a0e5361242fedc234920b62edac","b665d3810afa6e0c1c1bff52daf735ea9188b076","6888a18ba57bd60b196b07c7560ac83c2edd4c71","09cf6a002e04139783fd7f20089adf0788789dfd","c3e09cc358043a8fa62513748840142dcbcfaf02","e08b49153828f8d9ed5c2b8a58c9e035a2c14035","fdbd00990753f74f958ca244846eff9159b8a87a","438dc46c48574e8526c27b18e128e947607e06f0","32ec06c8cd5cea328af79660c188c56c0b01b5b3","a10abf098a2fbacf90aef0fb35bf5a07d933a692","912c38e5095424a0d0ee9ba57f6f0ff3262e14c3","35a6f05d497ba59c2eeb517072ce84a88f1ae154","88e3f256b3f62323e97985b46d1231310c61a49b","980b16c4f3c3b4db28f093ccefbdd19b27e91411","be91adaac10f662625ed13eda6a3d01bf1e50f00","690b27bdee882da47cedfd4fe5f5dadf94ac7137","c6bf6993c11b7de7ded7092d3c6007fdbc7e319b","f69844cea04ca8c3d732d828e81f873f3612a823","8484fdc21c3a3e8b294ec7ad495432c9618231df","7a3fdcfe39f5a5ce357e7ea63a3c41de76830cf1","030c6ed7d39a66585cb4fb8d8884e800ecdae916","89a5bb83edf5dc5e23d80e5a2a9ac5a0781095d9","b6558cfc5e3668f0d004cb262bdd06c6c26a006d","261332c33599648448837574b31da9d4259a2cdc","903bf6d9b028c560a2da701f7540c1daa5c8d3bf","44cbf48fa5c6bbe4fc3b1253b388d9c584b59c12","6b1b3d19f78e74c3bd28526db77c3611e6b8a101","8af73dc0ae222c532f496b12ca1746cef6d2ce93","4db3c35b8ff8d9b3a7890d8a0f3d467974217413","a0781ff3336c4a41ccba40111258444b8ebd6961","836bf146232fb6e27215c60f17b04aa5831dddec","c5632b354f53e369753be7e10efce55eccda0383","03eec63d9edf842f921cc32e261d1e6ba155f1a4","2e20dda16a9595e92508af341d710d9c3cad1d68","ce7f61db0baf10371bee8f2ab06da5262a1ef0f8","48314ef6a3d79194d26d660d2152d89c1cdb6a13","8efaa78ec8744e4d267e762ff5172ad83bc4e73b","aff0dd55d190037dcdbdaa5a1dda28c2f2f4733a","9024827bf035ce19ef8dc7741e76de8eda33e83d","81652b3ae4d7bf7ae19489584485cb5c0a2958bc","fe1443744c71cf73889295e7a5a9ce32018e5d68","8f4142a8358e554fe3a8279acf75556d737ba8a5","3b1e8dc1160ee513a4541b73897e8c06c79b6b4c","688a42ec18dd1aec6432281f2f8fe626abca91b0","03bbf44bc42c24492fdd24e104d53a4cd4d8ad8b","c782a8fbda216e2f6846028e1aeb07493c10cd91","3ce13c46f5cff3096bd9c23395e96992e20d1ff3","1a668f83b985c8045b165fac3dd4c64ec7ad6a45","fe38ae4b442f777297971816d4dc1b8829986fb3","07f7cab12a16bb2c4ad8f5c8eab7ea383b5321c6","5af72ced591b1adc7e8e7fa223206e1e089caa35","cc90a4dc6af6b95e65b0f04431617437260e47ac","d62d133632789139848179dcbfdff82e02c365c6","5ab84c0d4d19499d3db18b4ebb671850322467c8","3cf5558b5ac999ba68479a9226bba779ffcbd79d","9a69c28ea82afae1496a68aea108e9c76051aeb7","d10152879f3a8c7fd653df7547f1e5597584aaf5","ffe9ea6868bf3e64f434fbca99ddc7fc74b9b02a","8caf7e44118d14f399b5bf5a62f8b50eaba4f34f","accda795ac140b7c95336e873ed1310bfda55aa0","f0fd49c9913cbb48c44fa12e67269e484fce86e6","a7d82c13fc2192a8e7b8c80c48782bf1cadc0715","e07ed40a196539c61b213e7a1cf2942ad4a6b151","814b710d6b25a59a8684419c7bba02706582eef2","72e0d37b3c9c694a5c0e620a07e0a05e60777f55","8e3ff3cf312bf556e913818c58ba4a21767655f7","bf34980bbe0951273f917877d83fcbf32d33906e","51c9b95b5916ee9ffc5b0f96af7a1fc893cad578","d5be94b98276863b7116b364429776cc6266d3cf","d069e7ad957dc6a5c7854b322f7e42dc644d370c","3d1e7d593dbd7b2945d0402cce0b3b1c6a2c50ba","44ccce9c3c7b72eee693103f425ed174e213696f","8ef9c999b5e03f3696d2067aa4f43dfccd7168dd","651a49439d792fd66e600f60e4a0d922e0f976a9","04e0cec9aa01a36e4b360849b7993858b7094397","72e7a8c74b3c71bb4cfb63a9e92c3113a13155bb","fdea5bf5f09946b621b3585241e0d7e84b71e476","20f7069867063ef48f2ae3c35e24f4d4

It is shown that the smoothed bootstrap offers a motivation for choosing the proposed MISE estimates for minimization.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2015,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Clinical studies in overactive bladder have traditionally used analysis of covariance or nonparametric methods to analyse the number of incontinence episodes and other count data. It is known that if the underlying distributional assumptions of a particular parametric method do not hold, an alternative parametric method may be more efficient than a nonparametric one, which makes no assumptions regarding the underlying distribution of the data. Therefore, there are advantages in using methods based on the Poisson distribution or extensions of that method, which incorporate specific features that provide a modelling framework for count data. One challenge with count data is overdispersion, but methods are available that can account for this through the introduction of random effect terms in the modelling, and it is this modelling framework that leads to the negative binomial distribution. These models can also provide clinicians with a clearer and more appropriate interpretation of treatment effects in terms of rate ratios. In this paper, the previously used parametric and non-parametric approaches are contrasted with those based on Poisson regression and various extensions in trials evaluating solifenacin and mirabegron in patients with overactive bladder. In these applications, negative binomial models are seen to fit the data well.","inCitations":["3b744a5289d756204c150a21e40d67b7bb3ef78e","1561f7274d49afe26580f5bdfdf1db94746c23ba","6c87c321d00a0f3723343a29448d5d93d3eb0c5b","351396a9967b08477e74d8355556c595bb5ae546","d4eb9cc5da51c7302a5a1a9e451c309d4256684d"],"title":"The analysis of incontinence episodes and other count data in patients with overactive bladder by Poisson and negative binomial regression.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1664"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2006,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"This paper describes the distinction between the concept of statistical power and the probability of getting a successful trial. While one can choose a very high statistical power to detect a certain treatment effect, the high statistical power does not necessarily translate to a high success probability if the treatment effect to detect is based on the perceived ability of the drug candidate. The crucial factor hinges on our knowledge of the drug's ability to deliver the effect used to power the study. The paper discusses a framework to calculate the 'average success probability' and demonstrates how uncertainty about the treatment effect could affect the average success probability for a confirmatory trial. It complements an earlier work by O'Hagan et al. (Pharmaceutical Statistics 2005; 4:187-201) published in this journal. Computer codes to calculate the average success probability are included.","inCitations":["1ccb0574255929a8c03e4f1512df071d049f07a0","f98466c9eb3de6810f68698af8f3fa4e722c46ee","351a51d7a64cea3b6e16db0c8fd863695784066d","ff007081a16160e4e2b0c784318384b5a87a5389","75bdfc843186ea55717c4c8a39f85f60dec27d73","97f4bd9b4fe145f9556cc8696d7885c0974fd1a4","5a7877a7a6744ebc9aa33d3edad004ea332e7a27","4a47be4d4a315cea5d27353fc26836f63a527660","3d4183a2afaa11365803e195d0d13f6f2e91a450","21da563c92807c3fecd830e2fb83ddccec483c2f","3ded3d6827bfb88f33a7154016e43bd9cb21d814","47cf5c0af4565f10f3ada3f9e47c4b85e1dc2a33","060634e6665969215f954573a049c4def4fa7b68","ffd7a1cee6b90a6970cbf6b983331c03264bbba8","67dd7d5371d87f44fe6d34dbd3f4ebd2f7567cb6","05005972c30e6da0a8dc848d6b47026c7c756e36","35dbf1d45c219871dbdd4da1f93490dc72cce4da","5b3970158f3869bf2ec247897d8984b528c859ca","ca79b4b5fe709c6705f6eb75d555c4f226a82563","bdbea780c0ad935e0bd586ce73acad85fbaedf6b","f82273c8d234dcc9ff0e8b50beda879558ef199b","e7ffbcf891eed7e4cef0ff07bbf6664af6c610d9","e1fd5031b15ca0f94914d860077e3a92a9263997","6ea392364945fbd1bd006b14738f7bd35dc1c38f","b88e06c700338d7b87011665d2df1383cc5c9355","d7c38e9d7864adb503899c7198ea8927a01d7515","41d008fc81655230c7c9b8fc92c21e8fe61fc7ed","8105d1a75b2cc75cac33eac6f7327539714e88ba","6ae9cd0dc35480f12996d8fb572efea51dc6a41e","2118abe5e9a9dcfa2b4bdfa6cea4bef159ae8879","003fbde6a92c21ca4c3428e6527cd0f7954e91f1"],"title":"Sample size and the probability of a successful trial.","doi":"10.1002/pst.232"}
