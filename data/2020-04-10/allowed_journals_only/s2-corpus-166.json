The effect of more realistic social network structure on estimates of epidemic parameters is an open area of exploration. We develop a detailed statistical model to estimate the social contact network within a high school using friendship network data and a survey of contact behavior. Our contact network model includes classroom structure, longer durations of contacts to friends than non-friends and more frequent contacts with friends, based on reports in the contact survey. We performed simulation studies to explore which network structures are relevant to influenza transmission. These studies yield two key findings. First, we found that the friendship network structure important to the transmission process can be adequately represented by a dyad-independent exponential random graph model (ERGM). This means that individual-level sampled data is sufficient to characterize the entire friendship network. Second, we found that contact behavior was adequately represented by a static rather than dynamic contact network. We then compare a targeted antiviral prophylaxis intervention strategy and a grade closure intervention strategy under random mixing and network-based mixing. We find that random mixing overestimates the effect of targeted antiviral prophylaxis on the probability of an epidemic when the probability of transmission in 10 minutes of contact is less than 0.004 and underestimates it when this transmission probability is greater than 0.004. We found the same pattern for the final size of an epidemic, with a threshold transmission probability of 0.005. We also find random mixing overestimates the effect of a grade closure intervention on the probability of an epidemic and final size for all transmission probabilities. Our findings have implications for policy recommendations based on models assuming random mixing, and can inform further development of network-based models.","inCitations":["1ef88855ec57d5601baee0ce9debd6ebec0928bd","c2729b6509994785a58bced8e1a8f391a1cdee27","7643c0eb730f239e517dcf03a52224196871f0c6","1f0ec975b22d7664aa3165e0a83140f292f05e41","76be16cbef6172dd253078c1d8b4dc40a1181612","49d0cfe06ca258b9e9156a0464aef8528cfb41fd","c4158c69815dac5fe45dbc913410c5ded05f1f53","043a51050ddc14e65dd02a8a0bdb154e5cef3b41","23575286f12246b229296f0b4a57ea8f0f85f881","e926c0bed307cf3ac38c44a9f0e8fddb26cf5269","fcdeabe7bca57eba4ad1b1321005d4678f1667b2","74035b9b3dcf9021c16a86382b2484fdee65bc19","3b4a7275729f051b2c0ec439f2d44f59e7726699","a4f3dfeb7e52ce88ebe33378eb7e9064510cdb94","4224cd713573eb29a178a9fe530659d35bd3d029","81fc46b1f7f8a02795aaf31652724b6d2df3f7c1","fece96dd590c5732d33e536bbd190f596737244b","6fb431666e474e41e7da42ec60bb2ba0f478448f","2eeff1db66113f6f2a0bfd4faca6d41b714798da","9a7ede4cac07841179e3bfe27e4dcd70e6679bf4","8ce3301abac8e4b2a14765e1f9a05294dafc3ee4","5be3288f7c894a7897f3c7c361ff77a1511d7038","7d09e20a059f0235b0dd39cd509b2c39593835d9","75f3e39ded6d0bac5993dfc0b672621b1ecf7ec7","dbbbf23b369af6b3516b96d91f83856b1f142c87","59ee62ac156cfb3f5a6d0804d675cbb810830e52","6d1a9147ecd91d9ae86994bd75a782978c6f5a9b","d149b49d19fcc9d85c813bd3ac728a4ad4d53a82","4beae557ac79263091a530ce5e1d3bb344872643","e3db05ad9c3e00ae7989c9fd187223d8319fd525","2839e813d2d62cb0d5f87f2bc403010ed6db07c0","e1e24c28a116cc3b076341bdee535578816e744c","981e9e108c5f6316e84c8bf38101c6222e82103e","5d15f77afad7b529c60989bb0cf780b11410000d","3b0c0da42a8c107b618d03f0c0ba088864f1c22a","b670529e4681a199ce17f5aa505fcc49e9acb12a","fd31c2b535869bd4efc6d87c384ae0b79ece2451"],"title":"Estimating Within-School Contact Networks to Understand Influenza Transmission","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS505"}

We employ a particular marginal structural model (MSM), proposed by Robins (2000), and follow a general methodology for constructing estimating functions in censored data models. The inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) estimator of Robins et al. (2000) is used as an initial estimator and forms the basis for an improved, one-step estimator that is consistent and asymptotically linear when the treatment mechanism is consistently estimated. We extend these methods to handle informative censoring. The proposed methodology is employed to estimate the causal effect of exercise on mortality in a longitudinal study of seniors in Sonoma County. A simulation study demonstrates the bias of naive estimators in the presence of time-dependent confounders and also shows the efficiency gain of the IPTW estimator, even in the absence such confounding. The efficiency gain of the improved, one-step estimator is demonstrated through simulation.","inCitations":["104de8308bad5780cb1346690462900aa69fa1ef","593b5721b9cfb272805e330ebb8dd03b41ed073e","0a0f6134fcc4cc73518db0e3adb43ea87445ad19","4b10d37fddbbab46ea21a64856e42747653cc5de","0832e3738ee7c3f8cbb33ade118114655780aa3c","35b5239580e6381f06945381101767250d6ec85b","3804dc718e4b7b66126c6db7ca68cb9e73eb52da","46819934102fe920edde2d13a58250bb43534ad0","dd1fc7669c1d98bdf79343ebd997b1dbdcceb387","47d05f12f4243f0eabfad6fe66add96810cbdb43","9151d84629277bab26148bdb6379626b44e1cd0a","c7e6362de5bcc7f85f542fefed7499ef2bbdfb9e","3426592c30dc50a893da1ce92a19b68ee6045cad","646396749b27926e605a25241e78a189f1d693c2","7136ff99fb115b986bd5a8ee20c831600ee2e157","d5ffdec767fd7f461570ba961557bf4576544071","0a478f518a22173b8c1a7ec0ae53ba3649ae2ea2","2f022e372e7b03245743277b38d5ff4a53419486","a2b3e211ecb0353f3a011154d47d7e60eaaef433","c9407c07efcb0e6073cff47aa50945b1a197033a","fb721f1a69544c15426c266afcf3c84eed269d9a","334a48aa65935cac57a79716ae264fb2c244af11","945925f65b182f2572c7d0203303b386c787c8ca","53838a0fdf7326e09d9f24d5971e244433d74c5b","10034476ab37df6511759053d6e45b2d411d133a","fc41ac21596f8d2da1214f9c0fca9f4942639340","3012e16fbc0729db4aa8a7271946d6e98b7f6df6"],"title":"Analysis of longitudinal marginal structural models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxg041"}

Both Type I error rate and power were investigated. Different model sizes, sample sizes, numbers of categories, and threshold distributions were considered. Statistics associated with both the diagonally weighted least squares (cat-DWLS) estimator and with the unweighted least squares (cat-ULS) estimator were studied. Recent research suggests that cat-ULS parameter estimates and robust standard errors slightly outperform cat-DWLS estimates and robust standard errors (Forero, Maydeu-Olivares, & Gallardo-Pujol, 2009). The findings of the present research suggest that the mean- and variance-adjusted test statistic associated with the cat-ULS estimator performs best overall. A new version of this statistic now exists that does not require a degrees-of-freedom adjustment (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2010), and this statistic is recommended. Overall, the cat-ULS estimator is recommended over cat-DWLS, particularly in small to medium sample sizes.","inCitations":["b97d2266ba0c9491ae85c1bdd7afb568046f13ff","9bf0aff33ce97f4e88d3676b7b1e2bf5c03aa380","56f155f4e57264ab741939f85df1a1bdb937883a","20ac1a328e9a445d8f5a0615ede49398b59a1f7b","227c65ec8dc043a62b3315ad0fd79b4600254698","614a5de73218c117ea07c91365a4978aa36d88c1","184edb1eabd1e9242c3f9034c8d62995131240d5","62b14aaf8286a602b24b5d1bc86c690f48b13f51","825e431f4719400f48b522277578764969ade969","e730f324f9d1ec342c5609431ce1a14a90916877","3d12860e38a1435f423f5f5cba00de31a0cf166e","ab4b23bbf62bbf0446fc46c948434f31b1260301","43dcef1afe8972c78feb57f98747aab1f99287f4","608ae859228c7980f6cb286a11d09877bd0616c2","e4b49d76010b724de9f20b8cfc4e4d9f09df1e96","aa02a70b9b7638a2170f02380df29beb2d2259e0","12ee68ec5dff9f347c7078cff424f91850040fdd","bd306c305ebcbe250dd06e662be6cc42bc6ed076","06d75e4ed3bf49db9a19f41d3c8e2bf0ef9c0b00","b957673f97fe98c3850939a627555579220e23ad","61c5989863cb4635b7a08350a91436c4975bc59e"],"title":"The performance of robust test statistics with categorical data.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02049.x"}

The R package GLASSO [5] is popular, fast, and allows one to efficiently build a path of models for different values of the tuning parameter. Convergence of GLASSO can be tricky; the converged precision matrix might not be the inverse of the estimated covariance, and occasionally it fails to converge with warm starts. In this paper we explain this behavior, and propose new algorithms that appear to outperform GLASSO. By studying the \"normal equations\" we see that, GLASSO is solving the dual of the graphical lasso penalized likelihood, by block coordinate ascent; a result which can also be found in [2]. In this dual, the target of estimation is Σ, the covariance matrix, rather than the precision matrix Θ. We propose similar primal algorithms P-GLASSO and DP-GLASSO, that also operate by block-coordinate descent, where Θ is the optimization target. We study all of these algorithms, and in particular different approaches to solving their coordinate sub-problems. We conclude that DP-GLASSO is superior from several points of view.","inCitations":["6f71f84b981c20e696f5b18d3bb529017e80188d","9b4e30395e0ba2fcecbd9d10f588fea9fbabcc57","d724c3b5d74a3f7c477464111841fcf4e6cbcd3a","fffcdd2541018f8dfe806d7db653e36c88d8fcd9","13eca83b1e43da2a66c5a9fed1f5a49e3b2b6f4a","d67980d9ac31b0f6e4c3b0e4bc33f653a881bdf0","0a960c17acc7ca5aac8ab7ca14cc0c3f51ebd363","107a051d28fb2b1026bdcd90d1a98add28d90b73","b37b9191170e1695ddb0d1822f6ba2bc914aae77","643ce4aa9d6c82b9985c132ca4c575d45476e6c6","1da82004afd9045af3c1cae866064982ec21a956","032de8fdf72e0b1662b91dee2807dc021e1833d1","84c2693004d4863d003b6a6de9679420c2022fe6","e211e5539899773430309d83151dcb8944616132","c05ea8ff4cabd1a0b6239b1a971e40f9d817abfb","18f58df3c789abf98328da0aab6e3611d7286590","ff3dc920c8af4b1b767cde7b7021f92b94b26cc6","e702e3362aac885c723c1312365aca442bb0be13","0086f24e45aa961eac26a741af62e5d706656284","1386d5bcaa1f148178014d934fc99c8d7447a56e","2bbba193ee3c5391566506d2d9e5e796616b39ce","f271097a6063480c01a30898a60d168700d8d57f","ef502010c0318d99bc1b3926cc63cb272e31273e","9d36888a7b8101ddf5c647c3a21ecfefa7d5184a","b3b73388c42ee39100e28b17375a9781fa6ca0aa","756bdc994ba2b25a6ac3784a389a3869178bad29","f34a91b53870ae6b2cf034a28b96f765d1cacbe8","770e16c18589ebabc9596a54cd5eeab8cb8fe62e","e87b2b12b4fe48f9901d3612a9ecf97eaf97f89a","f650f52fa6b8113ac3cf35730cfbce9fef4d19b8","8cc36b0fdf8c2c855d8b7587d890c152bafd1c9c","0954184fec94178ede74f616c3f318b7d38b4391","d65edfe2fb8127587cc0051cd20f220e3a2f2554","8af9fca7ac5c60de95ed5aa8cb94b0ce99bad316","69578d8160dcec4965adee089235b4eff5557046","7721b5629e829e8d2bffe6c526c9736fbf8218ae","4b69b7592e6d01d3de185dcfd13dc0577e8343f2","a5a5c8959320632b3c34077df426847847e6ca7d","7a82d5b0985a796748fd6cb85a05e7798545b1c7","c7f2d9e081f371da49bed0e285e17f62f07ff898","c22b3d73d2893e329e05d9619ed4f619cadddbbb","fe2ae880d4cb5899ec68308803de458c99375a77","38ca5d3a781bdfb0793ec80eff998a9c8f21729c","fa5dfb7ace7840d15146c99f32aec42b2f292c19","057f2a1c035d120f6b2dbdfa926da6dff9c082e9","8afe46f404b9b460c3466179301310f7ea372cbf","3f296c5985f23bb8091dd73beb3b3d454155c119","37b2ef3a29ede94b43f0e0767130ac47b526eebf","634c0c19690e136a727fb5bb820912ac6e5e37c0","1bf2e83f44c0a32e8de8c7ccbaa3341d1dd70d02","6925b78f8d8a533ddbb4d64077f8636c9bd0e578","25badc676197a70aaf9911865eb03469e402ba57","f59a08be36c8ed859fc419824cb51065d549189a","f0ef7cb6e09bc8440735449d8955fed5445b1ed4","e7a8f3e32075bc227ce9bfeb9ec3cc3dc6f66e7a","94db14b0ab4b8400df11d67670d48db241d4c843","6bb4de5cf72afbc249b3636e018b9378fbf4f8fe","145127270cac587a3f62a401244454c47e514d7d","1fd1c05f40b64c1cba71221d88a08f25ebe0e9d2","d9855904500d93bb69c8a94afa30e89bbb52628d","1eb95045beea836cc029de2b609e483abb5b497c","7e8c28097cc50b74bd54886719f6987c7277de99","488355b9218649a36ea0fc8303696e383a3eb791","0caf9a5214212d64fae319d9af26b70fae6d7e87","993695b43588db96fb1205d919f7fc6ef6654e16","acb471a1a2a2aa173f6864a2ff4c023692cbc98d","ab0019fd3944ccaeea72a28e17501e9147647abe","7e04c118f2f1fcf39a30e9baa51acdd6dbb896c3","0c06505aa991c5db9bea3c315bdd42999a41124a","208dccdb94f93eb236953f672bb937b2e57aac3a","6ca27b479468d806dd7806928677683aec2d3c14","2bf4d427314921d1f14fac02c86929dff74c1a3c","2d700681825d72d4248d1a4e1371fb3825ed1706","82fbe767f80a64a3d0876df6c78081d220f63216","3e227e367a8c5d39cd7f954a8522af17f1d4d09a","0120d5db42d7aa6e340a5f7ce80e8b79b45a2147","e2e5ad3d835569914213aba7d80cea7b3ff882ed","a0cd00c2b2550794c312e106457185eb3d93dfad","ba65d58aa1288f98ed1cc2ff6e4628ce78da8820","8054a39390eb91e99abe69745ddb2d617cd3de35","f21cb2b73c51eec4b8042ccbe9746e0861e44de0","39d95ad50a3480f58f11716f880cd0eb955445c8","0c768aa6fe3ef44834697626541efa15e6430cb2","905acb8a999310b2fc59e4cc8e33415cc8013079","792ec1fca65ada2ee787f2cc4f8bce591930ed22","63ddb39a7ae38a662c57dd931ce46f1b0b5e12a8","12f275ff0e0b45452416afef5d4617230323ffd0","211bbbaf06a0f707002b03c07a23a2fe8735135f","f41a334dba238236a21cdde4f6a929bb3a70fca7","37ab33d05e50b85ad7a54ff2c6af398f6312d6fd","9999400a0d78294af41d1d5df7997a1276ab4a0c","6ec33e355ce49bcbc8382f3954b8a529b3c6d341","0d4442407cad8aa7ac28f7537ba0f47e6b616167","783f557f53f88c85b7d39fe637f59d09f7f404f0","00b7f44857676600805172e99be6f9f2987e98eb","6a0175f140b666d196511fa1cb122020e182c562","086c596a93e4e272c6e1491e461925898fab83f1","2337a7983a6e2837aeaa49dbcf45adebf5f16f9c","d6d4ae9e9e3eb63599accbe15260033775a03a6b","0102dad4f34f98245d2c85fbd92d6f78d3fde324","4539c81d9c93d21d95ae7acc13d0c30b26913c74","792fec9ba1be6b80dec5bd78c0f954583621856d","f09a69621f94e9ca06c0e8f877d4e6e2ae3c3488","e4fdec0c891100cd68afb134e0b075e78347eca7","e0d729c8e14e73c3901005de51e9e25681a7ff2d","d53ab3a116251a637265668cfb890958f1cd8694","e18e819962d801bd87e3ea6f64eb530ae0989d23","f67289987187f9dca39edb295e5e9deab48bbd91","4b28f7abb736b82931806be92ed875417237f329","7dd2d85c5e4dbf3411d700416b7a8e1b4f48d34b","d86c8cc635a427ed2aa27003fe5bd7b647e67c91","c5eb3e078a5409c9362d7f4bdde997401bf6de40"],"title":"The Graphical Lasso: New Insights and Alternatives","doi":"10.1214/12-EJS740"}

Despite the best efforts of generations of statisticians and numerical analysts, maximum likelihood estimation and restricted maximum likelihood estimation of variance component models remain numerically challenging. Building on the minorization-maximization (MM) principle, this paper presents a novel iterative algorithm for variance components estimation. Our MM algorithm is trivial to implement and competitive on large data problems. The algorithm readily extends to more complicated problems such as linear mixed models, multivariate response models possibly with missing data, maximum a posteriori estimation, and penalized estimation. We establish the global convergence of the MM algorithm to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point and demonstrate, both numerically and theoretically, that it converges faster than the classical EM algorithm when the number of variance components is greater than two and all covariance matrices are positive definite.","inCitations":["d65a53c37d2cda3e484c53b1bdd0f71eb5980d17","5d0f9a2765131dfb1bfbfc58199294da338117ee","579dc463cb04309ab3916679e53d6d1eb6189fb8","37a67228271527037c9250ae3fd220199275e42e","9f9b935def1aaac336d9cb96a58bb3d99df4dfab","c5c26a04a841db34f9b0db67d72e5d0c6ea223ef","b2f70d6945ec31ea10b90afc8e8043495e652199","cf2e5825fd622d003956a0a479ec2a86f6191e66"],"title":"MM Algorithms For Variance Components Models.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2018.1529601"}

In some applications, the covariates of interest have a natural structure, such as that of a matrix, at the time of collection. The rows and columns of the covariate matrix then have certain physical meanings, and they must contain useful information regarding the response. If we simply stack the covariate matrix as a vector and fit a conventional logistic regression model, relevant information can be lost, and the problem of inefficiency will arise. Motivated from these reasons, we propose in this paper the matrix variate logistic (MV-logistic) regression model. The advantages of the MV-logistic regression model include the preservation of the inherent matrix structure of covariates and the parsimony of parameters needed. In the EEG Database Data Set, we successfully extract the structural effects of covariate matrix, and a high classification accuracy is achieved.","inCitations":["2d1c8a111f83f8c5493fddcbb8b819f1898957c7","03e2ba1bc02d230661adfcda9ed2953fb2d7f741","0f104491e67d4e2e811ff9658e605b9df0c06623","a9823d2ea922ff355d6e7b8aaa0885d28088a624","5b9bd30d51b5e0b9f80018dba89bf027e44668fd","720868fd626061553d92d968bb807d41d3516d4b","b6fcaed5c354bc7ca285dffb5f6b7a661183a195","e702da6dd47efa254743aacc90aa690a35e614cc","9451ad82c559c0f1cd4e942783214697238d1714","2c04d25839b0a6e8371bc854502cfb26929ca882","dcdb82feb29b39cb0f3dc35c11acf7e7e0554aa8","2b45253d9450028e52b7a4cd6e69bf23414a1f1a","12f275ff0e0b45452416afef5d4617230323ffd0","de5aaf356660344a21dd11be16e9b93b83e48cd9","66112f92c52cde13376f791d0b44643c34522316","9f599b589c2baf129f21303c219e9e6e1eb8b9b6","5f4b6737cc7e49d48a1a49ab379b7979bbce30d1","38949268a6295576d6b9c344cc06f92eee33353a","efe171338b74aebdeeb8fb32b184d60f9178abda","8f3157a5ca2955d2fb66e4d8c6348be204134728","abe1a01d68083d8ed4e5236cfe2f9749b6d0bc8f","8c4017f242acb090980dc2db75ee9e51f3f5a240","60a350808a637fcee09fcb726e617db1948249cc","c772094987f725c428ef4fdd7bf36623b5fd3adc","852630188b10b5ff4eb69a2c0808f9207817d93a","0706e295daf8cfc21328606d5bd9508f2b689856"],"title":"Matrix variate logistic regression model with application to EEG data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs023"}

Existing meta‐analysis methods of diagnostic tests (MA‐DT) have been focused on evaluating the performance of a single test by comparing it with a reference test. The increasing number of available diagnostic instruments for a disease condition and the different study designs being used have generated the need to develop efficient and flexible meta‐analysis framework to combine all designs for simultaneous inference. In this article, we develop a missing data framework and a Bayesian hierarchical model for network MA‐DT (NMA‐DT) and offer important promises over traditional MA‐DT: (i) It combines studies using all three designs; (ii) It pools both studies with or without a gold standard; (iii) it combines studies with different sets of candidate tests; and (iv) it accounts for heterogeneity across studies and complex correlation structure among multiple tests. We illustrate our method through a case study: network meta‐analysis of deep vein thrombosis tests.","inCitations":["c7972cfeb358a5298142f4c52bc161802f406f65"],"title":"A Bayesian hierarchical model for network meta‐analysis of multiple diagnostic tests","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx025"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2017,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"We study the properties of treatment effect estimate in terms of odds ratio at the study end point from logistic regression model adjusting for the baseline value when the underlying continuous repeated measurements follow a multivariate normal distribution. Compared with the analysis that does not adjust for the baseline value, the adjusted analysis produces a larger treatment effect as well as a larger standard error. However, the increase in standard error is more than offset by the increase in treatment effect so that the adjusted analysis is more powerful than the unadjusted analysis for detecting the treatment effect. On the other hand, the true adjusted odds ratio implied by the normal distribution of the underlying continuous variable is a function of the baseline value and hence is unlikely to be able to be adequately represented by a single value of adjusted odds ratio from the logistic regression model. In contrast, the risk difference function derived from the logistic regression model provides a reasonable approximation to the true risk difference function implied by the normal distribution of the underlying continuous variable over the range of the baseline distribution. We show that different metrics of treatment effect have similar statistical power when evaluated at the baseline mean.

Classification problems with this hierarchical, nested structure have not received the same statistical understanding as the general classification problem. Some heuristic approaches have been developed and a few authors have proposed formal statistical models. We focus on the problem where heterogeneity exists between the macro-level objects within a class. We propose a model-based statistical methodology that models the log-odds of the macro-level object belonging to a class using a latent-class variable model to account for this heterogeneity. The latent classes are estimated by clustering the macro-level object density estimates. We apply this method to the detection of patients with cervical neoplasia based on quantitative cytology measurements on cells in a Papanicolaou smear. Quantitative cytology is much cheaper and potentially can take less time than the current standard of care. The results show that the automated quantitative cytology using the proposed method is roughly equivalent to clinical cytopathology and shows significant improvement over a statistical model that does not account for the heterogeneity of the data.","inCitations":["c74fb7374e32fa7359304e9e6e829e2a98dc91eb","666c4f79a64ba6bc132ccde0f33e5533b40802c0","3c1c20d2bfda6d59443d7f642ef034b4cfbd28d3","cac9589b0679a4e77ebda463d32206d267eea9bb"],"title":"Classifying tissue samples from measurements on cells with within-class tissue sample heterogeneity.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr010"}

Propensity matching is often used to rectify imbalances among prognostic variables. However, there are no guidelines on how appropriately to analyze group matched data when the outcome is a zero inflated count. In addition, there is debate over whether to account for correlation of responses induced by matching, and/or whether to adjust for variables used in generating the propensity score in the final analysis. The aim of this research is to compare covariate unadjusted and adjusted zero-inflated Poisson models that do and do not account for the correlation. A simulation study is conducted, demonstrating that it is necessary to adjust for potential residual confounding, but that accounting for correlation is less important. The methods are applied to a biomedical research data set.","inCitations":["f823e30010a915a52f4ace89e43dfab124822d7e","c272f8cd48b8ae3041e0332060f8d121d61b6e18","ca15438e9b1b23fa8bad9417fdcfbfe270f2d75f","4b14bbffca4bdc44e31b62b2e3ce29de15f72e8f","ef8328a6a97d3d49256d73a6603e56d6077d1ab4","d12cb2b7894d221b7369054cfa947fea6bdd8962","2503647a944c790d0f62a313382a08e900a53d4e","aa98e4c06d0c1ba6588e3a43176900bb2ae54fe2"],"title":"Analyzing Propensity Matched Zero-Inflated Count Outcomes in Observational Studies.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2013.834296"}

However, few studies fully investigated ensembles of artificial neural networks. In this work, we investigated multiple widely used ensemble methods, including unweighted averaging, majority voting, the Bayes Optimal Classifier, and the (discrete) Super Learner, for image recognition tasks, with deep neural networks as candidate algorithms. We designed several experiments, with the candidate algorithms being the same network structure with different model checkpoints within a single training process, networks with same structure but trained multiple times stochastically, and networks with different structure. In addition, we further studied the over-confidence phenomenon of the neural networks, as well as its impact on the ensemble methods. Across all of our experiments, the Super Learner achieved best performance among all the ensemble methods in this study.","inCitations":["761a1902b5e7758aaccc879c9ec190f99ba21c42","aac4d2cec1170c09f3577a31a27d9dee6b520c63","56dd094cd84facebeb1a987cb799be68a493ad6e","17f2f3f7e58b916175d495109bc74b2757ef952a","78d9c71f88dd2367161bb84853ea21d43e05d86c","46c6498469940fe82045afe59a64eed324665153","0c0e26737fbc27d2dc7aab58783b155b009a06cf","1102ea8cb9632edc25de6d21612d08bb023d0c91","1091729d926c561e27ec99861d84a5edd04fbedb","69a1c81dceba4c7675d8fafec577aec68b763d73","a0e2f2ef55ff28a34f16acf74482c0aab82dfca2","01052e31fce2d6b61507d64daa67f8a25af6f69d","806eff76a0c03e119129c484149cf3d410862f1c","11279333e30a76885ceeeb7152061346252bad5d","a64294de786d18747e385c43d731d068663c04e6","ddfaf745b068f3e0abee95089d99545c659bfc77","d5f2bc947fdef410e1f038b7955121fcbd6fdc77","586bb3f825eb609e88dfa968531974b5aa75273a","7e959c04a7ef0a38235f21a7876e98869595f100","fd5de6c0aedb0ed06d1fc57b5741925f03250fd0","3f470b5c954e6789a1d86296bc22c4010608c31d","9c8d47f85d4b9982c9b9dec42ebd6bc86e8c85ad","1514b95d8c75ac74cb84df2199b6384463738284","b331b55b237e378f5f7a6745617fccd3d3fd32ff","2485c623d48fa5c0662bf06bc74fc54bd93405de","ea14b32a40efe5e530033930cf8fbc256ce813af","775c6a8fbc393b529016f2feb98aa6de60c57264","97ddf85dc2c9a61e113b434ab89a60e56bb53e60","6b568ccefbf92c15e7c4550bfbfe4b64a11bfd08","d3db5bacc1690d0bceaad9b20a67d8acfbe29c73","027b9a21d6ee849b3268c45df10a44cc3d7b7c24","7628147329e2b51be08287d2758afeffc6a52c81","604de32a6d59fe313e1e2eeb7ac56eb419a4d960","f0bb21b93e50066ff010511b30a6e391f621adaf","5552d34933adcc74d0e3ca8cdbb93cfe3b1aaf46","d901577cf2b93f5964999ac014ce1111f2854577","d0df01d1a183d23be8fd638fdb2142280c737e80","aab63e64a3ffa2b31a9b9c4bb045d53fb9d0d411","c85147d279ba2e3360b2a45a68a5c4f1a1f8f625","8691deb10c93e69847f33d7c065645a510ab2ed5","9e1e658f73d71053db0a59c25ee6612154aeefda","35db66ecbaaa6ce3375d5f24fbe86fea598170fb","10f1ad886233a6eb29a55a49597524814520addb","87f191a057d19936c523bd483a604e6aa72b87a6","a7fb585c61f3be9132347ed820fa9805cffa3a8d","e63a57e0d9ac211e80163345ef14380be2b60b9d","83eaa1795404a1cc354d49a08cf71a5ca44c0a9a","f653c06df61308914dbe4b30a51d4c587656c3d4","5b6c60cd8bd3e202d7c5f95803676a9727fcc20b","610875973b81e914258f493035ddb71468d4bccd","b66a4b7cf8e8cced4e192850784000fb96a6896e","f71ac4601dae6b9ce5e41ba0cb18735c11819915","33177363631f70f9cf283a2251292c1cf9c4fba1","ef4fb5547f51262a3f4aa4900e15a748172c970e","c3b558f2255895035d0389fa240edd2811870567","e45c99c70a9e79cf62c348942e11c3774778bf92","833875d02e14750f4a6a249d6f4ad2cc124bcc71","d0d1433f27c90f1128ccd0d3cfe5678655b52224","5190fdd5cd9163316084838cbcd8916facb617b3","b33d4591dd87bd53050542e5d1ac1696188c5f3e","3901f177642912be3fd132807a1e7d16796d1011","bff62c618663a192132fa4f4a12f1aa3007d4ef6","ba0efba16c77cd6ee03596fd39bb0f02ede4d13b","16d3ec32a4de0a75589c667a6b90fa79eb3a38c3","b1982dab79d10348a7026f7492ca70e488025a79","b193ec77b1ca0f906c2e7046ebc5e6ae2f00a32e","de5168baf710e922bb042043c3cd8d2feb411aad","87d48a677fbb75f931a23cc34a57eb662f9aae57","054b8ea3e122a9d4ddfb84ca502f672dd9ca0ca6"],"title":"The Relative Performance of Ensemble Methods with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2018.1441383"}

Using higher-order expansion to quantify the effect of non-normality, four corrected statistics are provided. Two aim to correct the mean bias and two to correct the overall distribution. The classical t-statistic is also robust against non-normality when the observed variables satisfy certain structures. A special case is when the marginal distributions of the contrast are independent and identically distributed.","inCitations":["7057968d9ebd9d6b324bb2ab3541d379f1a1386d","65a9dc02f308dc67c8c0047abef841064a8ce448","f3e84b1f36617a2f393041f934795b1c3ab4e348","5e11dc0652673443920308d40daad6d5f35b3bc7","e09ec6c5c8adb2578d6a054e45b6ee6b166a21ad","ccf66b9c7dcf5207c3ed83ef11f97455f1afef54","6de1e5e90d7eeae7c29cb6caf7cca1d1035fed75","914fd1d9275e47a39632a221d8b0b394c57377e7","05d0a53b54a3b51bc231af2c26df9c78de51af7c","0938d681cb8937359d94f5658a7347a2e6ccf4e7","895edf688d8a6c318d7b9771c9bb0a325e93cd97","0eb14742f1c0352169896d93d6ec81089b20d6de","d207d781d0b4a4940f1671119dc803b4dca18f9b","c7431b670c5c3f4ce5cdf026571ee16af233dd6f","afa63d83a76dccef8e3db11a31ee91b1d4ce859b","333b9f59a8906604f20655c8c0be3c10f14d98c8","d59d9ab3cf07647d40e9f8b37c71146a69088b63","67123f08ba8ffa75126cb68fd6860e5d34494815","4fc343e9d133f154d7d7686a3580b7821806c83b","058e29a182225fa3d9e24932a903d87a69e7626f"],"title":"Four improved statistics for contrasting means by correcting skewness and kurtosis.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X64060"}
