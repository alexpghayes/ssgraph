This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This “unimodal assumption” (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation—estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem—and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures, we introduce the term “local false sign rate” to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.","inCitations":["4ce4dc3b6c55774a754c856f35427804b0562937","8cf8756afae6101ef56c5ea882994380b2b810a9","006e91a9c37de2821800373949b1eb0859b3faab","1f5710879b18a6c5ad1a519bfd82882f56e5e7c6","adab5d2d29c45bf58ab7db945f70f3a4bb41ea4a","ff47e59a7f023ae5b715b64e307d37cc0b6f8cfa","ab92c1462fe721949fbffc64b5a9eb5e4cde4c04","b84d8b195c68b1f6371b001b2494e5d8b0b81912","8144a2091756c96ab9d400e9b9563a297533e2ca","d300653bf4341b409a82525558a5c09eba60157a","da093da7cc2aa81ccba1fb8552c09c46ae11a883","646191f8052b5c1417fde3a4eeeb61b659d12dc8","ccf1664a13cff5e1618c49bde5dddca753ac3fa8","48257528d2d9422d2bf4afa02c203f1d803d7d17","a695e1c0b7c8e1b920008a4b785872024a1aace1","70af1500a0d7baf8de993873d879bdadbbec97fd","011ebd27ea823091c8ed70d17ec54d274ca65009","827656bb3622c867fff708f7f317eee50861e85e","2a5ac91e5c88417bfacaa61bc00afd3572d6393c","0086f24e45aa961eac26a741af62e5d706656284","ec21617e1bc862279aa6f308b7d4d035f8dfb67e","5e7a7c69feaf7bd168dffabd819a5185ab9ada72","92a8b9b0a4f12e8e7cd54828b7eb64d99f8f4d68","fdf5578b445cb5cbd29e798687616ad5e5d4ca2d","bdeb7ac46d5cccbf85f35279700d00fde2f37451","a89288069afba7277524456f2c305f962bcec979","bd4acb3fd591bfcf412bf21bf52d1964281a1271","4c5973970221c98a1948d09152626cb92c96dd58","d9a2982ff7e0055d9974a990d475ab1a65484411","afb445c3b13c66869e81d3e2daa50e42c03eab55","c533039164be3cf53ec356eabf7cf183756d1c1f","1d3edb4d9bb1f0178afca57f0f9ab9c7b9efd1a2","d8e7a03c6ee282130425e170dd3927165aaad1a1","5accedcdd75773b5ef37d97a04ef413b099e7783","b680bc211550d283bc2800eb9db32353364e19dc","82dca3d0694f080f632e821ce596b38fbdc0df3c","e0e91b00908f3e8b0ccf054127f8c29f1ec1851a","db9dbd755cdbaff69066fecc77ae2aef9ef30fca","d6d04501fe89b00725daf955dae3049783a1468b","3b8ea78d3df177ccd4985a85441e393b344f3fa6","779892a85e82bf94018afee26033b895603a3341","8eff09e49cf6fe38ff099753b6ee72a862eaa9a1","1515c0c4bac9a06576d7b62d55c1cb6bc9295e9f","9710de6071e2afad2f29cccc620439a89aef110d","af7560f1def9b88f4ba83dcc5c6c58031e1f5eb7","fbcbc34c1e9bcc1e3164c3d9150dcd09d5956330","ca204b74bbd9edda115545dfbb6e66f1a5f56d40","5f2dfd7e47c1e8f5a6b3a034d30e25527611df08","cdc341859859dcb7ae5a040b1ee54635bff20ad9","582f85f0248c1496ae067cdb6cf2b6f9f134d929","25552dbcc85336d13ad08cbeafe52598419b169f","72ba07964ac688a72fa08751932c8dbfb371c64f","a8674c86a3a27e7fdabdf7406ee14fb4e487dfed","a7f907c4bf7c49418e3c9a3427a00948410f11e4","0d41d495210e403bba5bd33bd52fdf8429592c0a"],"title":"False discovery rates: a new deal","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041"}

Sample size estimates are shown to decrease with increasing within-subject correlations. It is further shown that when clinical trial designs are balanced in group sizes, the sample size required to detect an effect size for a three-way interaction is exactly fourfold that required to detect the same effect size of a two-way interaction. Furthermore, this fourfold relationship virtually holds for unbalanced allocations of subjects if one factor is balanced in the three-way interaction model.

Most often an additive excess hazard model is employed, which assumes that each person's hazard is a sum of 2 components--the population hazard obtained from life tables and an excess hazard attributable to the specific condition. Usually covariate effects on the excess hazard are assumed to have a proportional hazards structure with parametrically modelled baseline. In this paper, we introduce a new fitting procedure using the expectation-maximization algorithm, treating the cause of death as missing data. The method requires no assumptions about the baseline excess hazard thus reducing the risk of bias through misspecification. It accommodates the possibility of knowledge of cause of death for some patients, and as a side effect, the method yields an estimate of the ratio between the excess and the population hazard for each subject. More importantly, it estimates the baseline excess hazard flexibly with no additional degrees of freedom spent. Finally, it is a generalization of the Cox model, meaning that all the wealth of options in existing software for the Cox model can be used in relative survival. The method is applied to a data set on survival after myocardial infarction, where it shows how a particular form of the hazard function could be missed using the existing methods.","inCitations":["d2acbf5df6d9c97445d743cf7d259a11530c1047","3f314db0464ce766312a80c35681a259db63ed2c","92c363e3f3efa6846dc06c5154ddce5bbdd50e79","9df13056a7eaa9e6d99b4856273185f2cbf4ef5e","82bef9c112cfc3e8d41abbd2f39795cc12ee38a0","9b8266a5db070439772f76995ae8fe385ac45591","d739aa1671f38b114bd07acbfa3e1795e2fb1959","c758ecbf7b01cbdba037400c7a12ab9424640ac5","153c947792e44e7f8315c50fede6a0d4e111cc70","f4522b1f4099dc0a927a284ea59c4a1f38b703ad","8939e6e9afedc105c4beba46c2b5b0dd90fe620f","77f23b59b67c07c6c2c36613078315f81c96cb99","d392c41f03d2b00cbda7ee370e52da68c72744a9","48218be3c780c6af12123feb845feaaa3c44c740","345a52db8ea037a7686d83e6407c1d0c66161966","e0c1121a28c4cfc048be2981efa5921e17b34725","59105f011caa203dda139d75089a96099063200f","fd6dde33437e6ec20187baa22053758ee8a10966","1bbe7d27cb9d7fd4ba1b6cc25ee518029e1c94db","44fb92343aa55614e4a39c1221c2368ffe0acc88","7d16979dd9ce8e29b0cc679917861ba2dac68bbe","0621b7707b0a22fb14b3618283ecf62ee92b0e51","82f8d2f274ef03887b593bb958166eb4d31a98cb","cdcc22f281e8785067a2ccfbfe0e283acd671aa7","7d5ff147da42fd9f3e5b933ae654fd2e7a21d684","e1270219a5d1e09a045fac9f00d8df9c0c994cdb","fea75c870c5f2f21f8e0f10135d1ac28d40e0c26","44b6db0b306fa4c6a6925361a500bb215ecfcb31","6ec04b5a016a6e3da8eb74ece9e12dfacec478ca","58e039fc49c32b19c7d4ad3aa8cae865979fbf22","de50d32351ebda3745c39a84f26f5451419a9994","54b37e414a2c5fc59dabbf7fa2f44823ce05cb58","7ef2ea7d861a34ad6993444a65b99d5e8a7f5eea","7be654d57d14b4e9dff00f7813a88016ff3ae9f0","45c6725d176088ce5598b91982c0f749f39f8e00"],"title":"An approach to estimation in relative survival regression.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn021"}

Various estimators are proposed that accommodate cohort or case-control study designs. Performances of the estimators are compared using simulation studies. The methods are illustrated by comparing a lung function measure and a nutritional status measure for predicting subsequent onset of major pulmonary infection in children suffering from cystic fibrosis. For continuous markers, the DLR function is mathematically related to the slope of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, an entity used to evaluate diagnostic markers. We show that our methodology can be used to estimate the slope of the ROC curve and illustrate use of the estimated ROC derivative in variance and sample size calculations for a diagnostic biomarker study.","inCitations":["76c3ae6b58f3c3504ef9f2327568d10cd6b64080","0ad62396efbc5320ef4468b00f392e4731968404","22418cbe62ba8a9027a5e91da1f5d407d436d750","404ca6315a285f35c3bc6efefc69e866687072ba","89dda837e2c3d83d061b893de7e1233dd94c1bf6","33242a7109fa275bc3abbef90a47d69e37df7f4a","0df3acc478cb61e44ae24617570a78c7c8abaf7a","50ca09148389d484e88d612c94b79fb1bfa6a38d","1df41233f33f3b7e8dbeda5b56f9a05c35abadd3","32cab18ff16274bfbb691bd81b811ef7ddf94395","288d61766ac2f2fc4200176759bca56df9d14624","bf669a36a237675a4ad93dd1f9a9f874a07cf675","80f1347b2c5335026cf3c1b163b7bb95a05ebfbe"],"title":"Estimating the diagnostic likelihood ratio of a continuous marker.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxq045"}

Observational studies are well suited for the investigation of the effects of dynamic treatment regimes because of the variability in treatment decisions found in them. This variability exists because different physicians make different decisions in the face of similar patient histories. In this article we describe an approach to estimate the optimal dynamic treatment regime among a set of enforceable regimes. This set is comprised by regimes defined by simple rules based on a subset of past information. The regimes in the set are indexed by a Euclidean vector. The optimal regime is the one that maximizes the expected counterfactual utility over all regimes in the set. We discuss assumptions under which it is possible to identify the optimal regime from observational longitudinal data. Murphy et al. (2001) developed efficient augmented inverse probability weighted estimators of the expected utility of one fixed regime. Our methods are based on an extension of the marginal structural mean model of Robins (1998, 1999) which incorporate the estimation ideas of Murphy et al. (2001). Our models, which we call dynamic regime marginal structural mean models, are specially suitable for estimating the optimal treatment regime in a moderately small class of enforceable regimes of interest. We consider both parametric and semiparametric dynamic regime marginal structural models. We discuss locally efficient, double-robust estimation of the model parameters and of the index of the optimal treatment regime in the set. In a companion paper in this issue of the journal we provide proofs of the main results.","inCitations":["cbaadd6101a1fc7babdcc7fbe7d551fad1a9d154","a87a3fa676215843641ad02ff51596fe5d5757cd","6e88eb76ee5bd663e3c89bb86973b711c573aa1e","847092dc01d5b5f65b596cd880e906dbeb60134c","e5d164890b6930256f84639be76ba0b4807169d4","0e3a80473a17528fb5c82386e2f8f06ea4dcc56f","5248380a6ece676c23fb8eba3d747e72f8108033","9a3b46613d5374ce7366e1208324d1731399b890","6ae9e0603007cd002f6afead7029bed9b2b3a002","99bd33c676f13eed1b6282e7d8aff43646442a63","59e7551f5b6ffde5cc9f8f2e29bd3c6fae1f4155","7e3a774fec771559adfe5cbe89867ec2d9a66cc3","abb8112e9bbf80be174212d6e920863d6d7df560","574e8ceee80a6907f1918c7e647325f74f5530e3","eacc1ac1ab35d650e50973e34b447c652ca4c408","611d2b955143d2c9ef10b2b169775cb05b53b748","e96d06351525051f6df82dd7ab3c17cc9e08b4c8","2d6498913050f5935674c2f7d2911fdeae2129b3","c6706c9084e870737fc415555c529c29bc5e188f","27c6d95ab651a15ce916d6a1f42201f746def051","13e5e5598db443874b80799a831b096b6f31c709","7bd59f30c6e70ca47e626a91dc4308a93aa86072","40f17e05103639d8e9fd3ad57b18758f026206d2","4f13b0a1fdf68c0cb3bd46b040231e03dae7ac15","f3042208d7d1b01cd05dd06e386425b3bf53f019","8b7d772bb655c4e94f6c7426875c9b4f0cb4a5f0","f345afc1837b1a358bc0578d467ef683c74179aa","7d1fbe5989207a9b18e34ac5fc48c9c958a0c07f","65903f9ded33d93e5369cb521b19b61ab2da8efb","b10d75fd4a2ed327ae0e40acaffea67734b3eb87","4107685a4dee6647100f82ae02bbd4fe662dbe7b","e568a265747151e23e6db7ae64437dd854385fcb","c0deb95677b425d20bb57f340ddbe00ce1d4aeb8","cea5a78f75446bfda4128fa588cea52d9fff3fe4","f19257ac730be56a293af5dfa742a40be4c97482","b0680decae33bcba664a761663b99168b4f9aa39","f7966ebf09747b24358804338102db8f423778f8","a502f93c63954ee77e8b7275799e95203b41356e","69e4f1105e57f3bdd80056c6c11d786eb7b8f36a","d5ce026a664cc6fc7ef35dbc37cdb2a4f93ab77a","5a4722972f1449a86ffe9fa4df345f0313236fd4","f942609d91e6ab62fb7034d34624b9380113bbaa","029ec072ace1d487669a38629347fd141466dad7","a6d1916ef5b91212063e6d8ae9d68f87f45125f7","1001ca294f6a9124aa548b532bc3bc550964635a","4b5ab0890937d6b44ed8a816bc27b45b3b557cd3","47d05f12f4243f0eabfad6fe66add96810cbdb43","e33caeb68e69b33345e1cd9ec9a747cb11c5af0c","8873179d6b8b70378d83315d08db5bc20533205b","f21ca73c36354f2fcf1b3d0fb283951c58f3c831","2172fd75b7e6e8db47d8f709ceda45c60029363a","d9717c53d893c435be06205f0893cf9dae78b04c","cca1eb40ab2eebb09959d665f9033bbe9cb3206c","764b113c9b04d2c10a2494db8d3bfa6885d97860","afd9cc8b618d998e92e9d5bb2b18db2aa9050ffa","5c8f568080e1f7a1f0b7c7844c9c0fe2f664d4f3","ac7b38c7eb07f234b2fdc0360c5a48aa35f273ab","23f801b22fba75a11d47f34efb9bea184fa2843e","620af58eaa251370cc07b6c954716da22e84a12e","aaa127441bc2a0c40e0f92babed3ee9ba22a9df6","4170b59e19369d5704df22c92f9fb5666c60e184","cb8500f6e8c9b7200f16f1ab147fdc617af2f15b","b634bfa3f51c69ecadf627a316aded489d460067","959c04545adae3962aaf712af92106ec27a87207","23f7e78fa75d7634179c698b53e07a4ee12d1ccd","431584e9ea07504d9c3a41582e6466053d7bdc4c","0e739d92688a413b0eeb693817543372bd4acc7e","eed2fd6e55c61e9de6631f7fd987e094b0e58530","b7168ba6706836178b8ef4a850d281f33fc0bc89","fba18acdfb6a0be3f4e174bd95663bdcfa119d58","7222683e5a35cbe02ae85e2eff6f8bf053de75c9","9d4efb506eb72dbe45452186a59a40bbf51b41a8","cab32454fdfcf495d021f1d0b961e18cf31532cc","2d65a44e3e89836daae7950125b0f1ab31198b78","5de7761067a3a3909c28b42d931aff78caf7ea1e","88c1c9c9f71c8cc8755aeeed15ddde43f274f8f7","8e8b74f49b6cabde2ce36cf90653758d9186f1c6","2edc363b9b5ac16c7eac6e57950c8ad8bbb95cd6","ec05c514460c9c165365690d7cd0174dea98df90","2b35cf0951c2d17d8ed8b805afbee9f89ee7caf5","49ff23bf9908cf101b16700b7efe14164011eadb","f830716e01267158f333c69d68f25c392a3629ac","a05a18567dc5e3d7797e8a5630d8fd22eae8ae0d","0eaa526ef29c6644d97c7628cfe8a37a72e69fdb","ee08e5f50ee8d9674518f5f6f62cfac73ce8055b","b6ae481f46ddc7f67f5fc0ab052c7dad78357699","62893f1a72dace3d4cc40736ebdf4a53fc793df0","f4d0ccacd7b2f8c7ec7566924bce74734e82c0d7","8cdcfd333961b3209e05de5ed8a48741a878ae16","db5043638485d7203aec46bd367fda6fcfdb0f3f","99f0066af00e2d5e27127133f87383ce26d89864","e7d278af006f2b34dc93a613b0c44dcb824c72cc","f76aee5e2204833e12a87734f4098e0da1c2fd34","ef93d9cb099adf706de21e5f83bd48e23d2099ab","82bfd3aa19fe3ce5a4f14103fb3f0ecb15d198d9"],"title":"Dynamic Regime Marginal Structural Mean Models for Estimation of Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes, Part I: Main Content","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1200"}

Our motivation is inference of gene regulatory networks from low-resolution microarray time series, where existence of nonlinear interactions is well known. Parenthood relations are mapped by augmenting the model with kinship indicators and providing these with either an overall or gene-wise hierarchical structure. Appropriate specification of the prior is crucial to control the flexibility of the splines, especially under circumstances of scarce data; thus, we provide an informative, proper prior. Substantive improvement in network inference over a linear model is demonstrated using synthetic data drawn from ordinary differential equation models and gene expression from an experimental data set of the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian rhythm.","inCitations":["4222244099a9b84752a07dc02e446494025f7642","25660603dc04e89b9d78b2512e69132101adb18b","9deb0dcad2ae9a1b6ff78f0801457b764a64d624","49ad0c7d943bb65bc42bd9e9b10924619f17334e","a95e28e2640c6dcb572b2d0dfbedb56cd0519600","0923c7bff280dc923d518bd3dcfb98c37b3762ea","c019ff93f19851b795f28b23dd5b6f872402f78b","ee6f6351a8308cbb254858debbab622196798436","b6e15e662c6165dba465a4de4158a878ebefc15d","82fe5ae02db9efa37f99cf77da4c856ddbc1bca8","cf300a88fc374306306e94e9359f8daec348cb5c","bd8c7a448c351ecd0e5b695285b4857a21ac9abc","44aa72bd8b5b63da2ed20db996258f89baceba66","36d3c76de159d48b3d4f85b7cdc20c23a092a833","de62b4a4e3f54b1b283a979651589769d2da38ca","9d8350832952459a44607a51f902714efaf47f16","1563610928f5aa44cfc5c53bfa9bebe6b6c3e019","dcb7e37ed57105c5abe61e2572d274823dd1ba5a","e9fa8a39d64b6c6e8c5de71742355129d4623e7b","ba7fee5e6ecad786d58b738c840a71aea9335119","156e16dcb9e0fe51344ffe9c64933e89d09e076a","4a87362da9093be1382fc4e314eff278d8aeb0d8","48c63325780c17330f832458923f8446da6d9163","02196ac722bc0ef8841d7c179e3b5fd40eefe647","6deb8bb411260ad994c624e5c249fe9998e8c96b","b3c3d0b14bdee7accfbfd7270e1717cedfd5eafb"],"title":"Inferring the time-invariant topology of a nonlinear sparse gene regulatory network using fully Bayesian spline autoregression.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr009"}

One approach to deal with such issues is to consider the principal strata effect (PSE, or equally, the survivor average causal effect). PSE is defined as the effect of treatment on the outcome among the subpopulation that would have been selected under either treatment arm. Unfortunately, the PSE cannot generally be estimated without the identifying assumptions; however, the bounds can be derived using a deterministic causal model. In this paper, we propose a number of assumptions for deriving the bounds with narrow width. The assumptions and bounds, which differ from those introduced by Zhang and Rubin (2003), are illustrated using data from a randomized prostate cancer prevention trial.","inCitations":["b13ca22164620729ade497a756b248ab1678ec85","8a5a63aee29045884de71283b875092325942834","55e5580025bc24357458d1abe015e3193044e559","d772a781116d64c4c30145c921f3ccd7e12bf1f2","ab99b239bc2ee3161e6a0ff0b0e23909db6ea18a","88873ba699a4bec9aa8f164856c01079fa453621","4b71483833b7f52a0ec7eedf8140388fcddb6929","f9377450f07844a55062337b3d431c7fd1065f39"],"title":"The Large Sample Bounds on the Principal Strata Effect with Application to a Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1365"}

Based on the corresponding new concepts of coverage and mutual exclusivity, new methods can be designed for de novo discovery of mutated driver pathways in cancer. Since the computational problem is a combinatorial optimization with an objective function involving a discontinuous indicator function in high dimension, many existing optimization algorithms, such as a brute force enumeration, gradient descent and Newton's methods, are practically infeasible or directly inapplicable. We develop a new algorithm based on a novel formulation of the problem as non-convex programming and non-convex regularization. The method is computationally more efficient, effective and scalable than existing Monte Carlo searching and several other algorithms, which have been applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We also extend the new method for integrative analysis of both mutation and gene expression data. We demonstrate the promising performance of the new methods with applications to three cancer datasets to discover de novo mutated driver pathways.","inCitations":["c2dad8a02f687b4431c9c133579b560fb302380d","8eaa6c8acfdb87537b92f3befbfbcd776d70c2c3"],"title":"A Novel and Efficient Algorithm for De Novo Discovery of Mutated Driver Pathways in Cancer.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1042"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"In determining dose limiting toxicities in Phase I studies, it is necessary to attribute adverse events (AE) to being drug related or not. Such determination is subjective and may introduce bias. In this paper, we develop methods for removing or at least diminishing the impact of this bias on the estimation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The approach we suggest takes into account the subjectivity in the attribution of AE by using model-based dose escalation designs. The results show that gains can be achieved in terms of accuracy by recovering information lost to biases. These biases are a result of ignoring the errors in toxicity attribution.","inCitations":["da5eefeacc1b1a2a8b50856e22615072596b4eb2","94df5339fcf7c1f1b97af4470b895af178beb300","54f3519aa79ab76e19836b3af0e6e32eb8f4fa16"],"title":"Phase I Designs that Allow for Uncertainty in the Attribution of Adverse Events.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12195"}

For time series data with nonparametric time trend, we study the change-point problem for the autocovariance structure of the unobservable error process. To derive the asymptotic distribution of the cumulative sum test statistic, we develop substantial theory for uniform convergence of weighted partial sums and weighted quadratic forms. Our asymptotic results improve upon existing works in several important aspects. The performance of the test statistic is examined through simulations and an application to interest rates data.","inCitations":["6844bda9bba0395d094638f38e5720f5b663ed0c","96d565039e2d13837048548765fc5ed92f429d87"],"title":"Testing for changes in autocovariances of nonparametric time series models.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2012.07.012"}

These methods, which include the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty and the minimax concave penalty (MCP), have been demonstrated to have attractive theoretical properties, but model fitting is not a straightforward task, and the resulting solutions may be unstable. Here, we demonstrate the potential of coordinate descent algorithms for fitting these models, establishing theoretical convergence properties and demonstrating that they are significantly faster than competing approaches. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of convexity diagnostics to determine regions of the parameter space in which the objective function is locally convex, even though the penalty is not. Our simulation study and data examples indicate that nonconvex penalties like MCP and SCAD are worthwhile alternatives to the lasso in many applications.

Sensitivity is the probability of a positive result, once the individual is truly ill, and specificity is the probability of a negative result, regarding a healthy individual. These measures are obtained by comparing the test outcome and the results of a reference test generically denominated gold standard. However, in many applied problems considering two diagnostic tests, the gold standard is not available for those individuals with negative results on both tests. In addition, not all diagnostic tests have the same performance across different populations. In this context, we present a Bayesian inference approach for performance measures estimation and we propose an extension of this procedure involving the inclusion of covariates. This Bayesian approach is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The conditional dependence between the diagnostic tests was considered. As an example, we applied the proposed methodology to a real data set obtained from the medical literature.","inCitations":["dd192709771971204586c35f6a23238bbbd6a62b","f28b880968cc3e4a322ba21bb2aff6fe03736f72","27b4e44ef60c87e2314ef562d1d8a525ed817b33","3a5cc6ff44df63c51d4fad84095463afc5a327e7","fe40f5f7484253468bed71dd7af6659bce5b60d6"],"title":"Bayesian estimation of diagnostic tests accuracy for semi-latent data with covariates.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200067912"}

We use expectation-maximization variable selection (EMVS) with a deterministic annealing variant as the platform for our method, due to its proven flexibility and efficiency. We propose a variance adjustment of the priors for the coefficients of qualitative covariates, which controls false-positive rates, and a flexible parameterization for interaction terms, which accommodates user-specified heredity constraints. This method can handle all pairwise interaction terms as well as a subset of specific interactions. Using simulation, we show that this method selects associated covariates better than the grouped LASSO and the LASSO with heredity constraints in various exploratory research scenarios encountered in epidemiological studies. We apply our method to identify genetic and non-genetic risk factors associated with smoking experimentation in a cohort of Mexican-heritage adolescents.","inCitations":["2bdf1c1888ea806b277b3817cd83f10d7b92c334"],"title":"Using the EM algorithm for Bayesian variable selection in logistic regression models with related covariates.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2017.1398255"}

The complexity of diagnostic choices when two or more continuous tests are used in sequence is illustrated, and different approaches to reducing the dimensionality are presented and evaluated. For instance, in practice, when a single test is used repeatedly in routine screening, the same screening threshold is typically used at each screening visit. One possible alternative is to adjust the threshold at successive visits according to individual-specific characteristics. Such possibilities represent a particular slice of a receiver operating characteristic surface, corresponding to all possible combinations of test thresholds. We focus in the development and examples on the setting where an overall test is defined to be positive if any of the individual tests are positive ('believe the positive'). The ideas developed are illustrated by an example of application to screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen.","inCitations":["484a5eef0eece93403f1e198852ec3d954e9ada6","fe8847de9324e82cf86e7261863789288b6d9cca","3721ea3f45a56c1a14d27bda3de6550ea4bba0b0","827bc807552cb0c3a58f398cb941fd265215cf29","53bf22d5044b1714339ed1bd2b789fe493a2fe51","9bea6453fe6381d703e6716fc0826e67e6c0d8f8","10f3ddda7379411faa95b2fcc6a88232c726c349","75e70da220d06be00ff6d1cf98efbaaaf42bdbd0","79f680dd3f91e34280e73737968de60f2ff587da","142190c695209302f339f0c22e80bd2380875ed2","944610c5f009f18198fe88bee52f5b4348958dc9","20039a11ebd258e444de76598df9776ae5f3234c","1d3405f5e1cfd84ff163fe7f35b6f5c578358996","dac068aa01adcec09f86009db90e88b7e97829cd","ac3fc64a0c40d1dad4f2ebf4b3dacd8b4bcf156b","9fa0c6041b19724033fa916ff0f7eea72c93ecff","a54350aa2fc605eebcb8599bf1c44fd4bee427f6","8ca6a74bcb9dfb1333c3e5ee9067bd9f55bc5305","cb70eb1e6496d3524ede2392fd4bd6fdb8dbb134","fee4bfc173cdb9f516e07319031d55faa7d9a77a","85003c8519fce4bf5cee5601e09aa6bd6830bc58","663b4fcf7b3184251adddae07274cb91fc648cb3","0d5a008094167593e6a6aa4407e372509e0e42d2","1b5e697e7700b8f961d1f11f1e052c302d5a680a","1a5ffdc75fdc57e430e15a4df8aac8af3b43cac2","1ae2514cf56ad9a965b34a69a8ccd938da438a76","e0fe0f9ac8e7d40d41fe4f835ed48db768b74fe3","05f8f3e4f6dc21a348e2ff01f5289e6852f5689d","6c02c812d6a339c92a4af4510fa6bffb2a424119","6039fec8de8ee42846fbb90b033fb0d27dcf82f5","e46dd038e1d27ab6432fc4e3a7f88d2f4ba1a5ec","c79b181ebb00f546ff4aba10d13ce7b653e2310d","ef90719e75744d008004286894b4cfb13f875c1b"],"title":"Assessing the diagnostic accuracy of a sequence of tests.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.3.341"}

Robins and Greenland (1992) and Pearl (2001) formalized the definition of two types of direct effects (natural and controlled) under the counterfactual framework. The efficient scores (under a nonparametric model) for the various natural effect parameters and their general robustness conditions, as well as an estimating equation based estimator using the efficient score, are provided in Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2011b). In this article, we apply the targeted maximum likelihood framework of van der Laan and Rubin (2006) and van der Laan and Rose (2011) to construct a semiparametric efficient, multiply robust, substitution estimator for the natural direct effect which satisfies the efficient score equation derived in Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2011b). We note that the robustness conditions in Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2011b) may be weakened, thereby placing less reliance on the estimation of the mediator density. More precisely, the proposed estimator is asymptotically unbiased if either one of the following holds: i) the conditional mean outcome given exposure, mediator, and confounders, and the mediated mean outcome difference are consistently estimated; (ii) the exposure mechanism given confounders, and the conditional mean outcome are consistently estimated; or (iii) the exposure mechanism and the mediator density, or the exposure mechanism and the conditional distribution of the exposure given confounders and mediator, are consistently estimated. If all three conditions hold, then the effect estimate is asymptotically efficient. Extensions to the natural indirect effect are also discussed.","inCitations":["6c91be40ebc890f2d689ab26dc44cdd2a0bf308a","e41ec3e175f58057ee65a5bce48057c1eeadbafa","fb721f1a69544c15426c266afcf3c84eed269d9a","d5917a870fd952dac6c64170f0fed99dbb48fac3","013025b1eac9d91e0e8236048bbffecfdcbb0799","9b16be309421179dbe3ac1939503578fafe0af53","9ed811bc491fcce3184847ab44bbc2e2fdd084a9","c14194bb9bc01767eb0f966cc8f8414e069d1c41","3ea7389157feed8b5b8a5aa335817c21b67b1f62","9807061560df3fc3684c9af0d4a010ea21a42dd6","a843250f1637997204b03b27d5ca00992364dc8e","0cda28571694ac39ab22fad256c732f94602b8c2","0d0399390e863392f1d138f4b6cc602f77f1814d","a97a6ad64e20f1fd0a636c1c2d3eeaff1013be57","955442ea309c03b95abb9caf13ea5e5197e2e900","93b213fd336e6d308d1234fd717cc3629283238f","89085a8552ded78a401fe383bd9dd62dd647fcea","9a7bc66aefd0cf953b1e89734ee3a65ed0b291b4","0379c067faddbdf3eafe5f8393cbdad6d60e510d","1d2203c77620e43c0aa050a1b8ed4c229304dfd9","7a592ae91acc5cafcd43bd372f30d63d761b547c","876e9deb18afe91f1145408eea8a6ad3dacf26d3","b669a6fff30ea7be5909e90f33a3767687150486","82170de04a8560a43e1c9366f402ccd57f5438a3","ced474721273dfb177c605f345410af7dcfb967b","d1225abcfc1948811c58e8e8c05f9e4ef664e0b3","5dba30c906420351d57d80e18e625d4c18e951d6","2c7cc63e1263ab5deef9f227a254049e537b05f8","ed9e2083c5b1baab5a26c25a6526d2b4a8b77b59","4b3e0f6976acd8b16ac0f448585a176095bd08fa","1aee87b6b8962bd1673833cd84446118d5fb6caf","5b8f1413fd941b19ed7b1bebbe9d167339f9eeb3","7876ee362e62f8a8572b1cd23f877c7ff67407e8","1be25f3d238c171797ba058cb5411a6355a113d9","7d416d8b6201af8c06e05aa74f7a4ea5f4cdba83","62a641908e65eb1c04b43403d95658dc02515734","284a4329808e7af7ca34f828235e451703e4cbc0","1acfe671c0c8676cb456000c987340b6e5a51fe3","5f561f92ceffeff37b1782a22a19ee86ba597ce9","2172fd75b7e6e8db47d8f709ceda45c60029363a","b0b2c40e5689c5e0f6cf234d2ad48c6151da2efc"],"title":"Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Natural Direct Effects","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1361"}
