A main drawback is the strong parametric assumption about the component densities. In this paper, a much more flexible mixture model is considered, which assumes each component density to be log-concave. Under fairly general conditions, the log-concave maximum likelihood estimator (LCMLE) exists and is consistent. Numeric examples are also made to demonstrate that the LCMLE improves the clustering results while comparing with the traditional MLE for parametric mixture models.","inCitations":["e7eba084a29d599ef27e49c9bb2e96f793bc8359","cf9a2ddcedab668426bb517d03c2a3989056babf","24b7f2ab6705c966405d3ca48bdfaf1cee1ffe19","4e3f4462720e094968ad7dfb37b1a4c762823ffe","eb9261306e3193337694336f1e2859727ec736d5","a542a1eee24e91fee0f306413a5cf3b2bb41a182"],"title":"Maximum likelihood estimation of the mixture of log-concave densities","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2016.03.002"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2004,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"Many robust regression estimators have been proposed that have a high, finite-sample breakdown point, roughly meaning that a large proportion of points must be altered to drive the value of an estimator to infinity. But despite this, many of them can be inordinately influenced by two properly placed outliers. With one predictor, an estimator that appears to correct this problem to a fair degree, and simultaneously maintain good efficiency when standard assumptions are met, consists of checking for outliers using a projection-type method, removing any that are found, and applying the Theil-Sen estimator to the data that remain. When dealing with multiple predictors, there are two generalizations of the Theil-Sen estimator that might be used, but nothing is known about how their small-sample properties compare. Also, there are no results on testing the hypothesis of zero slopes, and there is no information about the effect on efficiency when outliers are removed. In terms of hypothesis testing, using the more obvious percentile bootstrap method in conjunction with a slight modification of Mahalanobis distance was found to avoid Type I error probabilities above the nominal level, but in some situations the actual Type I error probabilities can be substantially smaller than intended when the sample size is small. An alternative method is found to be more satisfactory.","inCitations":["4355f8419ee16298d054190cd5f756491028d232","ab65a419402800c2a98d16548266018e55956e6a","4db21279f00e537410359a2a62fa90200fbe2531","85062d4026dd022b8161d5946c345808df0d7767","51763e5f78fa09ae525211c91095f38ed824ea63","010c4a462fbe05b83c833f81cea8c21a3e310c24"],"title":"Some results on extensions and modifications of the Theil-Sen regression estimator.","doi":"10.1348/0007110042307230"}

This advance has generated data-analytic challenges in proteomics, similar to those created by microarray technologies in genetics, namely, discovery of 'signature' protein profiles specific to each pathologic state (e.g. normal vs. cancer) or differential profiles between experimental conditions (e.g. treated by a drug of interest vs. untreated) from high-dimensional data. We propose a data-analytic strategy for discovering protein biomarkers based on such high-dimensional mass spectrometry data. A real biomarker-discovery project on prostate cancer is taken as a concrete example throughout the paper: the project aims to identify proteins in serum that distinguish cancer, benign hyperplasia, and normal states of prostate using the Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization (SELDI) technology, a recently developed mass spectrometry technique. Our data-analytic strategy takes properties of the SELDI mass spectrometer into account: the SELDI output of a specimen contains about 48,000 (x, y) points where x is the protein mass divided by the number of charges introduced by ionization and y is the protein intensity of the corresponding mass per charge value, x, in that specimen. Given high coefficients of variation and other characteristics of protein intensity measures (y values), we reduce the measures of protein intensities to a set of binary variables that indicate peaks in the y-axis direction in the nearest neighborhoods of each mass per charge point in the x-axis direction. We then account for a shifting (measurement error) problem of the x-axis in SELDI output. After this pre-analysis processing of data, we combine the binary predictors to generate classification rules for cancer, benign hyperplasia, and normal states of prostate. Our approach is to apply the boosting algorithm to select binary predictors and construct a summary classifier. We empirically evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the resulting summary classifiers with a test dataset that is independent from the training dataset used to construct the summary classifiers. The proposed method performed nearly perfectly in distinguishing cancer and benign hyperplasia from normal. In the classification of cancer vs. benign hyperplasia, however, an appreciable proportion of the benign specimens were classified incorrectly as cancer.

Various tests of normality that have been proposed over the years have been found to have limited usefulness, and sometimes a preliminary test makes the situation worse. The present paper investigates a specific and easily applied rule for choosing between a parametric and non-parametric test, the Student t test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, that does not require a preliminary significance test of normality.

Motivated by the annual number of cases of HUS collected in Birmingham and Newcastle of England, respectively, from 1970 to 1989, we consider Bayesian changepoint analysis with specific attention to Poisson changepoint models. For changepoint models with unknown number of changepoints, we propose a new non-iterative Bayesian sampling approach (called exact IBF sampling), which completely avoids the problem of convergence and slow convergence associated with iterative Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The idea is to first utilize the sampling inverse Bayes formula (IBF) to derive the conditional distribution of the latent data given the observed data, and then to draw iid samples from the complete-data posterior distribution. For the purpose of selecting the appropriate model (or determining the number of changepoints), we develop two alternative formulae to exactly calculate marginal likelihood (or Bayes factor) by using the exact IBF output and the point-wise IBF, respectively. The HUS data are re-analyzed using the proposed methods. Simulations are implemented to validate the performance of the proposed methods.","inCitations":["465c27316601bc7b07216efafc7c6728793f3108","03fc43d90846a7081a254267f55e78c7cc4fe6b3","faa5a8a30e062fe2582ba69a35b109a3439adc72","81bce05553e26a3ad1874d76f9486a79b4d80e8c"],"title":"Non-iterative sampling-based Bayesian methods for identifying changepoints in the sequence of cases of Haemolytic uraemic syndrome","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2009.02.006"}

We consider the simplest setting, where 3 tests are observed and conditional independence (CI) is assumed. Closed-form expressions for maximum likelihood parameter estimates are derived. They show explicitly how observed 2- and 3-way associations between test results are used to infer disease prevalence and test true- and false-positive rates. Although interesting and reasonable under CI, the estimators clearly have no basis when it fails. Intuition for bias induced by conditional dependence follows from the analytic expressions. Further intuition derives from an Expectation Maximization (EM) approach to calculating the estimates. We discuss implications of our results and related work for settings where more than 3 tests are available. We conclude that careful justification of assumptions about the dependence between tests in diseased and nondiseased subjects is necessary in order to ensure unbiased estimates of prevalence and test operating characteristics and to provide these estimates clinical interpretations. Such justification must be based in part on a clear clinical definition of disease and biological knowledge about mechanisms giving rise to test results.","inCitations":["caf1437dcab923e2eff0bd3611a4c7d9b5cc6715","28cae5f24a67c5d7f45bf6022302bef60179ff1f","27117df96fe02adcf74771d3dd34f7d2994d9d3d","393bc7eebb10d631bc60c4e56a0311f3257ec246","ad681d84d08785e2b8b3e465dfdbac4393f8013d","baa66ba31575dc22dceee4ad61818af9eb6676b0","eaa07f0ffb2b972938a0952bea9650f44fa69cb1","ee4d4f3ef51c0ddc09f07ae07a355b8a9b552ef6","c51f5ab0fbb1548ebc9ffc12f54647077a7ab09a","ad4c9f6c9f477a776e56d8fddf6301bf9cd03b0c","d86f6228b9d9112f34404b02bcaafa5b81dca5f9","d01153f177d8e7857d227155336d5695c7591082","5b3a64c9a15294672d5d170ed782914bd9e40dd3","96e380e7a5b833ee041fd8d1aee735afa184e87a","a77e15d40bfa049a35539ef0d5ce16757f7a7fdc","674d4e9c2986b89fcd6d587cc0a1a7f3e15d5273","5b579cc9b00bdb0cbdeab3d679e38f43fa11c6a5","052eea197b523cda867d73e532520b3212d8552f","5a0f00279e9cdc702bf5396fdb6adb3fc44e6785","24d1ec03f8443316ba92568896c93eaf35a88cc8","2e94b1b75445ee3699c5a090dac4554ed8e058ed","c19dbb0a70eab7f2acf998663b732689563b2318","75d9517d202645f5ff339cb145c7be3cf79da35d","a7b5782ce4b27c0603353e1629c04b8c71a8897e","25eb9420430bb5db83f702f9140260171b8d7dda","8a21543e4ffabd1aacc8c2181000b9b6fafc626e","03dd2f6a11b699d37cc72d1ede0dadb82ae5fd02","0ee07f2835a8b734ef7db8be585aed02fe1c1537","799d7a0c791128addc357cb6c6f24427f90548c1","ca218067651155088a4320114bf30334cad9a910","b6d70a9f3a686d4a7d7dbd4485cc8ce75dd08f8e","12ab0d1673228b47bf05bd203fe735e3ef7b757d","377b4c00a715d67c286f1ce1293d6712b0088815","2ef932759c454dad6cbf72fdfea051ff45f4bc8f","8db6d303ca3878155ea78e507206949c58a20517","04d2cdb5bc899c24936c076ff7360760aa6b32d3","f465a1b03d8dfa809ec033449d30f79c24621459","ebe6442f6ead20108ef9572486d956a9ebfea46e","25fa56f95ff62fbc25d1abdd7fe15c46048e9ef9","e906552d403c1a7853d4f7c2ccc5f5019bf8210c","ba27fe1a113ed34dbbdbdb0985cc33ec6b9691ba","1e6739e708d50a82e078576b4516fb325217357f","5561cd667d1c1dc44163e04e30331d6a9835515b","ee37ed59f89dba6dc7c6912f3cd3b86a4ae6e0c9","3a5cc6ff44df63c51d4fad84095463afc5a327e7","c7eff4b78b98b5d0d3d8fc15cb3ece2c9321b986","b725c47efe02022f4c53cf90f75dfa34ad17ead3","ab406fa804a206766b1118d0f774def28f2c80e7","aae5c7b60c796df347ed00bfa78aeee45e14d988","5281ede65f81cf0dcbca11326888067b6c5f52d2","f036912fe32ee099d52091b84ceb2e9622b92192","f6d8d611aaa3bbc3cf77c48af1cfba5ee56761db","9c91d022ea02b85bbb1a29f04ace679ddee39c6f","6fadcc4eca5d4e661b1dcdd7e6b04ed5087d7796","a1e4e50ce3307a7f8b94890a0e11dfbd9f04e5ce","3b58e65f0c1b87aee09305c2ba8a524b56f78091","3c2642db2b0cfa805dafe06d76a1b450d08ab8fd","c7572767d2f1ae8ad74d1e278a0cad305916eea2","4db1d972c3a1418463df894344cdf2641f62b2cf","66e10ab033b56c02813d6acb61fc63eea1278d8f","e97cf116b7c2f30dbfc453223da686e9e66e410b","aca990901c286cf83b86900b2306f1f0972dd199","92291624857f24275af336b266d0bfa7124a69bf","1ac8b28fcee2f8c895b5e42e6e76a9864845fd2e","dd63f274210280e6c3ca0e8aa72a1ea4932971e8","385666dbca87c3c12ce00c37d639da4831406d34","9abea7bdecc3611ca4fe2e27d00293456e4570c3","0ffcdd080f0d01ccf462020ca773a63da1bb2ff3","35994dbeba98020974d2e61d0cb671a85a533910","1b2090e0a9e72b9f71f960fd3a5e46e999136b05","92e04023e17660bea6a9f078dae65e3d22f7aabd","510fbfcdef0456faa06ed424c7863035e9ec5877","4d76f1a13dc9fc74efbfb4348993899c1e4b3889","2a0311f8862ddc7107dada18c01c97f5995221cd","c452fadf96a398a581a829974222402035f5ba0b","928877f0de6153dc9b6243d171e004b2b9dc0e0c","de45e142de21c6a73d0279e6be56d011a52b1cb9","26c42c09275026af7515cc25ad913e93726cc7dd","efc94eb21cc5d774cf747df71862d9f27d299e3a","5ab93940102960c88f61c93ed0e074a310b385b8","cfc5b3259b1ca418bf52f7b9af8b8ad211e8cf38","ec4a686652c450abdd1ddedeff0ae1211041fc68","966dafcff1d2aa23f802d68d245c16c3db8eea79","28339f5a0d5e5f9028e6ec258a5edee4cb43dd74","77d2d1c8f422b8a42f969b36e6452c55f9e987b6","37db5a830b7e7aa90f1c81b9ef836e00b7601e5b","114fbc322c51f723cfe76404c5dd30e094b92f61"],"title":"Insights into latent class analysis of diagnostic test performance.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl038"}

This data structure arises in studies under which an intervention is delivered to each client through a sequence of elements which overlap with those of other clients on different occasions. Our interest concentrates on study designs for which the overlaps of sequences occur for clients who receive an intervention in a shared or grouped fashion whose memberships may change over multiple treatment events. Our motivating application focuses on evaluation of the effectiveness of a group therapy intervention with treatment delivered through a sequence of cognitive behavioral therapy session blocks, called modules. An open-enrollment protocol permits entry of clients at the beginning of any new module in a manner that may produce unique MM sequences across clients. We begin with a model that composes an addition of client and multiple membership module random effect terms, which are assumed independent. Our MM DDP model relaxes the assumption of conditionally independent client and module random effects by specifying a collection of random distributions for the client effect parameters that are indexed by the unique set of module attendances. We demonstrate how this construction facilitates examining heterogeneity in the relative effectiveness of group therapy modules over repeated measurement occasions.","inCitations":["45dd90576b48e9ad77aae4f59e4482cb72109aae","7f673d188c8cb322fc893d9ffbe92ed636541d63","ccd2960a4b190e8aec142da32b09ebed5b8eecae"],"title":"Bayesian Non-Parametric Hierarchical Modeling for Multiple Membership Data in Grouped Attendance Interventions.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS620"}

The mean squares are sample variances where some of the experimental units have been used in more than one sample. The motivation for such an extension comes from pharmacokinetics. The observations, taken at different time points from a set of animals, are blood drug concentrations. Some animals were sampled at more than one time point. A linear combination of sample means provides an estimate of the population mean area under the concentration-versus-time curve, which is an indicator of drug exposure. An associated linear combination of sample variances provides an estimate of the variance of the area estimator. The behavior of confidence intervals based on the approximation was studied by simulation. The confidence interval for the population mean, constructed by assuming that the variance estimator has a chi-square distribution with the computed degrees of freedom, achieved close to its nominal 95% coverage, justifying the extension of Satterthwaite's approximation.","inCitations":["9f7571afba4b2957f11d5e2f4a4874a31481161a","990db49b57920c8018a2ce96932f2bb4ee53b980","79b9d2e546009606e1cf5d4a233c3f92d3c5beb2","d86d68fd62736fc48c759ddd22e430b898b24db4","31ef2296dd44e1d07f1b839f1903dfe14c72add1","b0ba2f179b31b3d92101a3e41055be8a3c3f957f","c8f49dc58f99b3731acbdc7c5cd747b41b216075","6bfe8acbc57a732e795a66e5b0dadbd09f5d7070","9cee8a44a99610816872db76197382822bb93cd3","5ca64f1c26733fe04d68987c93eee465cc5021b0","29be40f36fe5e3aee597b2a1be3671aa9043a8cb","09b61e23d105657ff7dd951478ad2f4e619e63c0","a597fd67e49101bbc2b88594d938bda0440d3b32","51e6fc04c9acd018429a1619628f7ba5261f4994","e2978044a6924beafd3c8551c3007b09e7ab81e9","e3deb8a7b2f53028ca3d9a1eb672c4d3b7ef48fe","cc19eabba9f98bfe66951c86dbf06917be757e67","27111ddf4e38b066c844f38c800aa410ef77bd0e","3c89808b46fa0bd8efb7fb0c6407051e806061eb","61517269090f88dd0c6a729317e88bdd6cb72d5d","e187fc62c4520230dd09a1b02dd47759fe55a657"],"title":"An extension of Satterthwaite's approximation applied to pharmacokinetics.","doi":"10.1080/10543409808835241"}

In this paper we study optimal designs for such studies, based on minimizing the total number of patients required to achieve a given level of power. A common approach when designing studies to compare several treatments with a control is to achieve the desired power for each individual pairwise treatment comparison. However, it is often more appropriate to characterize power in terms of the family of null hypotheses being tested, and to control the probability of rejecting all, or alternatively any, of these individual hypotheses. While all approaches lead to unbalanced designs with more patients allocated to the control arm, it is found that the optimal design and required number of patients can vary substantially depending on the chosen characterization of power. The methods make allowance for both continuous and binary outcomes and are illustrated with reference to two clinical trials, one involving multiple doses compared to placebo and the other involving combination therapy compared to mono-therapies. In one example a 55% reduction in sample size is achieved through an optimal design combined with the appropriate characterization of power.","inCitations":["0c6a623e7ecaac029b4aa534da2ceaf8191e4b0c","a64d5954a0336a722890731bf515601966b24b32","95169360ef1df9dc606190e4b8c8fa0836d24c93","3771e23f1fc85ebbc326607523010dfb924ae022","23501b65ddeee56bc9c7601e7996e5d6e9d1ee10","97b1a3e750de302ddd9e226b7e7769d16dcf219d","9db20ffcfa9e9cf65a6b951f1130c112f54902a1","309257fe4b3f37ec8889bbdaa532566c2fd9c43a","f969a823abec2ff130140a295d9a8bbfa35d9b42","9a4d5afa0422b166714cc25b39d6bf6ee8c69122"],"title":"Optimal design of clinical trials comparing several treatments with a control.","doi":"10.1002/pst.240"}

The objective of an new drug application (NDA) stability study is to collect and evaluate the evidence in support of the sponsor-proposed shelf life. The proposed shelf life is supported when each batch of the drug products in the study has shelf life no shorter than the proposed shelf life. When the value of the batch mean changes linearly, sometimes batches of the same product may share the same slope or regression line. In practice, batches are pooled to have a common estimate of slope or regression line when there is no significant difference in slope or regression line. Such practice is often applied in pooling across levels of a design factor such as package or strength in a stability study designed with multiple factors. However, falsely pooling different slopes or intercepts may increase false positive rates on the decision of approval for the proposed shelf life. The proposed algorithm used with the simulation technique tries to reduce false pooling rates for testing slope or intercept differences in order to bring down the false positive rates on the decision of approval for the proposed shelf life to the prespecified Type-I error rate of 5 or 10%.","inCitations":["139b929f0ab5aeb9ca4a8cbefa90f5fb5df231ac","d2c8143578d1601465e4127c65033d188ca1decc"],"title":"Significance levels for stability pooling test: a simulation study.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120022760"}

Typically, vaccine efficacy for infectiousness is estimated based on contrasts between the transmission risk to susceptible individuals from infected vaccinated individuals compared with that from infected unvaccinated individuals. Such estimates are problematic, however, because they are subject to selection bias and do not have a causal interpretation. Here, we develop causal estimands for vaccine efficacy for infectiousness for four different scenarios of populations of transmission units of size two. These causal estimands incorporate both principal stratification, based on the joint potential infection outcomes under vaccine and control, and interference between individuals within transmission units. In the most general scenario, both individuals can be exposed to infection outside the transmission unit and both can be assigned either vaccine or control. The three other scenarios are special cases of the general scenario where only one individual is exposed outside the transmission unit or can be assigned vaccine. The causal estimands for vaccine efficacy for infectiousness are well defined only within certain principal strata and, in general, are identifiable only with strong unverifiable assumptions. Nonetheless, the observed data do provide some information, and we derive large sample bounds on the causal vaccine efficacy for infectiousness estimands. An example of the type of data observed in a study to estimate vaccine efficacy for infectiousness is analyzed in the causal inference framework we developed.","inCitations":["42b92096f92e04fbde8d1b324fae22c38396f2dd","7bbbf9658e9bdb87efe55e2776271357d6c9a2cb","46fe0942f7eedf4b3dccbbee7f977c589fff22eb","c0f64796bd9e81588dc5f687662f61b0a8bd517a","f9377450f07844a55062337b3d431c7fd1065f39","b13ca22164620729ade497a756b248ab1678ec85","aa3a5a8b8af878ba14d010ade9ef86b9d474f6b5","edd3b613b436c4232e8513a4821d5d9077eaeb95","b056fa61b4888afd0079dc46898488b330f92ca9","71da4e69cc2e29cde587f6b76e9b66796abc3990","6bcc3f24f35e39908b34fd447ee968f9de75a01f","b3c8391e8e031eb01ed7b85a7187bf0aa1986660","96b988f31a866d0f8880929485440bac9cfd96ac","859f60ed6f52ce25b5fdf73cc603595d1bf135ad","108f2334a2c9501940abc0a35353db644b6f6ae7","0b739563ef933ba1f0efbf5c9c946d9a303880f3"],"title":"Causal Inference for Vaccine Effects on Infectiousness","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1354"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"As women approach menopause, the patterns of their menstrual cycle lengths change. To study these changes, we need to jointly model both the mean and variability of cycle length. Our proposed model incorporates separate mean and variance change points for each woman and a hierarchical model to link them together, along with regression components to include predictors of menopausal onset such as age at menarche and parity. Additional complexity arises from the fact that the calendar data have substantial missingness due to hormone use, surgery, and failure to report. We integrate multiple imputation and time-to event modeling in a Bayesian estimation framework to deal with different forms of the missingness. Posterior predictive model checks are applied to evaluate the model fit. Our method successfully models patterns of women's menstrual cycle trajectories throughout their late reproductive life and identifies change points for mean and variability of segment length, providing insight into the menopausal process. More generally, our model points the way toward increasing use of joint mean-variance models to predict health outcomes and better understand disease processes.","inCitations":["a50b503c82897700428582909cbbb7ad50245450","95e9210180a4567aac9141c16b9aeb050bab9ebd","78f405fc543d6746f409efc8c5e55b4bb4d3d3c1","3a49a9e0fa1733d25587abeff1e10cdb43457020","a9de76fdd0e31a3116965fd5f83e14aa1840f99a"],"title":"Modeling Menstrual Cycle Length and Variability at the Approach of Menopause Using Hierarchical Change Point Models.","doi":"10.1111/rssc.12044"}

Therefore, the identification of spatial scales associated with health effects can inform on pollution sources responsible for these effects, resulting in more targeted regulatory policy. Recently, prediction methods that yield high-resolution spatial estimates of PM2.5 exposures allow one to evaluate such scale-specific associations. We propose a two-dimensional wavelet decomposition that alleviates restrictive assumptions required for standard wavelet decompositions. Using this method we decompose daily surfaces of PM2.5 to identify which scales of pollution are most associated with adverse health outcomes. A key feature of the approach is that it can remove the purely temporal component of variability in PM2.5 levels and calculate effect estimates derived solely from spatial contrasts. This eliminates the potential for unmeasured confounding of the exposure - outcome associations by temporal factors, such as season. We apply our method to a study of birth weights in Massachusetts, U.S.A from 2003-2008 and find that both local and urban sources of pollution are strongly negatively associated with birth weight. Results also suggest that failure to eliminate temporal confounding in previous analyses attenuated the overall effect estimate towards zero, with the effect estimate growing in magnitude once this source of variability is removed.","inCitations":["57b0dbab116f82ea8d6461c387c8caf779deb4b1","2a43c540f5afba398e1c3cda4506cdae506ef522","41af2f2f80baa4c41ef3a31013d59b5711ba366f"],"title":"Spatial Multiresolution Analysis of the Effect of PM2.5 on Birth Weights.","doi":"10.1214/16-AOAS1018"}
