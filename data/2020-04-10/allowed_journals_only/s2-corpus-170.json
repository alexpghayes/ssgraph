This article provides a high-level, nontechnical summary of key statistical issues in the analysis of subgroups, with a focus on the regulatory context in which drug development and licensing decisions are made. References to specific aspects of regulatory processes are based on the system in Europe, though it is hoped that the principles outlined can be generally applied to other regulatory regions. This article challenges the common assumption that a clinical trial population should be assumed to be homogeneous, with homogeneous response to treatment, and asks whether commonly employed strategies for handling and identifying potential heterogeneity are sufficient. Investigations into subgroups are unavoidable, yet subgroup analyses suffer from fundamental complications and limitations of which those planning and interpreting clinical trials must be aware. Some areas for further methodological work and an improved methodological framework for the conduct of exploratory subgroup analyses are discussed. Above all, the need for an integrated scientific approach is highlighted.","inCitations":["bb109d02a1f19e312acac860950c7fff5f2b1759","484b65a1c3668403153153f3ec8e56a11e31e600","2822cd4f41962615b1ae6e1a8480a3c4afe1b33f","16194c938c76d5b3bd2a1715fa6e8f64b13e4e54","ce9faac7662a38b6871717c268cb14973b8fc398","3e40507b213275f501adda4778cdfab9f4b94786"],"title":"An overview of statistical and regulatory issues in the planning, analysis, and interpretation of subgroup analyses in confirmatory clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.856747"}

In some medical studies, however, an alternate approach has been taken: Declare the occurrence of an \"event\" when the sequence of measurements crosses a prespecified threshold, and compare the groups with respect to time to event using the log-rank test. This approach is appealing to clinicians, but clearly involves a loss of information and therefore statistical efficiency. The aim of this article is to quantify the degree of power loss in the context of the random line model. We also compare the summary measures approach to the random line approach. In regard to the efficiency loss with the survival analysis approach, we find that the loss ranges, depending on the location of the threshold, from moderate to dramatic. Using an optimally weighted log-rank test in place of the standard log-rank test leads to minimal gain in efficiency. In regard to analysis based on the original continuous measurements, for testing the slope a weighted summary measure appears to be the best overall choice, whereas for testing the intercept the maximum likelihood (ML) approach is typically much more efficient than the summary measures approach, although the efficiency of the ML approach can be compromised in studies with a small number of observation timepoints. These results have obvious implications for the choice of study design and analysis.","inCitations":["d26bed4e4c75f060534cdca3ae8cc84c6f0a8f25","d2dd47b643ab90d3b4d845839fecac10588a9438"],"title":"Power comparison of summary measure, mixed model, and survival analysis methods for analysis of repeated-measures trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2010.550702"}

Since then, a number of studies have made use of it. However, none of these has fully utilized all of the data nor have they developed a methodology in which it is possible to estimate models of the number of recurrences and durations that are consistent with each other. The purpose of this research is to determine which, if any, of the two drugs used in the trial, pyridoxine and theotepa, were effective and, by example, illustrate procedures that could be useful in the analysis of other clinical trial data sets. First, the number of recurrences is modeled as a count using the Poisson and negative binomial distributions with covariates. Then Poisson models are tested on the durations. Finally, durations and tumor counts per recurrence are fitted to more general autoregressive Wiebull and negative binomial distributions, respectively. Poisson models for durations are rejected in favor of the more general autoregressive models. The data on durations and tumor counts are shown to be more reliable from an inference point of view than the data on the number of recurrences. The data on durations and tumor counts show quite conclusively that both drugs are effective in treating bladder cancer, a result that differs from what others have found.","inCitations":["64ac4a0bd8b28252b1d557f6ed824e41c3aa4a6e"],"title":"Analyzing counts, durations, and recurrences in clinical trials.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100104198"}

Later work (Maity, et al., 2009) involved the possibility of modeling the environmental variable nonparametrically, but they focused on whether there was a parametric main effect for the genetic variables. In this paper, we consider the complementary problem, where the interest is in testing for the main effect of the nonparametrically modeled environmental variable. We derive a generalized likelihood ratio test for this hypothesis, show how to implement it, and provide evidence that our method can improve statistical power when compared to standard partially linear models with main effects only.

Thought disorder is considered as a putative schizophrenia endophenotype. Forty sets of genetic parameter values that correspond to the known prevalence values for thought disorder in schizophrenic patients, siblings of schizophrenics and the general population are evaluated. For these genetic parameter values, numerical results show that the test statistic has>70% power (α = 0.0001) in general with a sample of 200 or more proband-sibling pairs to detect the linkage between a marker (θ = 0.01), and a locus pleiotropic for schizophrenia and thought disorder.","inCitations":["d262f6b891b75a94c2843cbf1223d54519db60a6","aae39b7c5cd8b762e11ba5bc7730e7227ec4c7d0","6054d1906873dea705eb00f4c933e3361c1162b8","d9b35aebd5283ae41ee60538907701c5e1ca40ce","46e12771d05a1ec9f7274b88794bd7c4524c1f07","9339111f4c1f4df1230d7e866e7df9b1d05dd02c"],"title":"The power of linkage analysis of a disease-related endophenotype using asymmetrically ascertained sib pairs","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2008.08.030"}

The first approach models the binary longitudinal crash/near crash outcome using a binary latent variable which depends on risky driving covariates and previous outcomes. A random effects model introduces heterogeneity among subjects in modeling the mean value of the latent state.

However, the recovery of such a decomposition remains very challenging, largely due to the simultaneous presence of orthogonality constraints and co-sparsity regularization. By delving into the underlying statistical data generation mechanism, we reformulate the problem as a supervised co-sparse factor analysis, and develop an efficient computational procedure, named sequential factor extraction via co-sparse unit-rank estimation (SeCURE), that completely bypasses the orthogonality requirements. At each step, the problem reduces to a sparse multivariate regression with a unit-rank constraint. Nicely, each sequentially extracted sparse and unit-rank coefficient matrix automatically leads to co-sparsity in its pair of singular vectors. Each latent factor is thus a sparse linear combination of the predictors and may influence only a subset of responses. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge, and it ensures efficient computation even with incomplete data and/or when enforcing exact orthogonality is desired. Our estimators enjoy the oracle properties asymptotically; a non-asymptotic error bound further reveals some interesting finite-sample behaviors of the estimators. The efficacy of SeCURE is demonstrated by simulation studies and two applications in genetics.","inCitations":["c9136c55b78e4e45825c51913fc67e7c33f71758","27a1bd3ee1041343f62504792718f777e4e1bbb5","be9a75c1f417db890e3f19608705137d0352922f","a5ac3d2a9a80da8edacb0f1f1bf9eff3501fd446"],"title":"Sequential Co-Sparse Factor Regression.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2017.1340891"}

Because testing if the random effects are Gaussian is difficult, previous research has recommended using a flexible random effects density. However, computational limitations have precluded widespread use of flexible random effects densities for GLMMs and NLMMs. We develop a SAS macro, SNP_NLMM, that overcomes the computational challenges to fit GLMMs and NLMMs where the random effects are assumed to follow a smooth density that can be represented by the seminonparametric formulation proposed by Gallant and Nychka (1987). The macro is flexible enough to allow for any density of the response conditional on the random effects and any nonlinear mean trajectory.

The diagnostic accuracy of a medical test can be assessed by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the test. To summarize the ROC curve and determine an optimal cut-off point for test results, the Youden index is commonly used. In particular, the Youden index is optimized over the entire range of values for sensitivity and specificity, which determine the ROC space. However in clinical practice, one may only be interested in the regions of the ROC curve that correspond to low false-positive rates or/and high sensitivities. In this paper, a new summary index for the ROC curve, called the \"partial Youden index\", is defined on regions of the ROC space in which sensitivity/specificity values are of practical interest. The traditional Youden index is a special case of the partial Youden index. Various parametric and non-parametric interval estimation methods are proposed for the partial Youden index. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performances of the proposed methods. A real example is used to illustrate the application of the new methods.","inCitations":["946eae3babc3d9bfc68f490de4d63f5f611883d5","b697b03f0e6abc40db102b560b37098da9e86c83"],"title":"Partial Youden index and its inferences.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2018.1535502"}

However, the formulation of a latent variable model is often unknown a priori, the misspecification will distort the dependence structure and lead to unreliable model inference. Moreover, multiple outcomes with varying types present enormous analytical challenges. In this paper, we present a class of general latent variable models that can accommodate mixed types of outcomes. We propose a novel selection approach that simultaneously selects latent variables and estimates parameters. We show that the proposed estimator is consistent, asymptotically normal and has the oracle property. The practical utility of the methods is confirmed via simulations as well as an application to the analysis of the World Values Survey, a global research project that explores peoples' values and beliefs and the social and personal characteristics that might influence them.","inCitations":["8040836df8d06c90c517ad58ee935b3e71c0e0d2","c034b433dcb4923cca6357c6bcbca63e10d52f7f"],"title":"Selection of latent variables for multiple mixed-outcome models.","doi":"10.1111/sjos.12084"}

Blinded SSA is often preferred over unblinded SSA because it obviates many logistical complications of the latter and generally introduces less bias. On the other hand, current blinded SSA methods for binary data offer little to no new information about the treatment effect, ignore uncertainties associated with the population treatment proportions, and/or depend on enhanced randomization schemes that risk partial unblinding. I propose an innovative blinded SSA method for use when the primary analysis is a non-inferiority or superiority test regarding a risk difference. The method incorporates evidence about the treatment effect via the likelihood function of a mixture distribution. I compare the new method with an established one and with the fixed sample size study design, in terms of maximization of an expected utility function. The new method maximizes the expected utility better than do the comparators, under a range of assumptions. I illustrate the use of the proposed method with an example that incorporates a Bayesian hierarchical model. Lastly, I suggest topics for future study regarding the proposed methods.","inCitations":["b4afb207eaa2e014f78c7a2d01597185b27db673","5d6f84f2cb9c4a3cafbcf682b05219671a8321c5"],"title":"A Bayesian adaptive blinded sample size adjustment method for risk differences.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1708"}

In this article, the goal is to integrate multiple types of omics measurements, identify markers, and build a model for cancer outcome. The proposed analysis is achieved in two steps. In the first step, we analyze the regulation among different types of omics measurements, through the construction of linear regulatory modules (LRMs). The LRMs have sound biological basis, and their construction differs from the existing analyses by modeling the regulation of sets of gene expressions (GEs) by sets of regulators. The construction is realized with the assistance of regularized singular value decomposition. In the second step, the proposed cancer outcome model includes the regulated GEs, \"residuals\" of GEs, and \"residuals\" of regulators, and we use regularized estimation to select relevant markers. Simulation shows that the proposed method outperforms the alternatives with more accurate marker identification. We analyze the The Cancer Genome Atlas data on cutaneous melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma and obtain meaningful results.","inCitations":["9fb3193bb84ed26e9c6290e5468474b1d4beae31","ef9ab30667de75d9663b7ab94e7cdf7f18dcf69f","223e5f812dbbb97b9949ff6cc8d58aa01d531021","308bfcbf297646ae7636f84e80ce04e958fdc819","694d857e25323ce96535b90793b1bf459ad64e76","a14e5e2581814054769ece775662248f99cde29f","35aa0b2def3fee39b6b8e84eccba4021f8bfacac","386e1231cc2976c61842104289f92ca60881b239"],"title":"Integrating multidimensional omics data for cancer outcome.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw010"}

An integrated genomic profiling approach measuring multiple omics data types simultaneously in the same set of biological samples would render an integrated data resolution that would not be available with any single data type. In this study, we use penalized latent variable regression methods for joint modeling of multiple omics data types to identify common latent variables that can be used to cluster patient samples into biologically and clinically relevant disease subtypes. We consider lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005), and fused lasso (Tibshirani et al., 2005) methods to induce sparsity in the coefficient vectors, revealing important genomic features that have significant contributions to the latent variables. An iterative ridge regression is used to compute the sparse coefficient vectors. In model selection, a uniform design (Fang and Wang, 1994) is used to seek \"experimental\" points that scattered uniformly across the search domain for efficient sampling of tuning parameter combinations. We compared our method to sparse singular value decomposition (SVD) and penalized Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using both real and simulated data sets. The proposed method is applied to integrate genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data for subtype analysis in breast and lung cancer data sets.","inCitations":["73e90eb0ceb15441e761a2335e2cdffe3054c0af","95de1fa3f9c19ee800db44db901fb59b6695268f","33b2f25f27a11b76a7ab3ad3342acee0d0bdfb36","9fb3193bb84ed26e9c6290e5468474b1d4beae31","cba4fb40688c43d45f45f91d1800f37675e24ad0","e124d9685dc9c78882b8ec33b96a5f43fa8f3df0","e5aca0e3b65dfb207d609c45eeea5735344d3a57","1794c9b7ced485a8755db5b378653b773a00e52e","748766f258b98ce5b7351abc412dea7b6cf0e03a","0de1c1f30ed11f722d45d07e99f7ed7da42baa97","308bfcbf297646ae7636f84e80ce04e958fdc819","9a8b37bb9cd7fbc1ba8faa43b75bfd30dc9a999b","ce33cf5ec815d3d49aad42b1b84599cc38ad6578","a9c568d5884b6e525b522fd79fa5fc65168b4b64","bc5d0d9bf250a8573fb000f12b740a163fc3756f","308bd04c3b8c53962aa878fdfa9ba04aab61e786","84d854ff908ff0cb5e6349d79a3fe8004efd37b5","ff4690bf4279358b1a5b9ca87f7d87b5705c6565","0118739a50db9431e1bdffcda56e43400e1df9e2","16a0792b03d475b33c082e02b6e9b5620adad4c1","bfcc99290a90b5e40ca558657ae995e481e95b33","41825192562676c9564e920b8d26bf24acc7e44c","5558e2311138476cf6d5ad7be0125cabdc768120","e460ce35072b349a32c244b2053f273a7573a55f","8d3b65b5d2ba6fac0e7f0fef627cacca63e20307","7e9f4cab98d08ae624ace84dfc4638021240f237","c68ce2e060473397cc2dfaab52dafad934bc5dd8","848f002796146bae5ed5d73183031c0fa382e144","daaad6e3599399f118cf21420c834d1ff09787ea","2b6047629a1f88ef40f0c6c64052a4a6866b061f","373d2b126a8e4cf5f3e7bfb57b9fc9803a5661f8","301ac81c347ce2db9bb116d8b0d6be984e2589c0","5abfda7889e23547f539425da8a421d1126c5b54","3baa0a3a21904602e25225181f9ae94fb7a688d1","6dfd30f432d4f778cb9b8da3a6b12000e8672558","1df9134d61f16271cdd4537c446b2546d0c72a61","5403882bd4edec1194b3565293a0c1e7f1eefb03","096e5785b7a7265ccc7cea64790ffd9ab1d50798","e4cf9dc532e40fc3b76fd65f8e7e7679bac307ab","561b6892fcb41f9399072a362381e89baa26c53b","f22bcde65fe3529549b21191e865bb0e19b31445"],"title":"Sparse Integrative Clustering of Multiple Omics Data Sets.","doi":"10.1214/12-AOAS578"}

Although CMTs provide an array of powerful diagnostic tests for model checking, they were originally proposed in the econometrics literature and, to our knowledge, have never been applied to GEE analyses. CMTs cover many existing tests, including the (generalized) score test for an omitted covariate, as special cases.

It appears that 'quality' (whatever leads to more valid results) is of fairly high dimension and possibly non-additive and nonlinear, and that quality dimensions are highly application-specific and hard to measure from published information. Unfortunately, quality scores are often used to contrast, model, or modify meta-analysis results without regard to the aforementioned problems, as when used to directly modify weights or contributions of individual studies in an ad hoc manner. Even if quality would be captured in one dimension, use of quality scores in summarization weights would produce biased estimates of effect. Only if this bias were more than offset by variance reduction would such use be justified. From this perspective, quality weighting should be evaluated against formal bias-variance trade-off methods such as hierarchical (random-coefficient) meta-regression. Because it is unlikely that a low-dimensional appraisal will ever be adequate (especially over different applications), we argue that response-surface estimation based on quality items is preferable to quality weighting. Quality scores may be useful in the second stage of a hierarchical response-surface model, but only if the scores are reconstructed to maximize their correlation with bias.","inCitations":["e0fd9bc2eb645f5cb948904e5c5281772e7b6f7c","8e0ffb60db8fbcb549ed058e2a1b75d688917e9b","6cd98e5376cdfce983964bea91e7dca5603dff39","6a134bbf439b4ef3d5760677990bd09aa5d88700","37ad211697fb97f32fc72ea75649cc68187a513f","2fd76533e640fb9adb60ec2a98c0731dd4abc1ed","aad6159abd9865715009c3d47f9ed3c2a60e4d22","e4c565eb002107105ff081785430f0b1208037e6","6ee51267389f9931d4e41b94d4ca3cfce2e309f2","7a771b7bd9f6556a3ebffe39f945159aa46f4814","f1cf410b739b07091ac14c47efad8a40d229f72d","4581e3daba74bcfa3954d2d6f9df0a958154e06d","f9134fd432553cd9e93e4a10645fd0492ff8bd6a","c7c46eac492d2286868c422a922ebf510fd3a8d8","df8fbcdd6cbce08af691c66e1f14251386e3f78a","4806db0213194912f4f8578f4d68bc7eb7e32203","970498a8933482b67a7fb4bfdf42c1013beade75","96a454c3845ad0c418eb2f2e9578995e0cd27b9e","ee69ef331e51fbe25dcad9338f8a07e40ff1681f","0436d75e4500fdbecaa076e1249febcdf1cb77c6","18c5bab2b2bde463cfa8b9f694632f595bf2e166","41b9fa8093d44698ba8ad404037f167921d93d6a","2c4df64556d3210bb40e8d36e869d8210e23aa7d","c1062d445c41dc983d3c2318f768d8342d0c70f3","4025e067f1e877cf5f6fd607f28cdd73e62d6497","b42ce09c143962a6f09a55d172f4b8635a624fdd","22142c9cb17b4baab118767e497c93806d741461","5202f17b3a4e0dcfaf4ccfb84584df1d5d594b44","3a11f4f9d84f74bfb2d170d1aeeb27f232db2acf","984ba93d601745c11fbe71b118cda81bd5aec8c6","2a7a1647c00cd2335efb406b08b3b86b11f83826","918be94f53433340a3797f7b943aaafc0e79ff16","75b222746b8e268789b3e4cb57c497d41c894754","f65f3a0373b1b069d41f5dce864a7550cbaf0f2d","cf3486a9225cc0a6ff38280251a8097d88b9084e","5d54ae71f2d074992c77ba134d8b6e3cd1e91225","a66649c949f9c98bf650cf7190c080a6cbdd8c45","e4fbdf910ff10e567946de6cb118511493a2fd46","a016ca897af5d9243b137e0d997b8212fa1b0b0c","689500cddb8efe466453ec9e6c69d3930f03148e","25631b1d2281e4a29c551304e164dccf61994c0c","cb94be27d909f575ccc844941f9853c703407624","bcb6b31ae6e94169ad7362a0a314f8a137a8cc28","908a5be06dedf0c71dcdd5a4ead654b044fe2f86","927814a23642b1961b4cc5cf106e2e20c303f087","39fc7c759daf02eb4b8d733c0b88f86cdb04b9ca","f72a78ebbcd558963ebabd3155f3579d47be6e0b","a81e794c5fc7e7cbdac0a021576c2e2a3de7b493","fea30cc97a82b5347cb771bcf78af2ee1b2836f0","109dc071a47983d5883a8e3481345bb6c30e309e","a12178b838d7ee7e7757409e17739fa7e975dd97","61d4ff836c03ad3f744c5678445ef4aedca610a2","56e57f925e43039e796aa6deaddc8ef3943603df","6f991b9c0d93b3f46612cbd8c6850a33937b7098","ee2caea746289f226294141b43ad46eeaf197c2d","cfda94c1a1d5a116956d352b8e9498dc39f3944a","3a278fecfa7c6b9d1826fb5bca09ccd171d22dc2","57c3a51fc04f62a7be88ca21d8e19814c7d9dc03","d3fd2adfa91eb3ad0a68e773cd011971089be6f6","92bcefbfa09f2a4760314d5ef8c9ba61a5707d6b","b2ad92761299d2436bfc9f5d813010dd9779dd5e","9ebf194ee3652e42e9120082b026e4a06a85d12b","baf93715ab5b93a9274d4aa30c8661bab9fb74c9","298d4fd73c53d855c3d2e5b05b1210b128e3c93b","c3ca6a70decf56ec79fcaa5a5108272a2a6c8fda","83ee893fa22bd5baee8a27d17045f484d1e00d6a","4a28df18d89dcd5c64899a799c9375218885565d","5c791a5f9de1db59647b624e7c20a65a8dbe54d1","7148593d178cfd5f4304e122f1a79fa5cdb0864c","68987660deed4dffe2a9a7e37388e88464cf107d","6e05c6fa9fe75254b9ea274f183a771294178038","3c709b2fb1a53a8c7a0c5d3770032817c8896788","c97c4b1ba0ea178b6c222438eaf2d93fb3166703","a02d1d5971839b4ae80656e7b662ae48a7da1c7d","5eb95f7b1e0891fdfaa1bdc3967988f0688db828","6fb0a57dc37f6f7486a47bc42442599a0abb387b","6500b9d9ab60043822f2cc06e8313f109e9157e8","bc6c17b1b12785ff22f8b175cfb2d375dc6fe1d0","72f70730dbf3cf14a06d98ee6370d84fafa9d536","b21feb1dd0f63743acf6dfefb0d18d681cafb47d","89ab2022fe61120cc74927d5692472ef51a5ebf2","d49b059be444ac32e95a5e847177fb1c0681b39c","f0ba1c77532e464cd024709db00a93762f4d87fd","de5291c34369a2381ed5de1e3f4c36dbf98967e8","01382a7f5a417b61cc262be518106186033a5da8","bb3dd0b27b3342ca32a94911a23f367e55335f68","6b40ed20e834576c67f6ef9a17a4752a9e9a9225","76d1422ef73198bd58d04fa37b83d38cedeb527a","11e00bf837b75f618cc11907535064a9a15869bc","2bc543d4d2034c525dc02c66dd9c55cbce5ad63e","b131fbf081eaa4793dc04368b66c98da48ff67b6","81688d078dc578badcb81a7faf2f8bcdb8d0a897","874fb2e745cd30fa96273edac63de7a9f1476f28","853510cd640df2a5323e9f9f09a596b33cea1de7","ce349cc81f69a32803a0880b7e6cdbfee588c2ad","3361cff565ceffa2e250b93d7eec6b3f5a783184","82ac28fafd215a8d5bba79986d676bed04721fbe","6aa4eac435394412cae62d2c4931876a584b3419","51b486f8d5d2371e19c3283a37fecab044b2aae9","30b281e8463fa0d5355c193bca7a93f71429cdc9","febe2f6921ee6dab0459630d47e0e6cdbdad4e71","b42717775886e436d97964fca187c3248684112e","e80166e32b9c3a246437da4290966a35b1417fce","a8e2ad86a11e49ebb3afa4064b0a2722b6340fc0","a2164ffc1d3b2fd9053f6802bda7e90896fe1941","5fd060269e7a630e62041b44f1d35e376b54dbd0","61844f3393beb72e55561c911eb3cd96291fa0b3","8657a9a33d566a4e50dfa5b9a19ea3d4c6d49356","e7cad4024f2593e164b64b78d424794408120e31","a7d09c3ff605c5ad2929982a649b74813f34fd55","2ebd2eaf11965257ff83461b8aa1f5a422084092","bd881bb3f179a6fdb720ce65f4edc2f6d0387d9f","c34f8c8bffb35dcbedc2d7dd853fbedce7e68b3f","b95a10c2635dc5a5521f17f471a860abb0c8de9a","c498c7b3d9983b6ae917f6af5bedefcb434b77bb","bd45b79636db73178f3c180b715cb07c

We devise a hybrid Monte Carlo methodology to estimate parameters under 2 classes of latent structure, one arising due to the unobservable state identity of genes and the other due to the unknown set of covariates influencing the response within a state. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a simulation study and an application on an yeast cell-cycle data set.","inCitations":["6ab9bac818ddf8eb65d887fbf857171aca321644","f62c806b177696e005683693c4374c00ca1e9785","c5d1d8db72c9d9b4dbf856abab4a65eb6a2392c2","7f4f6b8d653f95da61699ea1c40104b272cad303","559059dad26a7dac630a4415a085996bd94c411a","05d43226195f3da60af88e6ae62770e8df1e1c41","d1ec0719768155be447fee16ffc797f3f8fead0d","f3c99bdc5499f78d51d6abfed6c3bb28456adc23","e829bff44e3a9ddf4584145d8c375ad887f3731c"],"title":"A temporal hidden Markov regression model for the analysis of gene regulatory networks.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm007"}

Due to cost considerations, self-reported outcomes are routinely collected in lieu of expensive diagnostic tests in large-scale prospective investigations such as the Women's Health Initiative. However, self-reported outcomes are subject to imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Using a semiparametric likelihood-based approach, we present time to event models to estimate the association of one or more covariates with a error-prone, self-reported outcome. We present simulation studies to assess the effect of error in self-reported outcomes with regard to bias in the estimation of the regression parameter of interest. We apply the proposed methods to prospective data from 152,830 women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative to evaluate the effect of statin use with the risk of incident diabetes mellitus among postmenopausal women. The current analysis is based on follow-up through 2010, with a median duration of follow-up of 12.1 years. The methods proposed in this paper are readily implemented using our freely available R software package icensmis, which is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website.","inCitations":["122f74476ef489d041199084ccc7a3ef004d0b90"],"title":"Semiparametric Time to Event Models in the Presence of Error-prone, Self-reported Outcomes-with Application to the Women's Health Initiative.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS810"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2008,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"Analytical method transfer is an important part of analytical method development and maintenance. The current common practice of analytical method transfer is based on the equivalence of the means between the original laboratory and the receiving laboratory. However, for some assays the most scientifically sound approach would be to show the equivalency of individual sample readings between the two laboratories. In this study, statistical approaches such as limit of agreement, total deviation index, and tolerance interval approach to address individual equivalence between laboratories are discussed. Using a tolerance interval approach that is equivalent to the two one-sided hypothesis testing is proposed. These approaches are compared with each other and also with the mean equivalence approach on their statistical properties. Examples are presented to illustrate each analysis approach and the comparisons.","inCitations":["ce1c54c0d7e82cade0662f48509815ce3146c03f","6503ade527603b304d60f747fdab34133cfbe92b"],"title":"Statistical assessment of analytical method transfer.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802287347"}

This procedure is based on exact conditional binomial distributions of number of events from the treated subjects conditional on total numbers of events at each interim analysis stage. We show that this procedure (vs. non interim analysis) can greatly reduce the trial length when the null hypothesis is false. We also discuss the impact of number of interim analyses, different alpha spending functions, and the discreetness of binomial distribution on the efficiency of this procedure. Corresponding Splus programs were also developed.","inCitations":["1f44fcbc7f3308a6ae6ec4d7d399937c369e82ac","1f6685af82d5054fd77e54d40fe2c031c8de8aa0","1cc439940abd79014db89ffed777bc79c29f2bf8","62d7e360454b2fd61460f8298cfc381452216bc0","56a82f24f9846492e2f6f227a17ea6a22a397fc7","1c4442e0251ff758a3f0e497a1e416fa85ebaf37","beb75b23e71072429b52d5233554b173a39c50ce"],"title":"A procedure for group sequential comparative poisson trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701514015"}

This paper describes novel uses of singular value decompositions (SVD) and weighted versions of them (WSVD) to extract the signals from such movies, in a way that is semi-automatic and tuned closely to the actual data and their many complexities. These complexities include the following. First, the images themselves are of no interest: all interest focuses on the behavior of individual cells across time, and thus, the cells need to be segmented in an automated manner. Second, the cells themselves have 100+ pixels, so that they form 100+ curves measured over time, so that data compression is required to extract the features of these curves. Third, some of the pixels in some of the cells are subject to image saturation due to bit depth limits, and this saturation needs to be accounted for if one is to normalize the images in a reasonably un-biased manner. Finally, the Ca(2+) signals have oscillations or waves that vary with time and these signals need to be extracted. Thus, our aim is to show how to use multiple weighted and standard singular value decompositions to detect, extract and clarify the Ca(2+) signals. Our signal extraction methods then lead to simple although finely focused statistical methods to compare Ca(2+) signals across experimental conditions.","inCitations":["e94e3bbc61bea17ef73285930585c2e007aea79a","04b5cf79297e67d2b40d906a0cfbe28aa7852eb0","ae77c30857e52fe8ec3ac01c39e5948eafbcadf8"],"title":"Use of multiple singular value decompositions to analyze complex intracellular calcium ion signals","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS253"}
