In this paper, we consider the problem of how the covariates affect the mean QAL when the data are subject to right censoring. We allow a very general form for the mean model as a function of covariates. Using the idea of inverse probability weighting, we first construct a simple weighted estimating equation for the parameters in our mean model. We then find the form of the most efficient estimating equation, which yields the most efficient estimator for the regression parameters. Since the most efficient estimator depends on the distribution of the health history processes, and thus cannot be estimated nonparametrically, we consider different approaches for improving the efficiency of the simple weighted estimating equation using observed data. The applicability of these methods is demonstrated by both simulation experiments and a data example from a breast cancer clinical trial study.","inCitations":["8711d6b82a745ef50e948c3acf60959b24e699bf","737bf97d5efb079c97a2b6a8e7f96d020f544fa3","03f903dc2bc892044784272011eb69d116be55b1","172218103594ee93e8b2a0f61506579e715ec3c5","972182572e265b32a4a6daeeb5035fe082957c8a"],"title":"Regression analysis of mean quality-adjusted lifetime with censored data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl016"}

Series C, Applied statistics","paperAbstract":"To assess the value of a continuous marker in predicting the risk of a disease, a graphical tool called the predictiveness curve has been proposed. It characterizes the marker's predictiveness, or capacity to risk stratify the population by displaying the distribution of risk endowed by the marker. Methods for making inference about the curve and for comparing curves in a general population have been developed. However, knowledge about a marker's performance in the general population only is not enough. Since a marker's effect on the risk model and its distribution can both differ across subpopulations, its predictiveness may vary when applied to different subpopulations. Moreover, information about the predictiveness of a marker conditional on baseline covariates is valuable for individual decision making about having the marker measured or not. Therefore, to fully realize the usefulness of a risk prediction marker, it is important to study its performance conditional on covariates. In this article, we propose semiparametric methods for estimating covariate-specific predictiveness curves for a continuous marker. Unmatched and matched case-control study designs are accommodated. We illustrate application of the methodology by evaluating serum creatinine as a predictor of risk of renal artery stenosis.","inCitations":["e7412758b2ea54732a98d08f2d9a48097692eb09","6cb52a446be852ad148e5518e380eefb71a61fe2","4d6873ebc715422e21de41570bbaad490a0a0e53","71dcb641dc68cb5b8ea44e349110385cbf2b24b2","db6ca44857ba0d9aba5c96b5f6cae65512ce2c0c","288d61766ac2f2fc4200176759bca56df9d14624","404ca6315a285f35c3bc6efefc69e866687072ba","76c3ae6b58f3c3504ef9f2327568d10cd6b64080"],"title":"Semiparametric methods for evaluating the covariate-specific predictiveness of continuous markers in matched case-control studies.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9876.2009.00707.x"}

It has been shown to work well in terms of having small mean-squared error in many examples (smaller than known competitors), as well as producing visually-appealing fits that are smooth (filtering out high-frequency noise) while adapting to sudden changes (retaining high-frequency signal). However, BARS is computationally intensive. The original implementation in S was too slow to be practical in certain situations, and was found to handle some data sets incorrectly. We have implemented BARS in C for the normal and Poisson cases, the latter being important in neurophysiological and other point-process applications. The C implementation includes all needed subroutines for fitting Poisson regression, manipulating B-splines (using code created by Bates and Venables), and finding starting values for Poisson regression (using code for density estimation created by Kooperberg). The code utilizes only freely-available external libraries (LAPACK and BLAS) and is otherwise self-contained. We have also provided wrappers so that BARS can be used easily within S or R.","inCitations":["ea9d7cc9d0e37b89e97bc9ec63fb9bc69f5836f4","a349f8fa173fe04e4c6e6615c16c1fe200422402","0af3783e9bf928fa258651a2746a49d58ec6e932","a6957beb9bcef62d3d29bf9dce0d2d250018a3ac","cda94fcf6af850c8eb4b090e00674411ff0891ab","d9dfd7f33332ba898197116f528a3547ba1f68bf","793bc24b5be86f648a116df6982a044bedaf4009","254565e144994434d7e01a4b2b01405c0874f303","42d8f792f785e53d7a93a9371bc6d0db00a27175","e4b057391f12b93f086c927f4d4593bb8657eaf2","896225d682d6389694618ba7f7f54b0fa4a301b1","0633ad8ab86e6e38c2d9a418bbed8da73982986c","67240a33c09692df0ab0c70e9d5883e737c6c809","ddeb3bfe2fd3986609ac25019cf0b34f9cd3edde","a2f65d1a7525242cbf49433eb4f47a3b4072f774","8ca94bd19dce8811db87a7eaabdb21f53cd8f5e1","99c688111ec96a302220a45c892eb92d2654dc80","ef75220a0784788969e19ffc30016d9b81ab2e3b","8946cbafa3e81ab16db22017377de3854b501c73","287cb0c69b015ba52ffa22e11b281b8f20a6cf44","0b8ca3426fe610cc056b644e2d23100d5a114d97","afad85d22b6a98934572d6da70c798421eb47c94","c8ed11367c3f82ca4250edd7e598831d4c552b19","ae1333e607e71bdb057e1861c8656efb9a58e6e7","afd876634398d67ad06e204d4460e674e8ad9b35","c83ee6b41512e273c66f5f58fee12c21a93d6d0a","d0000b216826257f6b1edb77bf8a10095ae2a280","090af02dea6f1bc41a64c7c318f5f10d5d2ee666","fc5aca9470e42a59d3d5f929f363ce589b66ed76","2b09cbac90fc692492789fdddfba120e6f0066b4","c1571c3cca81acb0be0576f670d133df81fa5b4c","ee30f2eb780842abc68d1e1e39070a2c8145ef33","782d4a1a2792d834cca23196709da30e11ca2077","b97f1b1f012031e63e30aa78ffea681b0607be53"],"title":"An Implementation of Bayesian Adaptive Regression Splines (BARS) in C with S and R Wrappers.","doi":"10.18637/jss.v026.i01"}

For diseases in which it is rare that a new compound is active, we argue that more stringent type I error rates in the phase II setting may be more important relative to relaxing the type II error rates. The paper itself is more of a 'thought' experiment on this topic such that specific clinical trial settings will require specific applications of this approach. This is due in part to the fact that the real-world setting is more complex relative to overall decision process in terms of moving from phase II to phase III trials than our basic illustrative model.","inCitations":["ecac3d2d742cdfffe01ba5f56dbc090d2fa6cf5f","1c8f1e5c8fe664df7abbd4bf2551cd729db6e2b3","e9dd3ff44f27c8b7b3663cf2a5da12530dc2e341"],"title":"An examination of the relative impact of type I and type II error rates in phase II drug screening trial queues.","doi":"10.1002/pst.529"}

In this paper, we consider stochastic extensions in order to capture unknown influences (changing behaviors, public interventions, seasonal effects, etc.). These models assign diffusion processes to the time-varying parameters, and our inferential procedure is based on a suitably adjusted adaptive particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The performance of the proposed computational methods is validated on simulated data and the adopted model is applied to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in England. In addition to estimating the effective contact rate trajectories, the methodology is applied in real time to provide evidence in related public health decisions. Diffusion-driven susceptible exposed infected retired-type models with age structure are also introduced.","inCitations":["f44d8a6cb85c35bfd5d45ada58c36d73ee8649d8","15fd0e68c59ff685cd56d26eb9c4bf5b6825f476","73e3da7ca029c2e1b10212ddf0fcaa3f8264543b","d39e1ad6f47b2edcfb3b8333b7469e849602ddd4","b8088985b489a73e6cd21a99c283a730b1d142e0","17d7eac7cb23cce8cb94bd9c16851f482b81b921","093516335e39916bc2ef1bd19160d0a4d728190b","ef5595c55ac5a8d7b81a77d280a8047426a91720","cfa032c8c5706ee81a2d3d6cd1cd0e2aa7da2f47","a94a95572e1a5518081736f1849b2bf77b94561f","5d08e2aa9c36d47f6d5f0c23faaa33ebf2768a12","1c00c27a78f6c82ee3da52b0652c239a656ee18e","2fc51c77e4a201f574eafbe8e27e74e4c6f86204","bc49ea1ab8e5436b471407d7489e4c4b6050f67e","66a25d4eca24e35549a8342cc30f77699e329f98","30e92ae8c36034421d79687eafe966ed904bd98a","64f1ce1b41f1592b047dbfe0803f4e03b1246595","da005463c7dee90049b9ecb318eac8d5b419d9e7","f5c3488f15c39da4dde6e92f5013e63ed360cba0","901909e042c1aea7f18514175a0edad12016d776","1b726b4442e6beb4817f2d0d0f7f8507178945ec","3b6a0db22ac5e46095e6d2b3427f549f3af0bfe9","55e6be44bfe72aa5ab260ac852b9dfcdcd02ccab","1c7fe621f47ade4d511af9cf543b83d2e91c68a8","fa4c0136b5f96f629bab51b569a3eb4f24b0db0f","951a56ce32a26ceeeeefe33e3f02c11b753fab33","a37b2ea4c4c80c0d032a9ee596caac1bfdeb6222","8aac85ad8b8eb5484615fc3ee8571cb51c60595e","34e6d6391b1623f87a4ac31e12de3b5db54b3f4e","d44a4feeea420d871222cb7a50b670be63fae1ae","9c7e7c52eb64e017b82dcc7743b565517539a527","a890ac56a8db0688b7708ba94c49217f4c7a91c1","5b994478490185bb0b7d5f4dda8b3af7327c0bd0","9d7cf63935101081c93ce4a8fb4d3628d9d689de","4f584cdab9db3832b3e584ec34f04bbe1cc9600c","8d7371d1ebe932d76038377366291b277b7ef4d5"],"title":"Capturing the time-varying drivers of an epidemic using stochastic dynamical systems.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs052"}

These methods are typically assessed via case-control samples, which include one cohort of cases known to have the disease and a second control cohort of disease-free subjects. Such studies give direct estimates of sensitivity and specificity but only indirect estimates of PPV and NPV, which also depend on the disease prevalence in the tested population. The motivating example arises in assay testing, where usage is contemplated in populations with known prevalences. Further instances include biomarker development, where subjects are selected from a population with known prevalence and assessment of PPV and NPV is crucial, and the assessment of diagnostic imaging procedures for rare diseases, where case-control studies may be the only feasible designs. We develop formulas for optimal allocation of the sample between the case and control cohorts and for computing sample size when the goal of the study is to prove that the test procedure exceeds pre-stated bounds for PPV and/or NPV. Surprisingly, the optimal sampling schemes for many purposes are highly unbalanced, even when information is desired on both PPV and NPV.","inCitations":["5ce296f45a3cb7360454017fa83f7e0ab4d56ed1","150cd120fd13944642f8b21badb90a5bcf150960","b50de6a6bd8181427f5ea39f45b9a02aceef1ba6","6f11da749496dbe6ca39232c6169e8c5c774b615","de45e142de21c6a73d0279e6be56d011a52b1cb9","4fdd9e7ead59ca1ba88624b2e2ac45d93de7caa6","6b5ed5cf4fc5f786f6bd6c999c1f0593f3f388c3","011fbd683e62faf578790a03cd70a236ab90b53d","0f1de935a31dc09edfe7a19c57e96246bf69a966","a726e4cbfcd92b6d8579f204ba34c6b70d26c735","596c4b9e0b7817120acb917cff4728fab9f95ca8","86918dc2b3297bb87ec34688044949bfbc030343","30c7d936622196ade6b7dfb8f2df4c56fc2b553d","9afeafb5739dfaea8db1ffac0552973187f949ba","878b654e645f9f612d2e14e7c18532424974122f","953452dae2d06e46edddfa5dd5a34970b43e5e63","0ddb3445ae9490f22ddf8d14fd737d8a20241c4e","875cf982434ed18d69133372cce88be7d0051892","3294ddca19550e279ed5d6a35678bd6f1f70de11","df5257733164042aea61860c2ab38c4e2b945cd3","04fc5d3a2f6b0ecf5369ccc3925073060cb5909e","2868e5697f76cb42b1069c04822f31c3601a50d2","4701d680e96accfa7d684dd8aecac2d03c98d65d","5025f150c640cab1603a5930d946fdce21885b2d","ce2ea7cf729a77e426d21cac7c52a6512297d34e"],"title":"Sample size for positive and negative predictive value in diagnostic research using case-control designs.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxn018"}

Latent class analysis attempts data reduction by classifying subjects into one of K unobserved classes based on observed data. Latent class models have recently been extended to accommodate longitudinally observed data. We extend these approaches in a Bayesian framework to accommodate trajectories of both continuous and discrete data. We consider whether latent class models might be used to distinguish patients on the basis of trajectories of observed affect scores, reported events, and presence or absence of clinical depression.","inCitations":["cd7ec2430b39394e9239abcf8e9304f75862a4a4","ecd696e0a2abccd256478fc766c2dbbce118a398","b752bab67777d7758fd648e0028dbecccc38998b","355c3560d1a5c645f61a6cb767fe47e531536ec2","b2a7429252b88b677696cbd1a83387a44e47ea66","78dd65bc9703b68c66742aa8b81f420932acf510","514ff91ea4ceb194d6711c2d48679130f62c9434","209e7c4743258710ef6e9537f1ce8eb7b7091b2f","b18cfb239d74cf262bacd4d0ced1e1f600725a2a","80fbf5eed674bad7af0051d4d2d5086d465add27","4b6f06457fc9df3789bec0d8e4c66e01bd7f69f0","3190ae595fe69ca483bb743e1d015214fc24c37c","249fd826d3902a4cd095bcc9a7a56828c1b98b94","cc48db29577506e0e004f346e214d05a3e3a127c","6e968a198ecf07c36d6aa37839d4555263637f8b","d79e1ecc3b689c443568d30ee439291740572785","25bf5f4a8a9defbe16ae721189058e0562ea4dbe","690c9caed207b1ad083125d4ee177a2d7fa6edd7","33525fd50b9bfbafbe6101eaa158725e850112e1","588d15aa4af8099e73d176c2cef8ef903b01e14d","b622dfffdb15dd62a1be44dc001829a6cdcf0681","b4228783ffdb1a18a0c89cad4ca80141d175ff6f","047b09af534cca308e2acdd02c0346759e1a2997","9aaf9bd34a3186e96ec52377b3e8ca9e86caed99","65c6ac7dcab2ef199688c53f9d5416e7a216792d","f97c54972314dd70a30c679d24916ed2e51a9f7e","d36ca3e9dca36e242c7ba19caffe16047cb353d3","febc204104962b40f14a554ff68f2445018a31de","1e6139174ec543ab22a2bb274eb1c8b19cb74848","9f599b589c2baf129f21303c219e9e6e1eb8b9b6","dffa462e23bd37e1a61b8c09751164dddaacf931","af9389f237d694350b79315b1400561940af0a3a","2b4c4836f89ed4bde4cb19737a0bc38c72facc93","5cc396f458a749b3104130f39d43b0fc951a32cd","b1cad5f777c44c41672dc5266c1735de012ad11c","27b020178ac395947eefc70e50f1a5f0fbc8ffd1","357f5e270322de2c75505a9f3b47e9cfc43d8706","98a729501c2aa9f846cdf978633499dfba6673c5","60b3b66b0a7976aa3b91bc99669c3308ae8ddcad","362d20aca67c9b1472fe4794344ce174e058397b","faf70947c948d80fc68e817a9d0a2f926b232a75","ab365b954659b53aaa6a7ca6c07165501678fda6"],"title":"Using a Bayesian latent growth curve model to identify trajectories of positive affect and negative events following myocardial infarction.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxh022"}
