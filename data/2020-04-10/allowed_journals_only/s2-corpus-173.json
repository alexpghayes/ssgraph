Adding an action-research intervention component to a regular summer job program for youth was expected to help in preventing risk behaviors. A series of simple two-group alternative structural equation models are compared to test the effect of the intervention on one key attitudinal outcome in terms of model fit and statistical power with Monte Carlo simulations. Some models presuming parameters equal across the intervention and comparison groups were underpowered to detect the intervention effect, yet modeling the unreliability of the outcome measure increased their statistical power and helped in the detection of the hypothesized effect. Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) could benefit from flexible multi-group alternative structural models organized in decision trees, and modeling unreliability of measures can be of tremendous help for both the fit of statistical models to the data and their statistical power.","inCitations":["1c05e8c6afee456c73d3617b623e18ff95dc1ea8","bc2e4c80396123d76ebf306fa752ae9180f8c102","fa2b0309498961b92ffb53063e1baad4b40bded7"],"title":"Statistical Power of Alternative Structural Models for Comparative Effectiveness Research: Advantages of Modeling Unreliability.","doi":"10.22237/jmasm/1398917100"}

This problem can arise in several different situations in both case-control studies and clinical trials. For efficient estimation we appeal to the method of generalized least squares to estimate the summary effect and its standard error. This method requires estimates of the covariances between those contrasts that are not independent. Although it is not possible to estimate the covariance between effects that have been adjusted for confounding factors we present a method for finding upper and lower bounds for this covariance. In the simplest discussion homogeneity of the relative risks is assumed but the method is then extended to allow for heterogeneity in an overall estimate. We then illustrate the method with several examples from an analysis in which case-control studies of cervical cancer and oral contraceptive use are synthesized.","inCitations":["7301519f8b1c31a655109e4f5b1496830084ebdb","6d42569a9838eb4ecccb33150c53c57279217d39","3850f69122890f119599b73b522375f9ffcac095","27ae07507e0dbcf40e8ecaedaffe0c3fec670da9","fcf7baf95215565efe5d32d37c2e95d0318c60a5","72b9fd5523f36bc14749d71ec089d563df63228e","25500412efdff2e83b5a0f455f6e0f16c9eb9585","e8be6f3623cd62a5d22ff984eca79b626b960dde","9515db556428bea985450c2efa6aa6f06d0af6d8","a41ddf8913fd60d6d81a94d1bd3304c421f53cda","7f5c5a00a57c8d8a6b6bb1d8029fe3c465af3df1","fcf5b1cb8f1f88cb6e0601b05109e971d5be83b4","6f4d40b36e25e9b5978097718c928c94309283a0","e53acb64c2d891081805d04f9c82a709ac453993","8fd3c2b8b3d5aa02f697433e42667d0163672048","453ecd87f83a2907032a17851569364146328872","d391876cf44e9e269fa55b788b8008b44de2ed54","bb219ae60f396dcb6a5135f078bc5d6965f042b9","1bb17e268c71ae535f9bb7a0cc4cf034f39e0a56","88058f99531a043317b2fc67d7354f1615e6b97e","0514b0013bb1949dac600bc0754e463489ef0729","f7c86a047a876e8485499f50addd6645e3fc0cad","b50b93fe9d4a593ff631d2fb5628084f38d23a8e","20c4d6daadfb242a13983210850248a09bda0738","3630420ac30df68d1ac34951d2caf21d9cca4dc6","40d040519a70269f857a52da90bbc48f325a26e7"],"title":"Generalized least squares for the synthesis of correlated information.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.3.423"}

One potential problem with such an approach is that the conditionally specified models may be incompatible, which can lead to serious problems in applications. We propose an odds ratio representation of a joint density to study the issue and derive conditions under which conditionally specified distributions are compatible and yield a joint distribution. Our conditions are the simplest to verify compared with those proposed in the literature. The proposal also explicitly construct joint densities that are fully compatible with the conditionally specified densities when the conditional densities are compatible, and partially compatible with the conditional densities when they are incompatible. The construction result is then applied to checking the compatibility of the conditionally specified models. Ways to modify the conditionally specified models based on the construction of the joint models are also discussed when the conditionally specified models are incompatible.","inCitations":["267e4f0cec27c1a57e2a53ec7aac53efac67b2e4","3f7f9c029a40740e9e8615dedfca5e808df2b759","12d63cbc4041440ffaec690515fb9a5febc40956","a6767bfe3c1fdb20c9cdb39dfdca081f0b153ec0","b31edc6aa167a443417bcb5f587f65767d789b16","e7c72ec170696b75afe94299dd808ecd2254da6a","254b409d30715f7eb6e951c09ac6630f13e0e38e","4ea7f50bd6f336a791e0c588ce08f6ee86681339","26556e28f14bd6a4adcfaf1bda7dfdf08b3ff46f","66e27dd410e1d47cfe12f983d734f70e9206a7e7","8ede971f536a473b79c7d59973e52cffba513044","73bfdbd756b29cbba5c5c3de716b3a59dbc7b8ff","7b278b954288e3780d2926d6e7729efd9c86c9b4","e9b17ced7ca194702a835263c89a03e5b6892729","7509831d87cd17a05a5e1d23c1f873a404bd8724","0041d9bf36ff681c0d369fddb6f8847b428ee326","346830728b6bd0e4b36e4eea1931b2b616ff2928"],"title":"Compatibility of conditionally specified models.","doi":"10.1016/j.spl.2009.12.025"}

The general strategy is to fit a robust regression line, or some type of smoother that allows curvature, and then use a robust analogue of explanatory power, say eta(2). When the regression surface is a plane, an estimate of eta(2) via the Theil-Sen estimator is found to perform well, relative to some other robust regression estimators, in terms of mean squared error and bias. When there is curvature, a generalization of a kernel estimator derived by Fan performs relatively well, but two alternative smoothers have certain practical advantages. When eta(2) is approximately equal to zero, estimation using smoothers has relatively high bias. A variation of eta(2) is suggested for dealing with this problem. Methods for testing H(0): eta(2)=0 are examined that are based in part on smoothers. Two methods are found that control Type I error probabilities reasonably well in simulations. Software for applying the more successful methods is provided.","inCitations":["7bb66f838bbcf5359b50b262c6298f95e25902e1","dfcaeb022d6eab17a795362a93d69a672989aefb","7cdc0d161621a2549eee2d696932c76ccbd5bf26","031fa5e13663704bb40d11ed13a00dd6b13f27d9"],"title":"Measuring and detecting associations: methods based on robust regression estimators or smoothers that allow curvature.","doi":"10.1348/000711009X467618"}

When continuous (longitudinal) responses follow a distribution that is quite different from a normal distribution, usual mean regression (MR)-based linear models may fail to produce efficient estimators, whereas QR-based linear models may perform satisfactorily. To the best of our knowledge, there have been very few studies on QR-based nonlinear models for longitudinal data in comparison to MR-based nonlinear models. In this article, we study QR-based nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) joint models for longitudinal data with non-central location and outliers and/or heavy tails in response, and non-normality and measurement errors in covariate under Bayesian framework. The proposed QR-based modeling method is compared with an MR-based one by an AIDS clinical dataset and through simulation studies. The proposed QR joint modeling approach can be not only applied to AIDS clinical studies, but also may have general applications in other fields as long as relevant technical specifications are met.","inCitations":["e1b448181feecef0e4120cc9351ab9d48ca34375","e2367f02b528899ef1aeebaf8e2e23b44fd75cab"],"title":"Bayesian quantile regression for nonlinear mixed-effects joint models for longitudinal data in the presence of mismeasured covariate errors.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2016.1269781"}

These developments have impacted all areas of applied and theoretical statistics and have allowed data analysts to avoid the biases incurred under the pervasive practice of parametric model misspecification. In this commentary, I discuss issues around the use of data-adaptive regression in estimation of causal inference parameters. To ground ideas, I focus on two estimation approaches with roots in semi-parametric estimation theory: targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE; van der Laan and Rubin, 2006) and double/debiased machine learning (DML; Chernozhukov and others, 2018). This commentary is not comprehensive, the literature on these topics is rich, and there are many subtleties and developments which I do not address. These two frameworks represent only a small fraction of an increasingly large number of methods for causal inference using machine learning. To my knowledge, they are the only methods grounded in statistical semi-parametric theory that also allow unrestricted use of data-adaptive regression techniques.","inCitations":["90046fc579e40b2a51a4221f4480701ecc4e5f2d"],"title":"Machine learning in the estimation of causal effects: targeted minimum loss-based estimation and double/debiased machine learning.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxz042"}

Imprecise definitions can be a source of controversies about appropriate statistical methods, interpretation of results, and extrapolations to larger populations. This paper presents precise definitions of some familiar terms and definitions of some new terms, some perhaps controversial. The glossary contains definitions that can be copied into a protocol, statistical analysis plan, or similar document and customized. The definitions were motivated and illustrated in the context of a longitudinal RCCT in which some randomized enrollees are non-adherent, receive a corrupted treatment, or withdraw prematurely. The definitions can be adapted for use in a much wider set of RCCTs. New terms can be used in place of controversial terms, for example, subject. We define terms specifying a person's progress through RCCT phases and that precisely define the RCCT's phases and milestones. We define terms that distinguish between subsets of an RCCT's enrollees and a much larger patient population. 'The intention-to-treat (ITT) principle' has multiple interpretations that can be distilled to the definitions of the 'ITT analysis set of randomized enrollees'. Most differences among interpretations of 'the' ITT principle stem from an RCCT's primary objective (mainly efficacy versus effectiveness). Four different 'authoritative' definitions of ITT analysis set of randomized enrollees illustrate the variety of interpretations. We propose a separate specification of the analysis set of data that will be used in a specific analysis.

Such statistical practices may lead to incorrect conclusions about treatment effects or clinical trial designs that are impractical or that do not accurately reflect the investigator's goals. Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models and methods are a very flexible new class of statistical tools that can overcome such limitations. This is because BNP models can accurately approximate any distribution or function and can accommodate a broad range of statistical problems, including density estimation, regression, survival analysis, graphical modeling, neural networks, classification, clustering, population models, forecasting and prediction, spatiotemporal models, and causal inference. This paper describes 3 illustrative applications of BNP methods, including a randomized clinical trial to compare treatments for intraoperative air leaks after pulmonary resection, estimating survival time with different multi-stage chemotherapy regimes for acute leukemia, and evaluating joint effects of targeted treatment and an intermediate biological outcome on progression-free survival time in prostate cancer.","inCitations":["fd32fd97ef629c23e69489c227cb4a6e9c0d5aa6"],"title":"Bayesian nonparametric statistics: A new toolkit for discovery in cancer research.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1819"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Medicine"],"year":2010,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Biostatistics","paperAbstract":"Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) is the most widely used preprocessing algorithm for Affymetrix and Nimblegen gene expression microarrays. RMA performs background correction, normalization, and summarization in a modular way. The last 2 steps require multiple arrays to be analyzed simultaneously. The ability to borrow information across samples provides RMA various advantages. For example, the summarization step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe effects, assumed to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. Residuals, obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality metrics. However, the dependence on multiple arrays has 2 drawbacks: (1) RMA cannot be used in clinical settings where samples must be processed individually or in small batches and (2) data sets preprocessed separately are not comparable. We propose a preprocessing algorithm, frozen RMA (fRMA), which allows one to analyze microarrays individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis. This is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly available microarray databases. In particular, estimates of probe-specific effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. Then, with new data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new arrays to normalize and summarize the data. We find that fRMA is comparable to RMA when the data are analyzed as a single batch and outperforms RMA when analyzing multiple batches.

The risk of blindness due to progressive visual field (VF) loss varies substantially from patient to patient. Early identification of those patients destined to rapid progressive visual loss is crucial to prevent further damage. In this article, a latent class growth model (LCGM) was developed to predict the binary outcome of VF progression using longitudinal mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD). Specifically, the trajectories of MD and PSD were summarized by a functional principal component (FPC) analysis, and the estimated FPC scores were used to identify subgroups (latent classes) of individuals with distinct patterns of MD and PSD trajectories. Probability of VF progression for an individual was then estimated as weighted average across latent classes, weighted by posterior probability of class membership given baseline covariates and longitudinal MD/PSD series. The model was applied to the participants with newly diagnosed POAG from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS), and the OHTS data was best fit by a model with 4 latent classes. Using the resultant optimal LCGM, the OHTS participants with and without VF progression could be accurately differentiated by incorporating longitudinal MD and PSD.","inCitations":["1abdfcfb3893a4b81f613f0f235c6c8e9bb602fa"],"title":"Predicting Clinical Binary Outcome Using Multivariate Longitudinal Data: Application to Patients with Newly Diagnosed Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.","doi":"10.4172/2155-6180.1000254"}
