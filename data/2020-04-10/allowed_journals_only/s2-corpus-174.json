Methods are proposed to evaluate individual treatment heterogeneity (i.e., subject-treatment interaction) and its consequences in clinical experiments. The method of maximum likelihood is used to derive estimators and their properties. A bootstrap procedure that requires fewer assumptions is also presented as a small sample alternative to the maximum likelihood approach. It is shown that estimators for subject-treatment interaction are sensitive to an inestimable correlation parameter. This sensitivity is illustrated using some example data sets and using graphical plots. The practical consequence of subject-treatment interaction is that a proportion of the population may be not be responding to the treatment as indicated by the average treatment effect. Results obtained from the methods reported here can alert the practitioner to the possibility that individual treatment effects vary widely in the population and help to assess the potential consequences of this variation. Applications of the proposed procedures to clinical decision making, pharmacogenetic studies, and other contexts are discussed.","inCitations":["71d3f438bfe51c5bd10b46989eb35c0ffe458489","4d05952644ba1d45a8ec38b5d20f5e26b2ed72b6","0e28cd3f243c2750a11aced853c6b410e7b9e600","2caac7fea41555f0dc9748a998f1d94f55da4713","53493f75b373b6b8c8e7f525fa936dac26ef19a4","a8eded403c8dc458cc9efbb16428ea0bc9da8907","37e346e49f94b5ea7693d54ddd43ea87f1b43f70","f7408ef13330d553c389b7f3623e09435e49deb7","43642b62c09de51ef4c498cd4c564222a30af0ef","de8311837c4df9fc0ee2be8ae66f97d86007ce73","edf507e101f493e2bfa1a02c875ef2295e527194","bfdac825aac6521fb47fbb40e71e72ae1cdc7808","aa81450b8811debc658dd589081f73ba21306433"],"title":"Evaluating subject-treatment interaction when comparing two treatments.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120008851"}

Expressions for the population Fisher information matrix have been defined for uniresponse and multiresponse pharmacokinetic experiments. A major assumption often made is that the variance-covariance matrix of the interindividual variance components has only diagonal elements so that whenever intersubject covariance elements are present, they are ignored during the design of the experiment. Recently expressions that accounted for these off diagonal elements were developed for uniresponse population pharmacokinetic experiments. The work presented here extends these expressions to multiresponse population pharmacokinetic experiments. These were applied to a population pharmacokinetic model, a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model, and a parent-metabolite pharmacokinetic model example. The results obtained showed that optimal designs are different with diagonal omega matrix and full omega matrix and ignoring the off diagonal elements can lead to a design that produces more biased and less precise parameter estimates compared to a design that includes the off diagonal elements. The results also showed correlation between residual components of the responses has an effect on the optimal design.","inCitations":["d4d705db1a78856313358539e84249f7a6ac1947","20bd27e346f42174fe338e9d64bf0e856275389c","d414d8e9237b23f7fb34b4113fd527889a7cacc6","7990d9ff83eea3c5a3607c76e61e451c3d6d7e40","094513a3c0dbdfffee8c1407775dc489b0abead5","b969ce8edb9a75b5d92353fc24be9da230f03af2","708857b59a65cda6fafc6d99c31d175720e75cb4"],"title":"Incorporating correlation in interindividual variability for the optimal design of multiresponse pharmacokinetic experiments.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701697208"}

In this paper, we developed a hybrid frequentist-Bayesian continual reassessment method (CRM) in conjunction with utility-adaptive randomization for clinical trial designs with multiple endpoints. The proposed hyperlogistic function family with multiple parameters gives users flexibility for probability modeling. CRM reassesses a dose-response relationship based on accrued data of the on-going trial, which allows investigators to make decisions based on a constantly updated dose-response model. The proposed utility-adaptive randomization for multiple-endpoint trials allows more patients to be assigned to superior treatment groups. The performance of the proposed method was examined in terms of its operating characteristics through computer simulations.","inCitations":["fad25638ddd6c1ee27d3d1421bb5f9b85ad024f5","d1a16dd6440646926ee201953e06bd4545e8ff8c","ae502f97262ceabba26f8ce471caf2583e9d0da5","e68ba97310e70136f94813c019dae5b4bad86698","0482e4c276e31c003b9e8ea1c35ab6c8ee66e3c9","d7f59ad1c1a54bcc9009420ed87c552fef638a34","6f632d6bf20bfc8dfbb731cf5bd46eb038bc9f5e","71b86834e749b8c76a999f28c349f5417b08c355","45762849cabf131f1d92388537ccc34b2fb9ff78","ca9c3024a19c861aa5ccbe67ce81b1969369781b","e78533f9f6e834ffa0743f7b64e449902e46b335","96e4f5aa6a7008d2a0b06269a7fc34fd644b78fb"],"title":"A hybrid Bayesian adaptive design for dose response trials.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200062288"}

Due to the complexity of the distributions of these estimators, the confidence intervals obtained from the bootstrap method were used for testing the hypothesis of dissolution similarity. The size and power of two procedures are examined with a simulation study.

We propose an inference method which allows to build in hierarchical structures. It relies on repeated sample splitting and sequential rejection, and we prove that it asymptotically controls the familywise error rate. It can be implemented on any collection of clusters and leads to improved power in comparison to more standard non-sequential rejection methods.

Most methods have some degree of systematic bias in one-sided coverage, so that a nominal 95% two-sided interval cannot be assumed to have tail probabilities of 2.5% at each end, and any associated hypothesis test is at risk of inflated type I error rate. Skewness-corrected asymptotic score methods have been shown to have superior equal-tailed coverage properties for the binomial case. This paper completes this class of methods by introducing novel skewness corrections for the Poisson case and for odds ratio, with and without stratification. Graphical methods are used to compare the performance of these intervals against selected alternatives. The skewness-corrected methods perform favourably in all situations-including those with small sample sizes or rare events-and the skewness correction should be considered essential for analysis of rate ratios. The stratified method is found to have excellent coverage properties for a fixed effects analysis. In addition, another new stratified score method is proposed, based on the t-distribution, which is suitable for use in either a fixed effects or random effects analysis. By using a novel weighting scheme, this approach improves on conventional and modern meta-analysis methods with weights that rely on crude estimation of stratum variances. In summary, this paper describes methods that are found to be robust for a wide range of applications in the analysis of rates.","inCitations":["bbcc71f10d2b9279008e3ced6855fb6a0f4081c6","df606b8c8ae46f0276311f8b922aad4b2f2fada8"],"title":"Equal-tailed confidence intervals for comparison of rates.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1813"}

Data from Malaysia reveal that concentration of child mortality in some families is imperfectly explained by observed explanatory variables, and that failure to control for unobserved heterogeneity seriously biases the parameter estimates.","inCitations":["5129be19ea63cd43636a7173434cca78a0e152af","e11759310fd2803153ea95d798d62c2c0b77bca9","f53c5d2ba14251f64c1dbe89edce30135c8fd270","59571dadc6a8b4d3ba3995a478c943f8e2e38402","1e88ecdc10f1bcf8dd5f1644ecc251a9259cb712","f997eef8853c80b467a4cff7dc9cfbde2fbe5585","66db02d78c6415515e732e91503f164baa939992","4be0cce95b681ab5044cbcc825dfb2581e0c0ab9","02a83e1d5db9a7eb200257b5945c42a643cbee95","1502f04302ad23514b6513c1911cd9fc7c37799a","b0a2d181bfc9fdb6298ba3bda33f1f87e7b76db0","60495d7f9f7793e16be956613a1921a6d3373a49","ab199660130383349eee86ff24a8652d84865f8d","770043a0ca60ffc1352b828ac380581c4998545d","8a2dfa038bd282045bd5719e8bc53cc640215752","ad0056ac36b54b55e86062d0c6a461abc661e23d","d66446b18fb221d1885f9a29801e32d6dc2bb669","7b975556915279056549553046e97f811494821b","0cbd9012395733ef6de67ce9dd215c7b431876b5","355543829590d35993dc9856da942f586297a375","c200aeeb90f0e752b2e0fbb6a292f84b6b049401","cd4282d2adecc2f97d943c585b2b985d8cc05a5e","06692d3dbf66560f250e3b4d8261469fc4bc4dcd","d9bd4b6e437950d1a661bf3733c4f4e9ebe9d4d9","3930ec32f022b2d235ec54820576cda77d0ba268","4994fc9fec9287553e27ce980360a77f4f379f17","f83135102cafd42745e1e3081ff5e2b8d2a48944","fa5d308e8a4b746247a2527354ab4d7e26f5b61b","3aa4d071d8653a26c71f3368dccedb7dd88eeaba","5514739f71ec684353088912556a673b6a0f517d","0f7fe7a14934d294425a3512b099cd866e28112a","7faf93a1a8d02b0aabbfc185339e36fb4a1b79dc","5078fa25fba44a104ce70841aafc61825faaaa25","c482a2767d3a4c47aa3c79ce1f64821c980ff334","2d41f032b55d371efcabeac55b6ed88aa3091a85","361c19de4e0843a31743039ffc80bd96a6a985d3","fd833aedd32b3a056cb5b26c3181f239ab4767d5","edcca4d72c2a8a4107a600f14059a1968a745b5c","2570c9c1e958d1fdc0dea643b2bd326cac35683f","be8c03996b2a5189966dce0b9d57c73e3f2ac538","ff67a55c48c32e03dcf6323f287aff0087733129","e54a00c34665c0cb4365d84fb546b39d64d21648","8ffb1adef1e97bef8d6a9015b739464625a948a8","026d931f7148925d684cdae8114886900f422a51","be74df70f43f2ec923e46e985e4f95e26d74acf1","d22bb7623d93cd90b78da145aa6a0ce6575d52da","20fc34c5560fe4766f9fcf9b6ee466aa3494a01f","6f2a04c4065de8c8f9c91ce59707d5d76cd81d10","765e4d62976485eeacae8f01d396dc43209d7bea","5ebf6d3ce3e24dcdbf6c37c9f41d19549991d5da","ed4428b4d5e56267c6a3d49cd9d839f2c28637cd","216b88109b5666fa09aad3f18774d913ca9c66bd","943117f71207fc87a6436e3d0877c87c68206d67","348e9bf590c3b23fec8a948fc0079c579881ded2","3524f1f780fec85ad7febf0db1ffbf5061182148","6b95e99227715e25b5b612a3738a9eca270700a6","97145217b034298ab09b0f19938a8771e9f8a393","7875f3c56a4e0135f4382718bdbae9a027c96ec0","b421ddbc61afc56593b110988ebd8b4eaf049036","7da71d827c2422a33a37e6e160076d64efdc9ba9","3ef0b9d5f60f6a3aff066d6cace6b4ec6ead5b80","848491a408d7c439683ffe9fbbdec603470bd201","a487a85e91e7fc6cd417ee42df0ae7061de72851","cce2c569ee4a524683ac628649ff57cdf67dd899","2e9650783f04cb14cd90a58398e4eaa2f1be9262","46e245122938d1afe82812a13024ef62989f0cc2","071a8b87610852852a538c6fb2faa703ae65cbb1","523bb1402d8a37de753e06a8f92467f2974d4dee","771e82346d5eefa82918271ebdc1a902232a7d62","650f81388380d9775eb773b017987ae337ff4936","739a321e81d24a94c7a207bef9d4cc0540873685","7b9aa5a8c8df3cf7e38253d340e45fcb2ca2c5d1","a742afef8f10bb63288cc92a08c09e9deb735e2d","9e1cc0cb099db0240de8c4ddd85a6d33708fd7a5","e266f8fb5429940801e0e8623b528830c0cfca7f","f6abaab33a052ef75929c0d5850ab22e0ac00f2e","ad8bdb315b8b1273612941e5ec5eca5e1840c558","8b8345b68ff79f371910e0ad038a254e12f7df91","e1e1ac3f56fc9e2e7340a72a4f47a97c748e2f57","2f05955626b01e457227cacf803e654bd113aac7","c908fffeff03b87fd8897afd1675552ab729931b","9ba32dd3205ca6631ae7be0a344140eb7231936c","8704ea98282a84e3643cd0e017c3b9c54c743195","2d58935247ccc77aec944f9115fb7cdc80411cd9","3d1f87c4fef57f1b27efd6d8daedc9de8ad4597a","49428072d7a12112e1442dabd4748d3a871c5f60","03dd0e9990cf5612228f9aca8d02b9fd40441e6a","a1f1fac5dff4463def206556cdb4437d00e56a25","1a8fe3133d357d4ea7ab55ca5fa5277e072c5ea6","e5b11130c01115fda44afe8a13c2746acaeab842","b4cf5ce4cbe3d1a7e553b6f76381b43b0a7e6df2","cd31c497bee313051d2521130b3d8999afe2b2d6","ba3636c83bea4679383433a11c78770430008e01","3cfd18f7700776c87a69edf15c0fe00c7c5994b6","6cc35f2a48fa1a04905aad0fa4296310ab786b6e","e7c9dc8cad403906e4e84df99d9f6b1343bfeb47"],"title":"Stratified partial likelihood estimation.","doi":"10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00090-6"}

Data generated from qHTS assays are then evaluated using nonlinear regression models, such as the Hill model, and decisions regarding toxicity are made using the estimates of the parameters of the model. For any given compound, the variability in the observed response may either be constant across dose groups (homoscedasticity) or vary with dose (heteroscedasticity). Since thousands of compounds are simultaneously evaluated in a qHTS assay, it is not practically feasible for an investigator to perform residual analysis to determine the variance structure before performing statistical inferences on each compound. Since it is well-known that the variance structure plays an important role in the analysis of linear and nonlinear regression models it is therefore important to have practically useful and easy to interpret methodology which is robust to the variance structure. Furthermore, given the number of chemicals that are investigated in the qHTS assay, outliers and influential observations are not uncommon. In this article we describe preliminary test estimation (PTE) based methodology which is robust to the variance structure as well as any potential outliers and influential observations. Performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated in terms of false discovery rate (FDR) and power using a simulation study mimicking a real qHTS data. Of the two methods currently in use, our simulations studies suggest that one is extremely conservative with very small power in comparison to the proposed PTE based method whereas the other method is very liberal. In contrast, the proposed PTE based methodology achieves a better control of FDR while maintaining good power. The proposed methodology is illustrated using a data set obtained from the National Toxicology Program (NTP). Additional information, simulation results, data and computer code are available online as supplementary materials.","inCitations":["f3692f1c28e3a479c54822efb02d6189156f13fc","3c73189fb6387fc26e2559365aba8e5206be1c86","f08c67e73c1f1ba17e4b880acecdfea47ee2ac88","0ce1ff72e9315694974daba00138d8645de93777","c5c272dc5c5fd071d1da844863241b73d4178f4b"],"title":"Robust Analysis of High Throughput Screening (HTS) Assay Data","doi":"10.1080/00401706.2012.749166"}

It remains to adapt many standard statistical methods commonly used for analyzing gene expression levels to take advantage of this additional information. One novel question is whether we can find clusters of samples that are distinguished not by their gene expression but by their isoform usage. We propose a novel approach for clustering mRNA‐Seq data that identifies such clusters. We show via simulation that our methods are more sensitive to finding clusters based on isoform usage than standard clustering techniques. We demonstrate its performance by finding a technical artifact that resulted in different batches having different isoform usage patterns, and illustrate its usage on several The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets.","inCitations":["a93c6f0eeec4e3901349ef094e4be7ca1a5cba1b"],"title":"Clustering of mRNA‐Seq data based on alternative splicing patterns","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw044"}

The first is use of Empirical Bayes (EB) methods to handle the large number of potentially-sparse effects, and estimate false discovery rates and related quantities. The second is use of factor analysis methods to deal with sources of unwanted variation such as batch effects and unmeasured confounders. We describe a simple modular fitting procedure that combines key ideas from both these lines of research. This yields new, powerful EB methods for analyzing genomics experiments that account for both sparse effects and unwanted variation. In realistic simulations, these new methods provide significant gains in power and calibration over competing methods. In real data analysis, we find that different methods, while often conceptually similar, can vary widely in their assessments of statistical significance. This highlights the need for care in both choice of methods and interpretation of results.","inCitations":["04a933e98e230309a69ee5b0a8f4adb44ebd5cde","48257528d2d9422d2bf4afa02c203f1d803d7d17","d8e7a03c6ee282130425e170dd3927165aaad1a1","c2808902508a4a5950db1191854ab43e3c237c9d"],"title":"Empirical Bayes shrinkage and false discovery rate estimation, allowing for unwanted variation.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy029"}

When X is high dimensional, parametric approaches to incorporate X - information is encumbered by the risk of model misspecification and nonparametric approaches by the curse of dimensionality. We propose a semiparametric approach, which is developed under a nonparametric kernel regression framework, but with a parametric working index to condense the high dimensional X - information for reduced dimension. This kernel dimension reduction estimator has double robustness to model misspecification and is most efficient if the working index adequately conveys the X - information about the distribution of Y. Numerical studies indicate better performance of the semiparametric estimator over its parametric and nonparametric counterparts. We apply the kernel dimension reduction estimation to an HIV study for the effect of antiretroviral therapy on HIV virologic suppression.","inCitations":["b7bf531814091f71a2cf23cd4cbbbe7ecd0f0340","bc44f9555142f29d266efc5e56516d6f68086b44","0a0ba3d8d7d37c8aadf1502b3865854e04d22e8f"],"title":"Dimension reduced kernel estimation for distribution function with incomplete data.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2011.03.030"}

It is possible to derive a goodness-of-fit test of this assumption, but in practice sample sizes will not be large enough to make complete testing feasible. In such a situation a partial testing procedure is advocated, together with studies of robustness. A numerical example is given illustrating how the partial testing procedure may detect instances of distributions which have normally distributed marginals but which are not multivariate normal.","inCitations":["477a5b3b3bcd8735a3f0c0a2f2812b9c4e03680d","84d6b3bb35358f69a88ba1deb0530c2335485e4d"],"title":"The assumption of multivariate normality.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1967.tb00378.x"}

However, in certain settings, this behavior might not be desirable: if some features are highly correlated with each other and associated with the response, then we might wish to perform less shrinkage on the coefficients corresponding to that subset of features. We propose the cluster elastic net, which selectively shrinks the coefficients for such variables towards each other, rather than towards the origin. Instead of assuming that the clusters are known a priori, the cluster elastic net infers clusters of features from the data, on the basis of correlation among the variables as well as association with the response. These clusters are then used in order to more accurately perform regression. We demonstrate the theoretical advantages of our proposed approach, and explore its performance in a simulation study, and in an application to HIV drug resistance data.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2009,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"It is often necessary to compare two measurement methods in medicine and other experimental sciences. This problem covers a broad range of data. Many authors have explored ways of assessing the agreement of two sets of measurements. However, there has been relatively little attention to the problem of determining sample size for designing an agreement study. In this paper, a method using the interval approach for concordance is proposed to calculate sample size in conducting an agreement study. The philosophy behind this is that the concordance is satisfied when no more than the pre-specified k discordances are found for a reasonable large sample size n since it is much easier to define a discordance pair. The goal here is to find such a reasonable large sample size n. The sample size calculation is based on two rates: the discordance rate and tolerance probability, which in turn can be used to quantify an agreement study. The proposed approach is demonstrated through a real data set.","inCitations":["a15beb522119b12396177fb4b550fbafcef8a1ee","0c1377b5ee66ebe9685424274df1a612c6b273a2","a5bffbb40b10069d5a6894cea2185d49726751a0","d247814c9a941054fbb6bfbc26f5e0c52c3be0b4","5734e70ade6ee96dcb0e9451a279ece0be3e4f4e","fb4df53e1ade320fe6074f0d005fe78ebaf5215d","ab797034baeea0664b49e69347585c37599113fd","a6b97d4cdb8189d369ca9887db40dec17668877c","76c0fa51b23fa55be2b0c9943496c94de6dcf185","6db3655904cfe310f91dce35eb8695044c97ced9","a5607c9b2e019c31660c0b98f2ecb9972de4aa66","0722b40abd0c086a35ebd03691c8efb1ed0df5c6","6a833461c91ae6268543428a1a7d6e12d99c71f0","bea900cd3ad6428b3eadc671bab2fcb6498766c3","8c184364eb8e8e7e2af80bd9a02fae661566830f","73c703ff3959e70446af340afe4a5e842a2239b8","0c2d95b2b5a05e49f165ddacf188368699c5636e","6adfa8ecc77f295d7306f5715bf7d2d849650e9f","5d1aed3400315e8b03084b7bf5fff271b6a2002d","d869c60d1df85abcfbb3250345f7652a2c87432f","f788a101ad3c97f27b190baf8c39625cf46bad7d","587e782edede5eff69b2af54524e6ad920cc4623"],"title":"Sample size calculation for an agreement study.","doi":"10.1002/pst.382"}

Reintroduction of the disease through contact with infected individuals from other areas is an important latent stochastic variable. In this study we model these stochastic processes to explain extinction and recurrence of epidemics observed in measles. We develop estimating functions for such a model and apply the methodology to temporal case counts of measles in 60 cities in England and Wales. In order to estimate the unobserved spatial contact process we suggest a method based on stochastic simulation and marginal densities. The estimation results show that it is possible to consider a unified model for the UK cities where the parameters depend on the city size. Stochastic realizations from the dynamic model realistically capture the transitions from an endemic cyclic pattern in large populations to irregular epidemic outbreaks in small human host populations.","inCitations":["d764077c01cb5961e05e6a088ac8d26b62a01356","2fde03a91559f284d0b5bd9500b38314a30763a8","1710ef52cb8db3b8f9f4c11b1e3601f6de64f919","cd636243915da554f4baaa3195f10649131a8a1f","e7a13a3c9796eb48475c8c7d76ff3308787fd85f","c3ed1593779ecc8d26a90840f47d01f6fea8aa57","68fd00c40b367d09a8643b1546b4bc7caa35ff3d","9444feb5d55c67588e310bc745c7fa6183ccabba","48512d195887e7fe36003d0bf7f7d779d9bbda6c","3e6b094883aec794fdb37ee35c24817532ab8b5e","04ad5932a87530fd28481228cfaf93bfb06fa5eb","3940d88c14168af792674d0284117bbb02155a9c","ae0a99318fa7c57e1cae063dfc2d23556b76b5bb","aee0769269d3bf4a40a9d9a8e96c1d8e78d18036","daa68338eae018b5f3d0fa66f86cc07f65e8ef1c","841966b2803f6e1f3fcfa455a0e0b6b9e463e858","7ed24d1c6f408d15c30dc5391e67d02936e34538","91b6e6a867abca446f467eeadcdbbfda198af6a1","87c86ae2961206266d2d2d2f11c785b07a61e018","53e2a979ed2e3ebfb6bda5c477866632d9f32f1f","9d8adb33a95d12fc0e8fe1944ca235749a592eec","68e032c3a43aea0636561961fa27f2facf6ef3ce","6eb9137169efc98da44fbbb81481d7329b2e05c2","3e8b253b44e20612adc26aeeba8a75c5242947b0","ab7d9d117b0341303b9179f7eb7d5ab23b0da769","a4860aeadf8a51f4702262a58b808ea851eb4c27","7804b4631fa953843a97e7cee4683cb06d402201","1823e23275e3fc5ab616b075eacd40294688345c","4682072a8dfeccf7838e7fd16b5aebe165830174","5b7c79779335779edff17f2d553e932e25f88229","9b0548b98a5a790ad7a73467ccbd7ab37f1286dc","c11b139e059a8a002e5bc6527a1172118699bedb","9be3bf64a7b48ee9df0d20e833237d761e94b244","1f19364cddbc4302fc198316e04c576215050405","b467898494da81df81d24c9ffd73b21d297c6bf9","febda374b91f980fcac8119a054c521fc89faded","925359acfe5ab33dfb070a5f113ba46b5b45701c","f271eb4e5c389cb83df07c171b19170447f15509","7e80636acdb815250f7e813a2da06a241a54b769","27aef3a00dee01aaef8ccd3d7d132743b6eda73c","20cfa56ccd30293b26d7481dde05b75eca9143c5","38365a6b80a8bec5198ee1f34cb2a645eaee7a3f","87beeed54dad9642eb72d22491998bd9db502a97","12ce59f699cc303ec13cab53a7fed104dbb003ff","7712f4874faae117d5c65566586c07b09bff38e0","1e83023faa05a628bcbdb222733b0780ed5cb7aa","58229569f00217f176a614a6c1e7eefa30b12d8c"],"title":"A stochastic model for extinction and recurrence of epidemics: estimation and inference for measles outbreaks.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.4.493"}
