Assessment of the effect of a particular risk factor on the change in pain severity will shed light on our understanding of biological mechanisms and provide guidance for rational clinical intervention for recurrent pain. The multistate transition model allows transitions between several different states of pain severity and estimates the transitional intensity using an extension of the Cox proportional hazards model. Using data from a longitudinal study, we applied this model to assess the relation of two psychological factors to the change in knee pain severity over time among patients with osteoarthritis and demonstrated that the multistate transition model can be a valuable tool for rheumatic disease studies.","inCitations":["2aa8f54c1dc188ec03a7909cec4e623fc50c6c01"],"title":"A Multistate Transition Model for Osteoarthritis Pain Change.","doi":"10.1080/03610920902940167"}

The difficulties for the analysis, as in any errors-in-variables problem lies in the lack of identifiability of the model and the need to introduce questionable and often naïve assumptions in order to gain identifiability. Although not a panacea, the use of instrumental variables and associated instrumental variable (IV) regression methods in this area of application has great potential to improve the situation. Large samples are frequently needed and two-phase sampling methods are introduced to improve the efficiency of the IV estimators.","inCitations":["547976ae526e4deefa9623325e1297a5b37c5e6b","692344619fdf799e1db9dc7e3464b242ae5b7d21","be961a916225467bd8c4146e48b93bba4798b716","089c57a7cc0e8de99ef26b6e32e2f7b551bf286e","9fb80036690fb32b03df0959e6c174d8b9472112","d74974f6ca21b2428e40be617e20f32c2fd3fe9e","dfd9b09e7452e429c8651b97e47691219c6714b2","1b091df9af95289b48572f39c702c1fa6078b4f7","b74fa1511db0dea944df1a82794ff1d7eb02641d","313dd66aad0d3b6bd433729d84eab03ea031ea50","90fb09abd4aeea083aa4a92f740cd6da4a198739","14ef2934060cbec8a9dae5f32bf0c643dd897c05","a0cc334bdf21babbaa197fc95eac5ac1fef03988","443b99e329f53b3f830cec6f2a2109d2e8477079","c3d4c5fc95c9b9acde1a5b3d9fe6d792f7dadd9e","3124b96c3b8883857faa4aa50cda7264c8f9447a","c32a74c5f22702930aa6861aab22a76ac9796c49","8b8780a761b52f6ed3c3ae484c729c0f957fd452","0f9bdad2e9aaa764310dbd7556b813857517577a"],"title":"Regression models for method comparison data.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701329513"}

To control the overall type I error, for testing one hypothesis, several approaches have been proposed to construct a statistic so that its distribution is independent to the SSRE under the null hypothesis. We considered a similar approach for comparisons between multiple treatment arms and placebo, allowing the change of sample sizes in all arms depending on interim information. A construction of statistics similar to that for a single hypothesis test is proposed. When the changes of sample sizes in different arms are proportional, we show that one-step and stepwise Dunnett tests can be used directly on statistics constructed in the proposed way. The approach can also be applied to clinical trials with SSRE and treatment selection at interim. The proposed approach is evaluated with simulations under different situations.","inCitations":["920f3ea3416cac09ff6b70d01bac940a293d2846"],"title":"Many-to-one comparison after sample size reestimation for trials with multiple treatment arms and treatment selection.","doi":"10.1080/10543401003618959"}

The major propositions derived and posited in this paper lend considerable support to intuitive notions with respect to the effects of anxiety on human behaviour in risky decision situations. Namely, that the willingness of an individual to pay to reduce health risks (an economic indicator of individual welfare associated with reduced morbidity or increased longevity) tends to be positive and higher when anxiety is present than when it is not. The formal results of the analysis show that when psychological considerations are incorporated into a state-dependent utility model, the normative results customarily obtained concerning value-of-life need to be qualified.","inCitations":["d5340cc8d9d342e8203f170e2664e59ae643a6d5"],"title":"Anxiety: towards a decision-theoretic perspective.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1990.tb00923.x"}

We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of the maximum partial likelihood estimate (MPLE) for completely observed data (i.e., no missing data) settings as well as sufficient conditions for existence of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for survival data with missing covariates via a profile likelihood method. Several theorems are given to establish these conditions.

Drugs that share a molecular target may also have some common predictive omic features, e.g., somatic mutations or gene expression. Therefore, it is desirable to analyze these drugs as a group to identify the associated omic features, which may provide biological insights into the underlying drug response. Furthermore, these omic features may be robust predictors for any drug sharing the same target. The high dimensionality and the strong correlations among the omic features are the main challenges of this task. Motivated by this problem, we develop a new method for high‐dimensional bilevel feature selection using a group of response variables that may share a common set of predictors in addition to their individual predictors. Simulation results show that our method has a substantially higher sensitivity and specificity than existing methods. We apply our method to two large‐scale drug sensitivity studies in cancer cell lines. Both within‐study and between‐study validation demonstrate the good efficacy of our method.","inCitations":["6873020f76332bbb51d87dcac32a0fc2efeb7780"],"title":"Prediction of cancer drug sensitivity using high‐dimensional omic features","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw022"}

Recent methods for analysing such data have treated these relational variables as continuous. A more appropriate method, described here, views these dyadic interactions as variables in multidimensional discrete cross-classified arrays, thus permitting analysis by log-linear models. These methods extend previous approaches to social interaction data, which were limited to binary relations, by focusing on discrete-valued relations. Dyadic interactions, measured for a single discrete relational variable, are modelled stochastically using tendencies towards expansiveness (actor-effects), popularity (partner-effects) and reciprocity. Actor-characteristic variables may be used to group actors into a substantive partition, thus simplifying the analysis and subsequent interpretations.","inCitations":["ba22a9712acc94588edcfe6c2243d5a2daa50fc3","4e4635caf0912a38b9fb757e8844cccf7dabdf22","19953041ef34ed53dc33e760ed4b0bdd31218e5c","b9facd7239aa82b5e939459db36953f462253624","a6bf4e677d971785d94b31e4283604bdfa014f9d","2dfd0b0b7027cba30c38e027abb342db675d9e80","285beb273cce56ff50e129ab8a0b3ad3e7b9b3f5","d26309b01b049e6a984696a8bee61dda4b9cb812","48b7bc45092e9839543dfe6430f701860eda34f2","c64b882ad274034df7f10b252d3503ff493be5d6","7d23065c040140709486a4b8348523888862231f"],"title":"Statistical analysis of discrete relational data.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1986.tb00844.x"}

However, designing and tuning MCMC algorithms for each new distribution, can be challenging and time consuming. It is particularly difficult to create an efficient sampler when there is strong dependence among the variables in a multivariate distribution. We describe a two-pronged approach for constructing efficient, automated MCMC algorithms: (1) we propose the \"factor slice sampler\", a generalization of the univariate slice sampler where we treat the selection of a coordinate basis (factors) as an additional tuning parameter, and (2) we develop an approach for automatically selecting tuning parameters in order to construct an efficient factor slice sampler. In addition to automating the factor slice sampler, our tuning approach also applies to the standard univariate slice samplers. We demonstrate the efficiency and general applicability of our automated MCMC algorithm with a number of illustrative examples.","inCitations":["5dbb68978c906c3dc209f3cd27110751f56916d9","6bb1e622edf2843f2364c08cd6a144459bed06a9","a71b10167645fb7a1ce7ef71f762cde2be1e945e","2cc3ccd1be984194764b266af7a9d224573affe8","8c7e8d1afe3f5b9dbc8f2e5c0f7a1860c1835928","76bbb6ec29a0fa9f3ee67d3746f4de6854c6901b","d85c2253f83dbf030377d4daa4d1e814dde1859d","e48ee0d95b34aa8ce158bdd84f80d671351268e5","ede41cd499725c656fc8a72fe47aaceb934acbb3","9441f5987da176cd82ba7abe5f28615d302f6495","eab74e4547ff5387595afedb63a41e65a54301dd","853d4f8ad88ff2f99ac523757d012a665dc4e82f"],"title":"Automated Factor Slice Sampling.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2013.791193"}

This means that subjects' observation times will be irregular and related to subject-specific factors. Previously proposed methods for handling such panel count data assume that the dependence between the events process and the observation time process is governed by time-independent factors. This article considers situations where the observation times are predicted by time-varying factors such as the outcome observed at the last visit or cumulative exposure. Using a joint modelling approach, we propose a class of inverse-intensity-rate-ratio weighted estimators that are root-n consistent and asymptotically normal.

In one such setting, we address subtleties involved in inference for causal effects when using a key covariate to predict membership in latent principal strata. We show that when treatment received can differ from treatment assigned in both study arms, incorporating a stratum-predictive covariate can make estimates of the \"complier average causal effect\" (CACE) derive from observations in the two treatment arms with different covariate distributions. Adopting a Bayesian perspective and using Markov chain Monte Carlo for computation, we develop posterior checks that characterize the extent to which incorporating the pretreatment covariate endangers estimation of the CACE. We apply the method to analyze a clinical trial comparing two treatments for jaw fractures in which the study protocol allowed surgeons to overrule both possible randomized treatment assignments based on their clinical judgment and the data contained a key covariate (injury severity) predictive of treatment received.","inCitations":["a2530552a5f5d216ff7357e12a6298fd3f41ec12","2db0382378c8c41213d5ae5dc9b9dc161872418d","6417031cbe56ef349cd5a14ea683eaa4f604ade1","b47ce14e6ffb17bd91c7e22d520b02fb5e1aeca1","e6ae880fde7a144b4559c29f3f8a156bcae70726","a5be33d888c2f985b1ab545fef30f4b28158e8be","df5bb8b37b0071826ae5281e23c61db0a87154ad","54acf3a3c239db81c41723b528d2baa513aa8ce9"],"title":"The Potential for Bias in Principal Causal Effect Estimation When Treatment Received Depends on a Key Covariate.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS477"}

We cast the problem as an unusual and not previously studied hierarchical mixed-effects model characterized by completely missing covariates in units at a structurally base level, except for some randomly selected units. Information concerning the missing covariates is available through certain known ordering constraints and surrogate measures. Our methods use Bayesian machinery. We exploit the biological structure of this problem to generate the missing covariates simultaneously and efficiently at the base levels, as opposed to the naive practice of generating units at the base levels one-at-a-time with Metropolis-Hastings steps. We apply our methods to show that different regions of the colon have different architectures, and to estimate an important but non-standard function that measures the interrelationship of DNA damage mechanisms in different regions of the colon.","inCitations":["af72718c6be42ae8b04176702532807ef82738cb","94a32c4fee152bdcb60f1f00aa78ebadcf7cdcea","5925c0d2857f62264a6a3ff277f7451db946a10c"],"title":"A Bayesian analysis of colonic crypt structure and coordinated response to carcinogen exposure incorporating missing crypts.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/3.4.529"}

Sample size calculations for this kind of analyses require knowledge of the magnitude of nuisance parameters that are usually not given when the results of clinical trials are reported in the literature. It is therefore quite natural to start with a preliminary calculated sample size based on the sparse information available in the planning phase and to re-estimate the value of the nuisance parameters (and with it the sample size) when a portion of the planned number of patients have completed the study. We investigate the characteristics of this internal pilot study design when an analysis of covariance with normally distributed outcome and one random covariate is applied. For this purpose we first assess the accuracy of four approximate sample size formulae within the fixed sample size design. Then the performance of the recalculation procedure with respect to its actual Type I error rate and power characteristics is examined. The results of simulation studies show that this approach has favorable properties with respect to the Type I error rate and power. Together with its simplicity, these features should make it attractive for practical application.","inCitations":["3cbda64520da291972e0a4026840d1dfc9c1f625","090e6c9926263ba0563f37609187801e257fc229","159d6346a8c423bcc5284e4cd1f6c4ad892b1fac","f6def0b049734606d70f85f96e9216658ce6d8dd","f8816d7ff8a4b51a8e7fdede6ad67dc4a2cd10d9","5384a4edb89ef180f2b06a5ea351a2bd2c13d8cc","8258bd15f8343bf1628a8ef6de7c9d5bf37cff91","e8269f2071766ba8e90037c38f258e65379a26ae","096dc542e6ea77ca2b7527136fc7b5bbadf24610","a67259d1ecb502c5a901ab7b28d9f52115f2080e","fe33fa77a0cf3a9cc99a0681db97bce97786dec0","6ad89a74053d330cab98cf0751145a041558389e"],"title":"Blinded sample size recalculation for clinical trials with normal data and baseline adjusted analysis.","doi":"10.1002/pst.398"}

This article is focused on the recognition of overpresented short patterns, called \"motifs\", that may correspond to regulatory binding sites in the DNA sequences upstream of genes. An integrated Bayesian model is proposed to incorporate all unknown characteristics in motif discovery, including the number of motifs, motif widths, motif compositions, the number of motif sites, and locations of motif sites. Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo is used to obtain posterior inference in the transdimensional parameter space. We present a number of suggestions for graphical summarization of the posterior distribution over the complex parameter space. The basic model is extended using a third-order Markov structure for nonmotif bases and allowing positions within a motif to be switched between 2 types: \"conserved\" and \"degenerate.\" We evaluate the prediction accuracy for the simulated data with 3 motifs and apply the model to upstream sequences in high signal-to-noise regions in a human ChIP-chip study. The performance of the Bayesian model is assessed using yeast data sets of various numbers of sequences and background structures, with and without true TFBSs. The performance is also compared to other computational methods, including 2 statistical approaches, AlignACE and multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation, and 1 word numeration-based approach, yeast motif finder (YMF).","inCitations":["0f445d63ac4e254a0cb17b35c9e84cead9b9e164","8867698a4671138dfda8bb5ad48ea7122dc368d6","1b7501257b845f8360524b18cd90e99f08370d48"],"title":"A transdimensional Bayesian model for pattern recognition in DNA sequences.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm058"}

The data take the form of counts of the cumulative number of events detected at each inspection time, along with explanatory covariates. Examples arise in diverse areas such as epidemiological studies, medical follow-up studies, reliability studies, and tumorigenicity experiments. This article is concerned with regression analysis of multivariate panel count data which arise if more than one type of recurrent event is of interest and individuals are only observed intermittently. We present a class of marginal mean models which leave the dependence structures for related types of recurrent events completely unspecified. Estimating equations are developed for regression parameters, and the resulting estimates are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Simulation studies show that the proposed estimation procedures work well for practical situations. The methodology is applied to a motivating study of patients with psoriatic arthritis in which the events of interest are the onset of joint damage according to 2 different criteria.","inCitations":["57c6546d15097c91f2dc1bc4be531a77da37f3a4","3c5f2558320e4f2b4a4945ed794e825692fd027b","65b15feaecf897e91b1b28263bfee36529fe413d","364af7e73515801bcf46f0d5d517d65428c41b67","918b56ae86f2a93726e87d0b0e83d8933b218b9e","459c19a3faf8cf7aef1db6b07e1c68cf70e2c8ee","4443edca681660f8f9161c346f111d64a680e105","5f1bfa25f7dbd40a4f345490abbabb4da3a253b7","8c7b6a54328a27f08aca5675dd8b6139690d3dc8","6876b8c25470343f9c3d93d5b877e2782af75c85","2629ed4b2344ebb3f0c9ac947dae3f6fc719cde1","33b7be4ecaf7571924697c07886c727776f8f479"],"title":"Regression analysis of multivariate panel count data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm025"}

Journal of the American Statistical Association 84, 487-493.)'s conditional hazard ratio to evaluate cause-specific associations in bivariate competing risks data. In many population-based family studies, one observes complex multivariate competing risks data, where the family sizes may be > 2, certain marginals may be exchangeable, and there may be multiple correlated relative pairs having a given pairwise association. Methods for bivariate competing risks data are inadequate in these settings. We show that the rank correlation estimator of Bandeen-Roche and Liang (2002) extends naturally to general clustered family structures. Consistency, asymptotic normality, and variance estimation are easily obtained with U-statistic theories. A natural by-product is an easily implemented test for constancy of the association over different time regions. In the Cache County Study on Memory in Aging, familial associations in dementia onset are of interest, accounting for death prior to dementia. The proposed methods using all available data suggest attenuation in dementia associations at later ages, which had been somewhat obscured in earlier analyses.","inCitations":["72f05d9d507c65e6b131a04c8d8be651fdd2e6f8","8a853a9ae91503e9740f9f6c05786f420ff7b502","7eacf455122b9cdcf1b3552d93f7e2878822ac5a"],"title":"Association analyses of clustered competing risks data via cross hazard ratio.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp039"}

Most papers regarding noninferiority trials only state Type I error rate without mentioning clearly which Type I error rate is evaluated. Therefore, the Type I error rate in one paper is often different from the Type I error rate in another paper, which can confuse readers and makes it difficult to understand papers. Which Type I error rate should be evaluated is related directly to which paradigm is employed in the analysis of noninferiority trial, and to how the historical data are treated. This article reviews the characteristics of the within-trial Type I error rate and the unconditional across-trial Type I error rate which have frequently been examined in noninferiority trials. The conditional across-trial Type I error rate is also briefly discussed. In noninferiority trials comparing a new treatment with an active control without a placebo arm, it is argued that the within-trial Type I error rate should be controlled in order to obtain approval of the new treatment from the regulatory agencies. I hope that this article can help readers understand the difference between two paradigms employed in noninferiority trials.","inCitations":["308580b5d229d9f5012fb062239df3ac2230a1a5"],"title":"Avoiding ambiguity with the Type I error rate in noninferiority trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2015.1052477"}

The Loewe additivity model is one of the best general reference models for evaluating drug interactions. Based on this model, synergy occurs when the interaction index is less than one, while antagonism occurs when interaction index is greater than one. We expanded the meaning of the interaction index, and propose a procedure to calculate the interaction index and its associated confidence interval under the assumption that the dose-effect curve for a single agent follows Chou and Talalay's median effect equation. In addition, we review four response surface models based on the Loewe additivity model using a single parameter to determine drug interactions. We describe each of these models in the context of Loewe additivity model and discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages. We also provide S-PLUS/R code for each approach to facilitate the implementation of these commonly used methods.","inCitations":["0fed2ce74e1d2794e4c92076d4d3285c6f9005be","a7b092c43d68c6e6a991fdcf041f1f625d716d34","bd6b4d0fd4e5ed8a8c620fdcc868e1c777f41ce1","7fd9544ed796dc72f6eb57d5ce529ed6be473790","6ad56d7465d0366681de41b6ad619bfdd3c17186","77698300cfcc4a2096b162521375de21520398fd","d1cd71808a86938b7970224fbc923efcee44444e","d21d3e8478a240721f968fbffe37c1b5a4afec78","af2cbfce8f676fa2dc25e8e463d6b8dcac88c579","0ae9dfc8133d92c6a9e2b681d92da7e095d30661","f60ff2f4070b205712ad3149a2d2a160b2364865","284f8bca3a9fad77040447f3411f087cb18ee4bb","005dbbfb89aeb950a788a71f98d335beef4d9bfe","516b280fcb1ddf9187566952dac414a1313942ea","e1fa74e75545058624b6d3089f95d6fadf3caad6","08479f7d6f8d3786309ea39036a479dbad0a6d8b","efcc1094499a895f1c1d1bd9a7b2bed3bded4e23","d704e72aafa1b57fdac862eeb2bdaacdd5ce7c20","afae41ccb25b43ebbb0d96c2badfb9d8dd01ce81","855e6b9f38845a33e2845cdaab1bfc925dd41242","27d2da103682d4cc000472e6bf4faa5ba32694e0","4322aaa971aba43a110a07e635191b68fb884920","b084b50b9b015dd2829149fb1aaa5b395b993dee","25a9ef082b61e19ca9008cb4def05865eab069e5","dd9c9f394b7f4acfc44603f4ddae20e0b7a60879","fcb31e46a9fe092ea9491777560f80ac4b03d3b7","352c21c74404dd37f01d2ba77cb159d039394a72","b51bf2e219620742a825f34d67432e5684ced6ff","cf72152fdb95bc8ba8cc1818a889ade21b6272e8","2c4df65cd7310d8e00274eacf013c6aecaee5e63","d86ab5688bbfe9fd0b95ef506ae9ded179f88862","a4feccbdad4e9e6197763451c1a14da1e8cf7192","02951b3f805a76e6b32708e2b5ba696e5660344c","41a2c56fc2d0ba503aaf3fb5b402fb96f9af7748","63a689cc4fc48bb2aad4964c92691e7959a9dcb9","541183aa073f17f147face916d842bda87b6c5bf","537d516bd885791e5e1d966a09db882d87002dc5","5af71acd89b24a7f3b5020090dd253b4815f8af2","69dbe2b30aa1f111c66075d3982c3447695944fa","ec9ec3b9974239d4fb195af79373966a2b8d72c5","bfb9fbdab6d0f7b14623cf942658cdc7386a0977","71f703cbe0d061f7db9387aa806bf3c3835217bf","6638d69459158ffa90b49a0be5f028ee697e0f94","cdfe3017f25044344c613e60d3257541879f65da","07d3f8e4ee82aa5010c78f1895499611fd3665a9","ea6768c4d2aeabc73084b1293e7b199462b8c3c4","2dede1e9207e682d8fe87598d4d5b2a7acb4d094","86b3dac5bc62eadbb2965ddbf636bdb9eda6a17a","7d11daec2b5f4898ec4ace641c55b5ce64542be9","ca8cdaa933c53e2e6127b12a1cbd1f0ad3b3e367","454196dc5a55d7a94cc60adc531434cc3b39ea78","4ec81cf00bb87a6badad7c54d89fc77ad584de6b","b3db63ecc86ca7a1fdd1e6dbc459204168f923cb","0087e9cd35db72e506d37999c6cca770b76149bc","0c32bdb16cbed226644f4abd985b609e74d2d5f2","3236699a920b8332bbc09082d371f875255aa987","13fe9c645b82107d9aa0e9ec3700e49357d1f407","48645b6dcd9ddc5235149a927d212bd17cf57762","796a6bdbb69cb46724ee2c7231dcb7fc7a311942","0468427d950388fd5949facfe07270339c1071d5","3f4843a06c030ea71d8ceae2b6f26736fc7c7979","475e935d73c2c9c8a3cb77e63f999cf174064ac8","2b0aacefac592ac02d9a0cb4199ff9ac90370061","b264354e0f6eae9953e1d741221c837f08fa8023","08a37f1aba2b8553707718c3f417c71ac9131e47","1394e437fabc9fedd8d2febcf4a962b59721f88f","03069ae3f209d28cd03ebeaaa91cc845dc3868d0","30ac9c6dc29477dc9bfa7b39a00fa00c34486cae","3c442902612589f0f41505806d5ba14d5e12df98","e6cd54fee24c770a9c8ec3590fccd0c688b44bd1","48a2b898ac8d5715e969b2733f38e154b91b7601","9481a8f1bc0f844384703cf25efe4417e4499dc6","c015be27349aee25794c97199d3325462747ebca"],"title":"Interaction index and different methods for determining drug interaction in combination therapy.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701199593"}

The proposed method presumes that the target of inference is the marginal distribution of the response at each occasion and its dependence on covariates, and can accommodate both monotone and non-monotone missingness. The approach involves a marginally specified pattern-mixture model that directly parameterizes both the marginal means at each occasion and the dependence of each response on indicators of nonresponse pattern. This formulation readily incorporates a variety of nonresponse processes assumed within a sensitivity analysis. Once identifying restrictions have been made, estimation of model parameters proceeds via solution to a set of modified generalized estimating equations. The proposed method provides an alternative to standard selection and pattern-mixture modeling frameworks, while featuring certain advantages of each. The paper concludes with application of the method to data from a contraceptive clinical trial with substantial dropout.","inCitations":["de88a34628e6e018199eb4cfa20f6053875c3af4","981462e00044114cc500545846dfce151bf99d3a","2fb66e509f1739766ac2ae71b9c96c1e20ddca76","8bcf9f4fa623b1ecd784d0a9e13cb02184912a7c","505e35fa98787bc4dad061ac0dfe25aa8ebb3a2b","cb9e9d151f5a85e903e041ab1456f29e51fc7fb0","8e6332a776c15412fca8a186e641b8ffc4510344"],"title":"A marginalized pattern-mixture model for longitudinal binary data when nonresponse depends on unobserved responses.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl010"}

To begin, we show that AEs are always subject to competing risks. That is, the occurrence of a certain AE may be precluded by occurrence of the main time-to-event outcome or by occurrence of another (fatal) AE. This has raised concerns on 'informative' censoring. We show that, in general, neither simple proportions nor Kaplan-Meier estimates of AE occurrence should be used, but common survival techniques for hazards that censor the competing event are still valid, but incomplete analyses. They must be complemented by an analogous analysis of the competing event for inference on the cumulative AE probability. The commonly used incidence rate (or incidence density) is a valid estimator of the AE hazard assuming it to be time constant. An estimator of the cumulative AE probability can be derived if the incidence rate of AE is combined with an estimator of the competing hazard. We discuss less restrictive analyses using non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches. We first consider time-to-first-AE analyses and then briefly discuss how they can be extended to the analysis of recurrent AEs. We will give a practical presentation with illustration of the methods by a simple example.

Three-way symmetry is a common assumption for triadic distance models. In the present study three-way symmetry is not assumed. Triadic distance models are presented for the analysis of asymmetric three-way proximity data that result in a simultaneous representation of symmetry and asymmetry in a low-dimensional configuration. An iterative majorization algorithm is developed for obtaining the coordinates and the representation of the asymmetry. The models are illustrated by an example using longitudinal categorical data.","inCitations":["8c72875e4b89deae4df80aa4d42bae5288114955","b3ad9f19e5d9010cadfa86a42f50c96e2fc8f64a","dfbfdd03077a85e2728caeb2f44d425dbff0f6a9","e3eeff18bee95b86b3b03568ad11f41b6763d138","a695d0cb355c6cb313e4862ba7b10a6e10bc1c73","9ceb17ba093ce26e8085cf66697b427a6659eb5e"],"title":"Triadic distance models for the analysis of asymmetric three-way proximity data.","doi":"10.1348/000711000159204"}
