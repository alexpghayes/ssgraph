When more than one polytomous variable is involved in an analysis, observations are classified in a contingency table, and a commonly used statistic for describing the association between two variables is the polychoric correlation. This paper investigates the estimation of the polychoric correlation when the data set consists of misclassified observations. Two approaches for estimating the polychoric correlation have been developed. One assumes that the probabilities in relation to misclassification are known, and the other uses a double sampling scheme to obtain information on misclassification. A parameter estimation procedure is developed, and statistical properties for the estimates are discussed. The practicability and applicability of the proposed approaches are illustrated by analysing data sets that are based on real and generated data. Excel programmes with visual basic for application (VBA) have been developed to compute the estimate of the polychoric correlation and its standard error. The use of the structural equation modelling programme Mx to find parameter estimates in the double sampling scheme is discussed.","inCitations":["a2955ae88cc8b30f54790e9d03780a9b60ca5f25","56be1e2f15cf8ffcfb6e5b5616b3cfca6d5da77c","66926e92e09cc1dc40fadc7c9a7168970d8d19ee"],"title":"Estimating the polychoric correlation from misclassified data.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X131136"}

One of the proposed likelihood-based methods is the Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model. To compare the performance of LOCF and MMRM approaches in analyzing incomplete data, two extensive simulation studies are conducted, and the empirical bias and Type I error rates associated with estimators and tests of treatment effects under three missing data paradigms are evaluated. The simulation studies demonstrate that LOCF analysis can lead to substantial biases in estimators of treatment effects and can greatly inflate Type I error rates of the statistical tests, whereas MMRM analysis on the available data leads to estimators with comparatively small bias, and controls Type I error rates at a nominal level in the presence of missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR) and some possibility of missing not at random (MNAR) data. In a sensitivity analysis of 48 clinical trial datasets obtained from 25 New Drug Applications (NDA) submissions of neurological and psychiatric drug products, MMRM analysis appears to be a superior approach in controlling Type I error rates and minimizing biases, as compared to LOCF ANCOVA analysis. In the exploratory analyses of the datasets, no clear evidence of the presence of MNAR missingness is found.","inCitations":["e8b02e631308428fa97500e09b6fb2ead9e8ee11","c400e38cafae97f9f56ecbeda3e95c9c69f63287","4fcfa6c086ee6a2b74ff1127237386d58c42f37d","f8ca6971005d8095c091552ae1cb5eaba83a3a24","da82fdbbe1db5a7994ee42f31a0e318bfd682c85","8c94a4cb0fb78d68133b6fad032e5bfff5b90782","9c9471ecee32d943a290d376d29c0e011b4e96a7","b5950339ab07ef2a132b48f02670e1b503f68826","9c796389f508afabebdd8d5e8ecc8f9129879f9f","057d8b525a5fd90bc218cbe8b6802b2e8d8d56da","352fc5095e54e8e1a6214dd225a3cdd074407bbf","d595dfa8ae7ef566bdbc7164ec246011a75c11d8","d254b7ee7bbd2f85e6c641148e76fe57c4b192a0","0ba1eee7fdbe4b389f4a115f75832616c0dbac7a","bd6c4aeba8d186f4dfb8b9de25e0983d8fe696b6","5034eac0940e29f0463a5bbddbbd4fc86044cfe8","9660c5d3fdaf0417edee8b0b91f19b1b9136475d","a028a043e20dc9d566e21be5db52307beb35e7f0","9a549fc8811b2ff629a5bc4d6486419be91a84ca","9f850e56962c928eb19ae12dc26f37320beb6f4d","5e2c8680604f4c026aa752ebd861a80e024711cf","225e592f6029af6e6aae2bb9699334bd70c5ba43","475c7b1b3061dc08cc92d261a0169bb14292e078","4af8e6ff4e19bdbab5efafe134fbd6b525329371","b7c2835c7b75d1973b6cd615b9b4c904da47a857","9b766c44fbd68069d998a29f1063e86237efca2c","5323e59baa6ec611b1d15deb3aa9af03a79de17e","07720da71660ee2da112102fee3b6c37932726fa","7c665175b668e67867cdee39fb7cec2ef37827ba","0d5b9f8f99454c94fc4ad0e05e1866512bf7538c","c10ff052ee625ff9b437a2e46e02b7f4e3889794","894a0c79cadaabea2899f3d33d4c499d73565d3a","2eff63b8fd7e6dc09fd3631e83d0453e2fe404e3","8f423555448ca2040a25a8db3f9878ac2521f458","df4763680872905c6189d1ff5368c4567bf15c61","9a3898bbaffce5e77f6a7cb57969786196227d27","022ca311850824612eb104bedb2df0c9fe5ee804","f67fecd7b55cc333bd50bd5c4364e3f5b7762f77","bda33f328b42299d44aa7fb278c6e49e253944e8","583b11843ac88d77a7a50d4c6f92aeac8de69263","76f6a826cabaeeb68dd3112fbcbd86463de670d1","6923784029604e57bfa76ab457cdb61135d2cd74","c60ca4151cd29d0777d49babb66a1b9b6019b625","ecc15fe4e02f6e1f5535d9e38ac8a813d1fa4cf4","05b3dfc0923b23d5cdd6c6968622f875e022be03","f8c8c819bf3237597aa160964e69d5da71f05609","b32c7dc416e1bec01dea39850a4037490ea65118","2585dccf288d6eb2dddcfcd0a48f0207f33f5751","0fd0920a29fdd04a3c6eab8200608217de2d2d5a","cac03b2910998f4fa543c9d7d042440107f40c8f","aa160c132be45fad3f734a7fe32e44daf5d70aee","4bb9542c2f3028c2906a7c93be8a7e32f0220fb2","c6d3bcc6e6709891c2d72551e325460ed9b4c51c","507eefabb29458bb0579c3657bcd4b8e0d2e9593","afaf786e8c4fb059b20d13dc7001fdc7cb606063","0c07188d6f182f100d82a521522de08727b96862","61de5e8b134817af049e82cb0c7432027c90d761","a9ee61f2f775599b585f9aa872dd321dcc60d4ef","107204e9a312f3a44f07db023140958d895b0d0f","4c1062abb5d288b106255819c5f75309714e4d43","34e5c242514edc59853140edb0be8b1fd8860b05","014d7ae8c5b785e574d068a649df40f06703a372","f888a7d308de7275f6ab9bd27e1cbd50f5bbbf33","80af7bd0e442627c83fbbdc0bd277e71b143e2e0","ea9752227c627e94ad3a18154b90d209729e1d15","d53d1eeb9b9a609638eba261cbe7f99ddbf40644","0a65c2bdc10b67a685b3ba3edf67de5694e6fd5b","e17530ad700dce78becc62e24796e177970e0a0c","d83a47a2914dd5a2dd0276db6d452022e65d8cee","d8029241a1c9995b9c374b813fd1f724b8bfacb7","d1bbcf79b24d7ecbd3b596bb5c2ffd383f169e2b","275f582997cd8cc42241affc8abcfa29cc396924","8002b94ca81a6d01fb054f27860daff7614fd306","ba40f6e3e16df8de34e678c00fe120f1edcdeda2","708bfe11d4a56b520cffc03104af69cfcff7e07b","9eacf4260482a4f8e3ad0e530a1831a84ad14f02","b2afac41cff1557745f68b75ea116752b2a1350d","5d8b615a75944055e2a73aef01176059a0eeed9a","93c5e7bd6ea1fc8d6a85f6a313ec64dfe9d961fd","ae1fe57c387b2a51136c8bd00bfbc1dc769b352f","b8c13507cdb20031adae6a06273e25b9babcd875","64ee5037ded95576d844a64e16b793c10c291f8e","3c1e04905393a286ed69b1769472bf9eacb9e533","b3853728d2fd7500f1f9c28123e2b012e07a9a2e","4ffeb1de59300172965e07530c9f5217a88379b6","2d61221e75aaa1478e2530dc096ece823b5a3507","080edee15e0df27ff61b92d2cf5d8d77afa4dc34","fea9dfa46edfa409995df5242b0eecb1d129a619","657634ab857ac07d77418f930790de6b4e02f6dc","4d69d6832fe4d8569dacbc845da1591b9c8a4cbb","537bb31a9cbbf4d1541e79bed696b2f1353a69c0","42ecef75be7749d792fd7061e20dc1d326ac033d","5e9ce68926f033fe52163f1bfd0ff72069ff0820","a255a18f003cfd3760e01eb2e3e3cbbd96f5a06b","b380a04c384639fc6931ac67dbd40730a64f4cf0","70a0650752f1fe9048bc4c245607c1c1eec600c2","3c99959ab28a70e1ff615c33a3dd0e38ed30aa95","f333d80d949b633c659bdc5d0e47f4a126aa96b8","f3a10857800b57bc360007835e25dcb32363b9a2","b34760594b1f6f092d98f6c893a52ced77dcc145","4d3ec5e306cc9226f0fa473d0c962a3741c5ae0b","05dc104d08b90b3208eb9f5d31e593d04e2ebdaf","5f0a7dcac18c9990437aff4060f36c48f3cb55e0","a56652a62980b891856e10137efedb62d55d1909","a6ad877b99016bab0adcd243521c7c3319f0ec0d","2e7b6bfaf5dae982b0a64f705a48ddbaf415037f","1899d955e2b45fa89610b5b12bc8ea6061c8ed79","0b3653ec0eee84bf69d915519b4dd5f6f705daf6","9e73a8fa65232d200a86739a41f396272d79fb1f","d6c7c18d9fed014e436c379b578f2d9c38de684d","ef68875180ec18b3fae6335ee084cce356ef3efc","d3269a4d8da9bf79320f403968608c7f2a2ea877","0d3448a03027a3afbdfd73597f0da938035303ef","ba220e584813dd76c3db2e36c1762b736b49eb5b","bbc6923c80f4744d25de20078428635d85a60ee1","c3e9ced587903f9bd500bbabfed741c

In recent years it has been realized that EM algorithm is a special case of the more general minorization-maximization (MM) principle. Both algorithms creates a surrogate function in the first (E or M) step that is maximized in the second M step. This two step process always drives the objective function uphill and is iterated until the parameters converge. The two algorithms differ in the way the surrogate function is constructed. The expectation step of the EM algorithm relies on calculating conditional expectations, while the minorization step of the MM algorithm builds on crafty use of inequalities. For many problems, EM and MM derivations yield the same algorithm. This expository note walks through the construction of both algorithms for estimating the parameters of the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution. This particular case is of interest because EM and MM derivations lead to two different algorithms with completely distinct operating characteristics. The EM algorithm converges fast but involves solving a nontrivial maximization problem in the M step. In contrast the MM updates are extremely simple but converge slowly. An EM-MM hybrid algorithm is derived which shows faster convergence than the MM algorithm in certain parameter regimes. The local convergence rates of the three algorithms are studied theoretically from the unifying MM point of view and also compared on numerical examples.","inCitations":["cee436c4a33bfb43ccc475f9f0068cd8e74149ee","5a31cc560fbe9319489c845712192fad1ccc22ce","973b3cad69207a60eed0ba9db1cfa767330132ff","1d1664ebb1879bd72e50ed58fd0b762ad8a2738f","fdffff8c1bf5cdd258f287136e0bbcd8ab0b7529","90add57e9d79c3f403d0875409d5e60b3bf1351b","ca7e78d8001d83e235907c3b3db19ce3627e644b","7852347a4a36ce8d934be4c24cf6aafd4032b214","2f9a2bc172446057faeda91618c1a7b39e1eafa3"],"title":"EM vs MM: A case study","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2012.05.018"}

Traditionally, the best treatment is estimated in a phase II trial. Then in an independent phase III trial, superiority of this treatment, estimated as best in the first trial, is to be shown against the control treatment by a size alpha test. In this paper we investigate a competing adaptive two-stage test procedure for a seamless phase II/III trial. We assume that the variance is unknown and include therefore the calculation of the total sample size based on the first-stage-variance estimation. We derive formulae for the expected number of patients. These formulae depend on the unknown variance only, not on the other unknown parameters. Using a prior for the unknown variance, we can determine the two-stage test procedure of size alpha and power 1 - beta that is optimal in that it needs a minimal number of observations. The results are illustrated by a numerical example that indicates the superiority of the adaptive procedure over the traditional approach.","inCitations":["41b40c56f69b571e481571c042396cf687ba775c","99806178a7e89a4ce7e18fa6faaed43bf471edd8","a1ae03d61b3a89a1c30898b80ee7878b0835169b","c169cdee05c64028f409eec475ae84cee79ae776"],"title":"A seamless phase II/III design with sample-size re-estimation.","doi":"10.1080/10543400902963193"}

This article proposes the method of matching weights (MWs) as an analog to one-to-one pair matching without replacement on the PS with a caliper. Compared with pair matching, the proposed method offers more efficient estimation, more accurate variance calculation, better balance, and simpler asymptotic analysis. A statistical test for the misspecification of the PS model is proposed for balance checking purposes. An augmented version of the MW estimator is developed that has the double robust property, that is, the estimator is consistent, if either the outcome model or the PS model is correct. The proposed method is studied in simulations and illustrated through a real data example.","inCitations":["8d19635c86977ca55f2863ee1d4acab06498a961","3b73f1d6003c76d16768e6e7127586ebc53d80ae","66388fed7c574e6105d869da3703d44c00ad70c7","856e5aea41ea550ed6c577291856d4557b30b633","0a544668259e38979e66ef2ac71116c70d853485","75eb2f592ad7aea069659bf8cdf8cd30ab6ce23a","f0c0ce53b1fc8a8220ac0b9a49d1fbdc0072168f","71d7781883c8c5cd208b462e974ed0a2d9db871f","c171e66df5414c311789cdd1f6cebb74d91a4c39","e7a8451d2ca37ed273886d1af543aad96a599bf1","b4977a4bca5cd2eaf00b4d612c20cdd7a23cae8a","ff765354dc9bd5bb6b01e1afa82cf4a84e5ae6a7","ef08af025c2f66e8f014171488c05772493fa105","23483c539d213058dc181675c5b76f8bb7be0c6b","397f11364e142b0e7869d8e4d258895b246906d9","b5db8373ec15e06e2dea549e0de1e3fb8873b17e","a3ea85a535513d6839704ad0c6bb8b119fceb9a5","3e611dc5041ed96e2fb9bdc0473f52ee2ee085ea","47d4c58fe8c89a516abdb3d254786ab05f12bb76","344e0e68960c76c451296dc64cdc4b15b1976334","881ef1257727192ea2edf2e49f951d6989bb308c","887a2a96af95cdd4f9897c95ded93389705ba55d","d8a0d49f82f8772404f304dd60982a82a5a74336","3448a64a0c9389eef6c494916c782ff886560384","4ead5b36e6a4f07c9e9b9ea7a37296b6857da2ee","3c053ee34da70c71d0429f0ea604e4eb7fa28ad7","174deafd2d9338d99009db5b55f1c6d1cc3fb4bf","ef92171898e5701432a92d4fa4292b0ea04488b2","932abe1f7680ace43486f6c31ac1127b603a1885","5a7ce80311848f747203634a933230f2cbe9fe5f","a34465bd67e7388d27ccde96c1b9973827ade57d","6eb2deadabe73d083edac333421dfc1f2bcf03f5","60279c355d569d9381f871e9917e9c7dd64cfe92","a55adcd1e599ae564a31dc2a7f1dc96937723fd0","2492c5a2c571568f0c5fe8572c00dc6445d7ddce","f217e44d5c197a8ada510bdf5681d6ebe03b4803","d367fc83d95a8b5d60a2289871ed96755b4f970d","0c432d0378fc2e51b727d4183bee05729d141375","a0cf9049fd58aead65d188cdb91f0d786251542f","3fd9e5bc61e84254612966367a65e27f296ff4f0","54352ed19883c4c224aed501781dc188796e198c","cbf862a44b0ac4f999e502425c042ce9f94f0943","c1fde7cfbd229e85e49b02f16eecc19b90056dc3","1bf1223c53065251285e2e843f72411511518a61","3dda09003d822f2ec07e2d82ffd48c97c61452b0","c93b68fd11f2a1acf2198c4ad1dbc30b659247c6","8b36088fbe43f731c9d8afb7b8c5f67e536a6566","555b0da5c5c85ad372eccd04ce62b5737f318481","923181f074894638dba11dc1715a5953b7888d09","b1bfab1f236004d9fc4fee96ea8992c1e11a8e87","5f87473d6a5ee89c0c1a0d1ebc7b77888f554f1f","eb5db1c5a84b4cd39e35a54189c48a02bd46913d","8bd1c666355f8c5b7ad6b12be6f3cc443ef649a7","7c3cf0224bb002f181e52a7d9a7a4f70ab7e9a91"],"title":"A Weighting Analogue to Pair Matching in Propensity Score Analysis","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2012-0030"}

The purpose of this research is to discuss the use of the noncentrality parameter delta of an F distribution as a means of testing for the consistency of treatment effects across centers. We state the testing problem as H0: (delta > delta 0) versus H1: (delta < or = delta 0), where delta 0 is prespecified, so that H0 represents inconsistency and H1 consistency. Thus, strong evidence from the sample data is required in order to conclude that the treatment effects are consistent across centers. We discuss reasonable choices for delta 0 and develop the alpha-level, uniformly most powerful and unbiased test, which is equivalent to rejecting H0 if the 100(1 - alpha)% uniformly most accurate and unbiased upper confidence limit for delta is less than or equal to delta 0. We examine other tests based on upper confidence limits, such as those calculated from linear estimators of delta and those calculated from a likelihood approach. We investigate the performance of the tests in a small simulation study and present an example from a four-center clinical trial.","inCitations":["4941abec1bca7d8686407e72dda8cae38428628b","4e78abb03cc51bc75315ee89f3edb177c36756c4"],"title":"Testing for consistency in a single multicenter trial.","doi":"10.1080/10543409108835006"}

The expanded model is a common Emax model with a power (Hill) parameter applied to dose and the ED50 parameter. The model will be evaluated following a strategy proposed by Bretz et al. (2005). The sigmoid Emax model is used to create several contrasts that have high power to detect an increasing trend from placebo. Alpha level for the hypothesis of no dose-response is controlled using multiple comparison methods applied to the p-values obtained from the contrasts. Subsequent to establishing drug activity, Bayesian methods are used to estimate the dose-response curve from the sparse dosing design. Bayesian estimation applied to the sigmoid model represents uncertainty in model selection that is missed when a single simpler model is selected from a collection of non-nested models. The goal is to base model selection on substantive knowledge and broad experience with dose-response relationships rather than criteria selected to ensure convergence of estimators. Bayesian estimation also addresses deficiencies in confidence intervals and tests derived from asymptotic-based maximum likelihood estimation when some parameters are poorly determined, which is typical for data from common dose-response designs.","inCitations":["15e67b39a49eb417b5e7bd84cf42f20e34123595","dfbb3b913413e068c5e05e9587e5d227944c7be1","e7901f2e1aa720b2d8fbd88a21ca20298a8961f0","d72e0dd284a93a5ff945a191bf796b8a90fe914a","01eb641410c20ae47f1a83a1660fef439c1c8626","f870e8bce596e6737ddd5f1dc9d435ea25fabfda","f7b0a7eddc27f1b7184d635bf9397c84b860f58e","4f7799302bf09633fab0f8999ab9d5e122702224","a1d13391a6cc4b7fc30012bc11c4a9621376e230","dc17509a897b3dfe62731527caf6b461d5a23246","f9d8f0c9eeb4572c03f6315a0b46b97c33251b50","9a8211d314f0f6d77c83e9134178846622898a88","66c920cb296f41769620f03adc25639394ed2c16","a953796d04406e7f2b0f16dad1647276fe20eca7"],"title":"Hypothesis testing and Bayesian estimation using a sigmoid Emax model applied to sparse dose-response designs.","doi":"10.1080/10543400600860469"}

In particular, zero-inflated versions of parametric count distributions have been used to model excessive zeros that are often present in these assays. Perhaps, the most common count distribution which has been used for analyzing such data is the Poisson distribution. However, a Poisson distribution, having a single underlying parameter, cannot cope with any other data dispersion pattern besides equidispersion. A negative binomial distribution is capable of modeling overdispersed, but not underdispersed data. However, a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution (Conway, R. W., and Maxwell, W. L., 1962) can handle not only overdispersion but also underdispersion. We show with an illustrative data set on next generation sequencing of maize hybrids that both underdispersion and overdispersion can be present in genetic data. Furthermore, if count data consists of clustered observations, one of the most efficient statistical technique is to introduce a cluster specific random effect term. Once again, the maize hybrids data presents such a situation. We develop inference procedures for a zero-inflated CMP regression that incorporates a cluster specific random effect term. Unlike, the Gaussian models, the underlying likelihood is computationally challenging. We use a numerical approximation via a Gaussian quadrature to circumvent this issues. A test for checking zero-inflation has also been developed in our setting. Finite sample properties of our estimators and test have been investigated by extensive simulations. Finally, the statistical methodology has been applied to analyze the maize data mentioned before.","inCitations":["abda729e2561650f69edadd1df83f541deba08f0","fbbee8268b61d747f8cee00fa5be9a8138db9b58"],"title":"Analyzing clustered count data with a cluster specific random effect zero-inflated Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2017.1312299"}

Sequential testing involves selecting a sequence of tests, but only administering subsequent tests dependent on results of previous tests. This research provides guidance to choosing between single tests or the believe the positive (BP) and believe the negative (BN) sequential testing strategies, using accuracy (as measured by the Youden Index) as the primary determinant. Approximately 75% of the parameter combinations examined resulted in either BP or BN being recommended based on a higher accuracy at the optimal point. In about half of the scenarios BP was preferred, and the other half, BN, with the choice often a function of the value of the ratio of standard deviations of those without and with disease (b). Large values of b for the first test of the sequence tended to be associated with preference for BN as opposed to BP, while small values of b appear to favor BP. When there was no preference between sequences and/or single tests based on the Youden Index, cost of the sequence was considered. In this case, disease prevalence plays a large role in the selection of strategies, with lower values favoring BN and sometimes higher values favoring BP. The cost threshold for the sequential strategy to be preferred over a single, more accurate test, was often quite high. It appears that while sequential strategies most often increase diagnostic accuracy over a single test, sequential strategies are not always preferred.","inCitations":["ee8cb0caaebbe5b721a8f2bfcc412c6a5ae8eb2c"],"title":"Choosing between the BP and BN sequential strategies.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1945"}

Historical control data, however, often have a small sample size, are collected from a different patient population, or use a different response assessment method, so that a direct comparison between a historical control and an experimental therapy may be severely biased. Randomized Phase II trials entering patients prospectively to both experimental and control arms have been proposed to avoid any bias in such cases. The small sample sizes for typical Phase II clinical trials imply that the use of exact statistical methods for their design and analysis is appropriate. In this article, we propose two-stage randomized Phase II trials based on Fisher's exact test, which does not require specification of the response probability of the control arm for testing. Through numerical studies, we observe that the proposed method controls the type I error accurately and maintains a high power. If we specify the response probabilities of the two arms under the alternative hypothesis, we can identify good randomized Phase II trial designs by adopting the Simon's minimax and optimal design concepts that were developed for single-arm Phase II trials.","inCitations":["2ad297e8ddf847ce1ef309a3ea04642642f7add5","d8c8276aeb74160156200ffbcca6a297b95a624d","ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb","a926f6c1a3d20745fa0dccd14da78f83202711f7","f9d4d7096f616075802c9fdf957e90f3b6bb001f","488db2294daa01b92f5a34e81c8f1b5026eb0281","5324e756867cf1585744bd1569af6c397f468d52","c06f46ac090cc82537d181bcc14e40c18feb7e3a","094f5d4578522d93d6495acbc724d353f6138b31","419e77c2b2de224707cd8b3a3d4340f06b257717","a1169845865c72bb3a0d7c9dcd52da6493cb2dae","f40d686d61e60302e8a69ecd5c185c45dcc6dfe6","c46f7a6ca5f8e322ee8f61773f8c4fc6afa51e7f","75921a732a21702acf58c6ff0574ffaeffc1a46d","66e59aae89b61a0e6d07760338da31f753721e68","1b44389bb502fb4393364405bcb6a8a4e9157da5","ea03b54b825513dbbcee9b8e4e5199b552f3697d","5a018123ddfa258f7805e7be03546e55d424b33e","dc818fa1e47c8f6fcf5b6b18db42a9e6f39925a6","bc4cafb1562c2962c94027a2e5b99b2f8476e862","646ca11922662aac5ab9736951c813bd2b28ff18","c037a13c21d275e49493ec0a91d6faab450c1bf5"],"title":"Randomized phase II clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.901343"}

Computational statistics","paperAbstract":"In dynamic mode, positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to track the evolution of injected radio-labelled molecules in living tissue. This is a powerful diagnostic imaging technique that provides a unique opportunity to probe the status of healthy and pathological tissue by examining how it processes substrates. The spatial aspect of PET is well established in the computational statistics literature. This article focuses on its temporal aspect. The interpretation of PET time-course data is complicated because the measured signal is a combination of vascular delivery and tissue retention effects. If the arterial time-course is known, the tissue time-course can typically be expressed in terms of a linear convolution between the arterial time-course and the tissue residue. In statistical terms, the residue function is essentially a survival function - a familiar life-time data construct. Kinetic analysis of PET data is concerned with estimation of the residue and associated functionals such as flow, flux, volume of distribution and transit time summaries. This review emphasises a nonparametric approach to the estimation of the residue based on a piecewise linear form. Rapid implementation of this by quadratic programming is described. The approach provides a reference for statistical assessment of widely used one- and two-compartmental model forms. We illustrate the method with data from two of the most well-established PET radiotracers, (15)O-H(2)O and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, used for assessment of blood perfusion and glucose metabolism respectively. The presentation illustrates the use of two open-source tools, AMIDE and R, for PET scan manipulation and model inference.","inCitations":["5911ce9616fff91a1454b201e0c23103692b1858","72a27a095face48bbb67aa76261a133cbe06c494","bbc8cb34e3f374705c7b6d5b39a3a72c8d674324","196d9c8f3e140044f2faccd51289e3f0334470c0","60bbcc96f034577c1c78f6cbfede59924b9fa735","05f5d7ae954cbf939afb73700c958076edd548a4"],"title":"Kinetic Analysis of Dynamic Positron Emission Tomography Data using Open-Source Image Processing and Statistical Inference Tools.","doi":"10.1002/wics.1196"}
