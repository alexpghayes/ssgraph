Several proposals to generalize this result are discussed. The exact density is extended to the estimating equation (EE) approach and the nonlinear regression with an arbitrary number of linear parameters and one intrinsically nonlinear parameter. For a very special nonlinear regression model, the derived density coincides with the distribution of the ratio of two normally distributed random variables previously obtained by Fieller (1932), unlike other approximations previously suggested by other authors. Approximations to the density of the EE estimators are discussed in the multivariate case. Numerical complications associated with the nonlinear least squares are illustrated, such as nonexistence and/or multiple solutions, as major factors contributing to poor density approximation. The nonlinear Markov-Gauss theorem is formulated based on the near exact EE density approximation.","inCitations":["61824b483b23642a642348b0a9151cb843598749"],"title":"Exact and Approximate Statistical Inference for Nonlinear Regression and the Estimating Equation Approach.","doi":"10.1111/sjos.12269"}

In the motivating Genetic and Inflammatory Markers of Sepsis (GenIMS) study, it was of interest to determine how several biomarkers subject to detection limits were related to survival for patients entering the hospital with community acquired pneumonia. While survival times were recorded for all individuals in the study, the primary endpoint of interest was the binary event of 90-day survival, and no patients were lost to follow-up prior to 90 days. In order to use all of the available survival information, we propose a two-part regression model where the probability of surviving to 90 days is modeled using logistic regression and the survival distribution for those experiencing the event prior to this time is modeled with a truncated accelerated failure time model. We assume a series of mixture of normal regression models to model the joint distribution of the censored biomarkers. To estimate the parameters in this model, we suggest a Monte Carlo EM algorithm where multiple imputations are generated for the censored covariates in order to estimate the expectation in the E-step and then weighted maximization is applied to the observed and imputed data in the M-step. We conduct simulations to assess the proposed model and maximization method, and we analyze the GenIMS data set.","inCitations":["e21571bb8845e24f55abd1d5750d1d6f52d9ce89"],"title":"Maximum Likelihood Estimation in a Semicontinuous Survival Model with Covariates Subject to Detection Limits","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2017-0058"}

Graphics cards, containing multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), are self-contained parallel computational devices that can be housed in conventional desktop and laptop computers and can be thought of as prototypes of the next generation of many-core processors. For certain classes of population-based Monte Carlo algorithms they offer massively parallel simulation, with the added advantage over conventional distributed multi-core processors that they are cheap, easily accessible, easy to maintain, easy to code, dedicated local devices with low power consumption. On a canonical set of stochastic simulation examples including population-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and Sequential Monte Carlo methods, we nd speedups from 35 to 500 fold over conventional single-threaded computer code. Our findings suggest that GPUs have the potential to facilitate the growth of statistical modelling into complex data rich domains through the availability of cheap and accessible many-core computation. We believe the speedup we observe should motivate wider use of parallelizable simulation methods and greater methodological attention to their design.","inCitations":["0f01cb971efd7bc3b5a8a2226511ca36848fec55","cfe746d382495683b11ae55a48b011173a0c9de1","2b82d434a7096f67f97d54c73f869686d0f0df18","0eef26c7801822efa9cd5fb17471f993f2972085","c6b0fe359b32bd737b1c822ef10aecc66d669a88","1ce6e00a7ea7179320f39f1368bf9d2a141721ea","a6013b289f97020c4b4c0f3c385302b067b6640f","73a0197766b4a5ac4070ee2752823626e01ac6be","c96c5fde81628d976a3c2afdbec72543d3afbaf3","f061e925e862c694365f4678727a34efe68b9bce","be2eab5b8af815fb3b1c4bf9f9557b070b144c25","c339b288be75018f55214147e2980cdaafef9979","d131a2213bccc2178460fb80de10aa9e62247ce2","f6c805eba9ab1fcc41ab36dea814edbac1b06d6b","5be8dbd329f80f1179b527bc0e73be66956562e3","6dd1609d780375cf4d2e27a6500edacc06527a42","1166692f314cfe0d2cca202fc03f5f0e54f516ac","1a16e09cf14c4146300213db32e07fd74f87d811","6d992a228ee3240ec0395ea76b7801d0b2c3d93c","5d827e4c02884e737bbc2f6720df57dbeb4f92cd","3edbd45ba51682fc8efb99e9e4d34b4725c8f256","5379a8716bc795cc27b0d8c511733370dec4f987","72fcbb83432ba984e42447c28a1e192fde4582f6","d39531b4f455b66356bf50abb81673576b48212f","27d696ff09117c4c6e0d1a3f3045a3ab5186ff5b","46276f53b94f346abff071b024b199c3e55547e3","6fe96e7bc981731e0ed71204e3a77e0ef206d8be","15a1cc3fbf62e80adebffc8451d2dac8ef578754","41347ad6a744dc0cbe98a3005d08bd8caadf08a1","23eb00810c2331d196d48ba8abdeefc6f4bb4cff","88bb964360b8c88959c317dab86c5cc5d0180628","a5c0942287af9457ae058b1e46eda1253b8fae39","69aef29ccee7a1800b66e4ad2c71013070bcfc5f","8f7d798680faf200b425fd11dfd1f1db2163d075","ae5d2badcae00667ff56fe1e21d243b84a7407be","55d85b9b173ad13bc2b2a56a5fc98a679f7753f5","9bdf73fc2fa0ecc669c2f199ad8bda6fdf84c441","b6760bcba3c11ff6774e9be16adfcbe6be312bdb","a57a07852b82ca8121a5f037cbebe1f7a852e044","2302262fcf5b0e5fd2ce6ebb59e1c536e8919569","afc1c9a96886b2d294a53af2186b6a62262dfbb2","1dd56cb411a292121604016672302a9a99653dc7","ecb45e928ab6e4b222a4512bb7b952cb6e0ac801","a3130f3b3d1604b7547c1ef0cd5a7e157c0f1070","7f36875530cebdb1efdabf4b27e64dfa7cae84cb","625c8e642b76c239755c7dce3bb711c8900dc295","6a9ad61f0b32f1caa91e7b8e51d380df47ec1aab","c46c8115c9b689da1f977439d2cef0f844aba1f4","1948d5fc67636c17bdc95b6c559b4eef8300da20","c047c23610109d41b2c1ce8ff4dd8e29beafd241","1fe0900ec08df5b21b37d46b35da6a3da3824b50","5e2cb188767a24bcb005cf2308f3723c7c9a66ca","0c8ffbf47893d241d5a7940b7e3edc2d0ad9d3fe","9386ed54aba167a251886ec18e2eb2b36aeecfc6","a006720fab2e173f65f99c225aee6edc97c8b0eb","3824f1ac7c45e1278ae119421d14e19de0ab67c1","26fd561a8cf57a0063de82dd0887e6ece3728a22","c62359d8382fc971a301993ad2d30d6cdc909e68","a1c3e301bfdec367b6c2b3d869e71e3214de7bda","55a1fb0287127cb7cd0aee3edbf870382f3cf9c4","89aa2e98c4a998af1d2ffaed9f02fb0306da213b","ba1ce9886db8b2d7d4fa5e00eec015a14f67908b","45b626720c1c38a78ac39447c570e9be47b05566","4f67452ca508248e5f3e48290c071a3822025eba","8a11d31d23b900c8252152c9b0a7be81e1d943d5","380329eae4bca4c5370b7449e040468355dc2b2e","ca7914b6f19ee9fe5776784214dfa8233bd7f163","468c0ffb71af46fad8971eba9bd602b3f2624ad8","83ba0844292ac7acaf3df213e9e863e506f68994","bfc3fe8484bf3ea63dfaf4a3b9ff0855ac1253c1","dd870cd1c48c9aa5737cfcf31e28aee6ec1cde7f","e3755ba47c5dcc84692b258729b6fd7a9652722b","0bff90f4bb25f9f3e4245bb8728c165eec660f88","a209a329e7d893ba55974da0802433c6c03f6f2a","e7dae93d9c4419f99d9cd89a9e7ca89facdde815","8af6af47c70b2a6c4ef901d5f7d45c415011c8b3","813ab5b99152d466e19770430564e50e9a20b1c0","dae76dc15e6b7d4ca8608f8f568c492d0bc7631f","38f6c9b482dc69722d3959aed772708103f565bd","3656ddded7e870cd2c3c273b8e8ada56d47118c0","60a54851ca8381180482c20fd5d30afe19359f69","f54b958148a5cd53817312e5c4c5e2560857a623","b4379b525618e795d0d08c412040818f7473a946","9192b349f6f4b5d818eff437a8a2f110f103d5ed","61c7d76822406bc9445caa723f82e93511379b9b","7769836d0cde07acb9e61f3d5dd9a5b7392fbffc","e88a8825684bd3e539d9083295fe628ff892adcd","8279b96312350eef09ac7c7dfbd59d9f4e499250","3083fe29e94371ccfe34e936fd783f542fc0342f","8c13a59b545ca799eda3212273e3bb2b2ba8697b","71ebec1a3e6292a1cf570b97ee8ec3003c3a52fb","bfab1fc055add782b80bb884e77024486063ed7a","402cafdcc87734c88c395293fbab0006adc8c10d","77fc73480852694a930a54f7648707680314f1dd","8da92750f52b56f49710e68d523a669b4409b054","34a0fda0ba08b04c9bb72e0b4cbdde94393f5bb3","91bf4b8c33498ac4dd05095e5b8c6919e7c3acd1","ce7b372345b8604ed01596e22827ce8439d39ded","6050da4fe7221d5113ea71f527b800af60df4be3","dff89f0662bcfb499aa54c62e1ef28cd71164712","d9f8a90651476802f3399c199cfa822cca672f91","c27e7470bb492baf74c543497a600860e2e6a828","15675f053d3a3fa8e3621f3f9fcd3cde97708965","bf9ce41b4b9a68e22b54b710876d8102eed780d7","d296f0c981e6ee00f5cda216b1f856e79949e7f8","81ee2b9e5894240e49a7847ad3c495be6b267de5","d05d865b5eaf4ad2ff5d168e6907fcf13e95346d","576786771c0a9321f5582fd17268c376dcb47105","149094c6efc8c8d7ce072cbbd15e904e0b9c1614","eafc3b3296997136b3f701a7b135a52fb1a6f397","3bae3bc71203d0f3d151d5eabb40e1f652ba3643","a51b7c2f5c7607d4f1f49c03af283b15ad73c50d","f66eaa74b9e4dc1da9e6864a2ac359e2216ecb0c","02feb847c89f2b7a1f52fea7b9044120063cdb09","a4bd48b3c512a9a8f829ab9bc53ac79075f84d4e","d240db857919de77465b94e2d9eb11

In this modeling framework, one assumes that the effect of each of the covariates is nonparametric and additive. However, in practice, often there is prior information available about the shape of the regression functions, possibly from pilot studies or exploratory analysis. In this paper, we consider such situations and propose an estimation procedure where the prior information is used as a parametric guide to fit the additive model. Specifically, we first posit a parametric family for each of the regression functions using the prior information (parametric guides). After removing these parametric trends, we then estimate the remainder of the nonparametric functions using a nonparametric generalized additive model, and form the final estimates by adding back the parametric trend. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the estimates and show that when a good guide is chosen, the asymptotic variance of the estimates can be reduced significantly while keeping the asymptotic variance same as the unguided estimator. We observe the performance of our method via a simulation study and demonstrate our method by applying to a real data set on mergers and acquisitions.","inCitations":["799ecb0db4c9ed7932382b1a38b3630e0a56c5d0","ccf72633f8a37bbf6c4fbe187bdd0a442d367ec7"],"title":"Parametrically Guided Generalized Additive Models with Application to Mergers and Acquisitions Data.","doi":"10.1080/10485252.2012.735233"}

Based on case-control data, the article describes a latent variable model designed to infer the etiology distribution for the population of cases, and for an individual case given her measurements. We assume each observation is drawn from a mixture model for which each component represents one disease class. The model conisidered here addresses a major limitation of the traditional latent class approach by taking account of residual dependence among multivariate binary outcomes given disease class, hence reducing estimation bias, retaining efficiency and offering more valid inference. Such \"local dependence\" on each subject is induced in the model by nesting latent subclasses within each disease class. Measurement precision and covariation can be estimated using the control sample for whom the class is known. In a Bayesian framework, we use stick-breaking priors on the subclass indicators for model-averaged inference across different numbers of subclasses. Assessment of model fit and individual diagnosis are done using posterior samples drawn by Gibbs sampling. We demonstrate the utility of the method on simulated and on the motivating PERCH data.","inCitations":["7ac832bc44749fd1dcaa1233166909329f403bf8","ebdbb6d5229e9f64eb5cecb11a9fb2168e5043e3","2baabb737154aee83e8915ee8da8a114a45cb1d4","f465a1b03d8dfa809ec033449d30f79c24621459","ba7fee5e6ecad786d58b738c840a71aea9335119","9ab788488afc6067242fc247be7333d0211a43e5","e16072734dff5a66dcdd1c147957daf02444f84d","8276d64861e070805d56b292163da25b0240253f","3bcf4f3caf79b3e2a3bd9768dc15257281f76514","51295064ddff468e17036f0e47c0352b7e8c9b37","d24c1b08533aa323e5ebb96351afba2cd32007a8","c085db1e66f6ea46c7fa4f3d1fe3109c15d9838f","f827217bcb7c9ab484c07dd18e1a2969b95e2b97","e7691f8c0aaee62a38a2c92e989ba1efb2e3da2f"],"title":"Nested partially latent class models for dependent binary data; estimating disease etiology.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw037"}

Typically, these maps are generated using count data aggregated over areas such as counties or census blocks. However, with the proliferation of geographic information systems and related databases, it is becoming easier to obtain exact spatial locations for the cancer cases and suitable control subjects. The use of such point data allows us to adjust for individual-level covariates, such as age and smoking status, when estimating the spatial variation in disease risk. Unfortunately, such covariate information is often subject to missingness. We propose a method for mapping cancer risk when covariates are not completely observed. We model these data using a logistic generalized additive model. Estimates of the linear and non-linear effects are obtained using a mixed effects model representation. We develop an EM algorithm to account for missing data and the random effects. Since the expectation step involves an intractable integral, we estimate the E-step with a Laplace approximation. This framework provides a general method for handling missing covariate values when fitting generalized additive models. We illustrate our method through an analysis of cancer incidence data from Cape Cod, Massachusetts. These analyses demonstrate that standard complete-case methods can yield biased estimates of the spatial variation of cancer risk.","inCitations":["8f16c769e17e913e7362628b843e04722713df93","ba8550d2d009a7626054afbf417ca64b6b15e58b","d812e9b3838d0d14faaabe888efccfbae14e851a","f1e6cd86b16d762f32aefa59165cea9040bc9f79","603223668dbddd26b5d3545bb004356caa0c1862","e59acda81c0c241500f2c4aee82595ba33e3197a","c4a404eb202be07d3f5ca7ef544686ee2d831f35","4f46f57ba2f650e22f1c950da721954f49314266","48a57c069bf2562700ef14abe9752a5ded4c710b","feaf019139fe5e1361733be70910074fb133a9ae","65d1c281fee0a5c90cc0efee10e8dc23835c14b1","d2eb504e8fbe802ab388ce17c2176148eb8b3bf2","76601090aa51e5d165ea9fafc9de141d5fc6f562","e8c491e32402cbbba31dfc05b697448aec9caf9a","316ae5e5cd47719efa9771596e16da3e5cdea135","4a48cd2d5878f6eee4de498015bc6a2df4b3734a","81a1722919dbef26b4661595486d30f659768cd7","555afdc6f0fd2d373e07cc92d5fc9a12080252d2","d95de2279adb993ac58f636376098cc76e86d0b6","48efeccd9288fbe5ff81c8f0d0b695bfb8e2cd03","cb91d771f74615d193875bdcaab5f8d697b099b9","4d0b3532a7d36535125878e52d68fb983de547e0","d56587af35d6db73ce58498e7709ed3b428f8fcc","ef30abca45c7d5b31385068f7ae0946222723540","cd6f9889739e5176862ac8fb6038008b73bc9c61"],"title":"Generalized additive models for cancer mapping with incomplete covariates.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/5.2.177"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2007,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"Pharmaceutical statistics","paperAbstract":"In large-scale genomics experiments involving thousands of statistical tests, such as association scans and microarray expression experiments, a key question is: Which of the L tests represent true associations (TAs)? The traditional way to control false findings is via individual adjustments. In the presence of multiple TAs, p-value combination methods offer certain advantages. Both Fisher's and Lancaster's combination methods use an inverse gamma transformation. We identify the relation of the shape parameter of that distribution to the implicit threshold value; p-values below that threshold are favored by the inverse gamma method (GM). We explore this feature to improve power over Fisher's method when L is large and the number of TAs is moderate. However, the improvement in power provided by combination methods is at the expense of a weaker claim made upon rejection of the null hypothesis - that there are some TAs among the L tests. Thus, GM remains a global test. To allow a stronger claim about a subset of p-values that is smaller than L, we investigate two methods with an explicit truncation: the rank truncated product method (RTP) that combines the first K-ordered p-values, and the truncated product method (TPM) that combines p-values that are smaller than a specified threshold. We conclude that TPM allows claims to be made about subsets of p-values, while the claim of the RTP is, like GM, more appropriately about all L tests. GM gives somewhat higher power than TPM, RTP, Fisher, and Simes methods across a range of simulations.","inCitations":["2fd27fd27b91a62520369e6e28159cb93af585e8","a0c7f2bae43f795805cd093a6b25506c61889f09","f6baf27615afee306d0bfa4e91f949281ab9a88f","c7ae7c27433527b2e55dd5e53c8887970a09cd8e","1eb911e04d90764c83c0534a708966630ee02f6c","474ae7ffff09fddc2683786c9df58b3da1b8c02a","cddf87d75bef4b32bce91c16260bf274fb01d434","4bfc2a533ae84a39b9b6f5ed83acd4964ce64b25","cedcda987a36bc11a74650111660763c74cb73d2","70f0c9192c7258297149df82cc2c719b02946384","efff319e6d675f170ea0f7b80534bedb534358a2","dd891ec64ca78166ef7c166ea11673667a8e50da","8ae3f5ed026656e62d10e45e240671a9ff0cf7ce","95854baeacaed5b9294f7dc39a1991e7b26055c9","816ee97ba97818c77b731f43008d820df93b6af0","aed02d81e509eaa623279cd84c818dbd81faed5d","a3224c192a9cbd6d4f7f1a491a96948eed9d485b","0548892affb3e3ec14291287bc9daf5b87273432","929ef8f43a29119b2a9b678552645bcf3f9faa62","03ab5d5c4b18d6756b856f136eb7099f16b68c23","ac35a113fff8c4131c60cf85158e9fae366df64f","fe39fe58c250a5a9b959a5258a3a3d31965ada67","558cbcc63deebeea095e6123a5a7ba1738d391d8","e30b1a710c602bff8c2deab8b08e03ca57f6c39d","51005d109edca4e3819f7df363bc3cfa245348fa","47afc721f9441c2f997d954dd4b571622d12de08","716ed0717475e97b73f56a84dae632f999885083","8e6f24c304aa3446e63c5f160acc1e32ff64e42f","0f3c0249c9ed05544ca778ddf08577226c562bfc","dea3a3f63c1d4a95ba15a2c3bab3760fd4d06c18","2190c8ccb61e329fb08a2e8e5d5caabfd364f3b2","7970ba220b52192c912f3cfd98a08a235b77950e","ba39393e541875d50baa7e75eac38bf069d929ba","3f7e6380af8d50349d7e7ca30fe83ba2f0708433","56337aed7cf8888b98406c9d78f5627329a58829","a740982a0835ccfbe32db2eeee344ae8c63684a5","31599dd445bb4ed5039bc12d58d653ac5e37e28a","44189ef84b4d1e89187804854e3d77525292f267","bfaaab1796c8a33fbafb3beef88ca90350fd7406","ed7b48439dd1e61cb376ef576cf8403c0c361254","d023a1efd0869b68290b43d9fb12846dbfef72a4","0a2ba257cb181e76ba0f44c0cfd3cb96e5fa387c","6a1d1b7c2efdebba9ed7026162b14039757e6ac3","aa13ca8c399ee131ecb98518cddc4c9ad497c3fe","b76967ab57cf1494c03ca5300c1b09d2eb5cb4ea","94fa6678777daab9e54abb8d0dccf001969d368b"],"title":"Combining p-values in large-scale genomics experiments.","doi":"10.1002/pst.304"}

We describe the exact distribution of Cook's statistic for a GLUM with Gaussian predictors and response. We also present computational forms, simple approximations, and asymptotic results. A simulation supports the accuracy of the results. The methods allow accurate evaluation of a single value or the maximum value from a regression analysis. The approximations work well for a single value, but less well for the maximum. In contrast, the cut-point suggested by Cook provides widely varying tail probabilities. As with all diagnostics, the data analyst must use scientific judgment in deciding how to treat highlighted observations.","inCitations":["98386545682e496cd565b62de3533833d0cc9ea6","02231705f66048e29f2d69b7c4f45ccda2e2ffc6","fff42c69297411de904c7fc5af0605f8b8ec8a15","98d876159a36c087b14b02a2cbe2c9cd6499fa90","dc2f82aceb62d9ffbf43f93740aee5532069514e"],"title":"The Distribution of Cook's D Statistic.","doi":"10.1080/03610927708831932"}

Compromising in the face of this computational burden by partitioning the dataset into more tractable sizes results in stratified analyses, removed from the context that justified the initial data collection. In a Bayesian framework, these stratified analyses generate intermediate realizations, often compared using point estimates that fail to account for the variability within and correlation between the distributions these realizations approximate. However, although the initial concession to stratify generally precludes the more sensible analysis using a single joint hierarchical model, we can circumvent this outcome and capitalize on the intermediate realizations by extending the dynamic iterative reweighting MCMC algorithm. In doing so, we reuse the available realizations by reweighting them with importance weights, recycling them into a now tractable joint hierarchical model. We apply this technique to intermediate realizations generated from stratified analyses of 687 influenza A genomes spanning 13 years allowing us to revisit hypotheses regarding the evolutionary history of influenza within a hierarchical statistical framework.","inCitations":["1452b3235ba148afc760e59604262200a29675c9","e25e0c8906aaf23ca5cc8db9acefa7738ba316a8","2cf8dc481bab6124e25c8e3b166e7023cdaf2934","d05d865b5eaf4ad2ff5d168e6907fcf13e95346d","3d2011a4148fcb26945bde5fd8d2919ce99d07ff","4af4a6b2125a664428fb3fdd0b2b72f2eeb78de8","7be498188a6e7585f79b0c729e5a4f12551d29cf","969836027407d8dbabd3b1753a579d53eca6a4a6","4a36a1ac8db26da3a21f232ca1719d3bce20adf8","2bc0fd71b88fd68b09ce5f8ecc6df7717c8e50de"],"title":"Reuse, Recycle, Reweigh: Combating Influenza through Efficient Sequential Bayesian Computation for Massive Data.","doi":"10.1214/10-AOAS349"}

In contrast with previous developments, this algorithm uses closed-form expressions at the E-step, as opposed to Monte Carlo simulation. These expressions rely on formulas for the mean and variance of a truncated multinormal distribution, and can be computed using available software. This leads to an improvement in the speed of computation of up to an order of magnitude. A wide class of mixed effects models is considered, including the Laird-Ware model, and extensions to different structures for the variance components, heteroscedastic and autocorrelated errors, and multilevel models. We apply the methodology to two case studies from our own biostatistical practice, involving the analysis of longitudinal HIV viral load in two recent AIDS studies. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the R package lmec.

Consequently, the classical test statistic that is used to assess statistical significance (i.e., the analysis of variance F test) typically provides invalid results (e.g., too many Type I errors, reduced power). For this reason, there has been considerable interest in finding a test statistic that is appropriate under conditions of non-normality and variance heterogeneity. Previously recommended procedures for analysing such data include the James test, the Welch test applied either to the usual least squares estimators of central tendency and variability, or the Welch test with robust estimators (i.e., trimmed means and Winsorized variances). A new statistic proposed by Krishnamoorthy, Lu, and Mathew, intended to deal with heterogeneous variances, though not non-normality, uses a parametric bootstrap procedure. In their investigation of the parametric bootstrap test, the authors examined its operating characteristics under limited conditions and did not compare it to the Welch test based on robust estimators. Thus, we investigated how the parametric bootstrap procedure and a modified parametric bootstrap procedure based on trimmed means perform relative to previously recommended procedures when data are non-normal and heterogeneous. The results indicated that the tests based on trimmed means offer the best Type I error control and power when variances are unequal and at least some of the distribution shapes are non-normal.","inCitations":["a3f7dc66a4941657406479550e02cc0eef4b03c9","b64a5cb1b4dd8e56bb1adfd66b550e28307637b3","756aeab81871ad74ea257aa0f6f7d695ef6fc61b","52cb2ba167be9e79550ad150465f49763bcc77e1","f9dc07026bc49b1b380c8f244b138628de181be1","7710b767003b99a024763e00debfc01ca7452ae2","2297dd8fcbf375c3d044b017c32608dfe3729035","a4a8443f85718d3935108f6d027dc8a5914ba68e","70a271d04cb2e11c21daf94d1f5a30723a8ad9e8","ded520fa7d5ad9098f3dcf0674332a22548a4e69","658846ea44536ba6bd8786d3d3502c2acee2517a","4092b78b99ccf3c14d2e096b608a618bbb904b93","56fd25b69b3c30b19291e2367afd1e7d70076f91","e33b89299f40b36813bdbd69ac150de1fb2d5b4b","d387810322747cf93042c8ddb33b0afa2fb7974d","4d2d4e33f63a7a6b89c717102ee7d027795b85f4","9977229a7fb07c72785b26ffa5c0aaeb9c54b413"],"title":"Effect of non-normality on test statistics for one-way independent groups designs.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02014.x"}

Extensive simulations showed that the proposed test and sample size formula perform very well under different scenarios.","inCitations":["00dfe4673debbcc480edeaa0be9357112917b8dd"],"title":"Single-arm phase II trial design under parametric cure models.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1678"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2009,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"Recently, a number of model selection heuristics (i.e. DIFFIT, CORCONDIA, the numerical convex hull based heuristic) have been proposed for choosing among Parafac and/or Tucker3 solutions of different complexity for a given three-way three-mode data set. Such heuristics are often validated by means of extensive simulation studies. However, these simulation studies are unrealistic in that it is assumed that the variance in real three-way data can be split into two parts: structural variance, due to a true underlying Parafac or Tucker3 model of low complexity, and random noise. In this paper, we start from the much more reasonable assumption that the variance in any real three-way data set is due to three different sources: (1) a strong Parafac or Tucker3 structure of low complexity, accounting for a considerable amount of variance, (2) a weak Tucker3 structure, capturing less prominent data aspects, and (3) random noise. As such, Parafac and Tucker3 simulation studies are run in which the data are generated by adding a weak Tucker3 structure to a strong Parafac or Tucker3 one and perturbing the resulting data with random noise. The design of these studies is based on the reanalysis of real data sets. In these studies, the performance of the numerical convex hull based model selection method is evaluated with respect to its capability of discriminating strong from weak underlying structures. The results show that in about two-thirds of the simulated cases, the hull heuristic yields a model of the same complexity as the strong underlying structure and thus succeeds in disentangling strong and weak underlying structures. In the vast majority of the remaining third, this heuristic selects a solution that combines the strong structure and (part of) the weak structure.","inCitations":["6cd762e7cb1301abd0ddbb265dd9c7661ffc0458","6b44f1b9c05d27b7c095d4948393ff2b092bf3fe","8fbe2c554d30fd32471aad4bd98acb34f6023232","3f0f9bb373de82e6c6a56ac60a6b0e11be6e0996","c179dae462f8d6c4beaee66e38f04a9827c32a55","f1b450554a97643a4e2a5b1df1019c6a3b99a6f6","267993a133bb14a7848d670dd878dbe70f26abfa","779e661c7a02829c69f68996705c0177f7849494","8a312c546ee220c1eddb322218e24a2484a8f51d","29f399ebcb314c7bb801c43a86b1590f0acefe89","93717fdf3bab3723ca14acb3f8c8a42f110fb33d","d9ef8b5f178bee44f394b8c00d3e10ebfebf89a8","fcf04d6cfc6902e7213bfc087230a4ce1d7e57c8","86cfa6062b8048015403d1b1ffca1508d854c60e","a4e23a533c2a9cd96302a9a6b23bea65edb81a77","85ea076e5114c4309d1f1fe6cb0a386397c72390","fe61e500a1ef718dc475ff4e6b08c0d44d256e26","fc21369b13f258de69cdfa09a82f3e0c22093e34","3de0e80837eb30963a5d008b4a7767b13a343a05","ca75e67a88e7b53e2347c7298a942aa9d8a23705"],"title":"Discriminating between strong and weak structures in three-mode principal component analysis.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X369474"}

As a result, an adaptive seamless Phase II/III trial design consisting of two phases, namely a learning phase and a confirmatory phase, is commonly considered in pharmaceutical development. In some cases, however, the study endpoints for the two separate studies may be different due to long treatment duration. In this case, test statistics for the final analysis based on the combined data are necessary developed. In this paper, a test statistic utilizing data collected from both phases is proposed assuming that there is a well established relationship between the two different study endpoints. Formula for sample size calculation based on the proposed test statistic is derived.

However, the categorical nature of some scales makes these techniques inapplicable in the way they were originally defined. In this work, we show a possible extension of this methodology to the setting in which one of the scales is an ordinal categorical variable. When psychiatric health measurements are either developed or used in a new population, reliability and validity must be investigated. Reliability, more specifically internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and inter-rater reliability, is focused on the reproducibility of the measurement. Validity is defined as the degree to which the scale measures what it purports to measure. This can be performed through the analysis of content, construct, and criterion validity. We argue that recent methodology, in particular developed to study surrogate endpoints, can be used to examine criterion validity, concurrent validity, and predictive validity. In concurrent validity, we correlate the measurement with a criterion measure, both of which are given at the same time. In predictive validity, the criterion will not be available to some point in time in the future. The surrogate methods were applied on pooled data from five trials in schizophrenia.","inCitations":["0fcd673694828130059d67a3a99a152d431a774e","ce1e8d1fa7bc877330cc5f5456671c744dff0ed3","b2cf4ef5b4fabc28ca4638fe3a0853e78b59a6cf","f76d3b019b552fde34d1c2043b254dd7ce8176f5","7a2c23d079fd211147f43de19c36c2814710da7a","9bbe7ca2e5a2d2f2cc70dd67c93a4508abc888c8","564ea8cf766deaf936f2c9e88d79461677332cbd","75ad859b04adb042920005818ba4428b14682597","27e38f9448d1f4fb61a6fe0dc054f3682a73968a","b26e240162230cd54c88791faea70a9342f145aa","64ce841e81efa5122110c42af73b721a51006933","625dd6ee723e28c01a279ad20d471f32a7f571ad","d683ad5005946782f6ae9573d747d81c713a3623","1771197e8ef2e440b4a81672639d0728b9ea220c","85350f0bb92581cd87c3d7da5b5422343da57646","712993dd7ab6b505034bce119f0c44d1e179cc07"],"title":"Investigating the criterion validity of psychiatric symptom scales using surrogate marker validation methodology.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120015741"}

The convergence rate of the joint distribution of the first and second stage test statistics to the limiting distribution is studied, and design parameters are provided for a variety of assumed alternatives. The behavior of the test is also examined in the presence of ties, and the proposed designs are illustrated through application in the planning of a hypercholesterolemia clinical trial. The minimax and optimal two-stage procedures are shown to be preferable as compared with the one-stage procedure because of the associated reduction in expected sample size for given error constraints.","inCitations":["51c9870b230bc99d9781ca9c12416f53d1c75376","50e3274159c330fb1c6e264fd50eb48b6b25f518","abe391e57f174d636aaaae7a90d65714af04419b","f2ce2228b8a30569e201e4c4bf7bb6ee9657a841","93fedfc3fd8e7006fcefb5cf58ca60b8a4a2fabd","bf75135fce5cf7097f0b78239789fc32a1e9de4e","30f8322db599404ea9c5672625ec08b4c84c6bdd"],"title":"Two-stage k-sample designs for the ordered alternative problem.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1499"}

To determine if genetic measures are associated with trajectories of lung function as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC), children in the primary cohort study retrospectively had candidate loci evaluated. Given participant burden and constraints on financial resources, it is often desirable to target a sub-sample for ascertainment of costly measures. Methods that can leverage the longitudinal outcome on the full cohort to selectively measure informative individuals have been promising, but have been restricted in their use to analysis of the targeted sub-sample. In this paper we detail two multiple imputation analysis strategies that exploit outcome and partially observed covariate data on the non-sampled subjects, and we characterize alternative design and analysis combinations that could be used for future studies of pulmonary function and other outcomes. Candidate predictor (e.g. IL10 cytokine polymorphisms) associations obtained from targeted sampling designs can be estimated with very high efficiency compared to standard designs. Further, even though multiple imputation can dramatically improve estimation efficiency for covariates available on all subjects (e.g., gender and baseline age), only modest efficiency gains were observed in parameters associated with predictors that are exclusive to the targeted sample. Our results suggest that future studies of longitudinal trajectories can be efficiently conducted by use of outcome-dependent designs and associated full cohort analysis.","inCitations":["b44ca1d8c3ffb37ad65c2f80b2bbfa8c15876e46","3a59bb107fc705f1d06f7299fb1f6cb2fd67e486","f512e4da7c62eae45117884369de020e802fb754","622242129abb444bc3c69bdff5cdb06558e5e0a3","f92f5ec14d15933a940a8786c8267846e6f35e48","7efd60c6b7458d6087d062e25b06f6ead84b4c2c"],"title":"Biased Sampling Designs to Improve Research Efficiency: Factors Influencing Pulmonary Function over Time in Children with Asthma.","doi":"10.1214/15-AOAS826"}

In the study of cancer, multistate cure models can be used to identify factors related to the rate of cancer recurrence, the rate of death before and after recurrence, and the probability of being cured by initial treatment. However, the previous method for fitting multistate cure models requires substantial custom programming, making these valuable models less accessible to analysts. In this article, we present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for fitting the multistate cure model using maximum likelihood. The proposed algorithm makes use of a weighted likelihood representation allowing it to be easily implemented with standard software and can incorporate either parametric or non-parametric baseline hazards for the state transition rates. A common complicating feature in cancer studies is that the follow-up times for recurrence and death may differ. Additionally, we may have missingness in the covariates. We propose a Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm for fitting the multistate cure model in the presence of covariate missingness and/or unequal follow-up of the two outcomes, we describe a novel approach for obtaining standard errors, and we provide some software. Simulations demonstrate good algorithmic performance as long as the modeling assumptions are sufficiently restrictive. We apply the proposed algorithm to a study of recurrence and death in patients with head and neck cancer.","inCitations":["067043c390c16040aeadf2293032408621956f34"],"title":"EM algorithms for fitting multistate cure models.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy011"}

A longitudinal series of measurements is collected on each subject within each period. Dependence among such observations, within and between periods, will generally be fairly complex, requiring two levels of variance components, for the subjects and for the periods within subjects, and an autocorrelation within periods as well as a time-varying variance. Until now, the standard way in which this has been modeled is using a multivariate normal distribution. Here, we introduce procedures for simultaneously handling these various types of dependence in a wider class of distributions called the multivariate power exponential and Student t families. They can have the heavy tails required for handling the extreme observations that may occur in such contexts. We also consider various forms of serial dependence among the observations and find that they provide more improvement to our models than do the variance components. An integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (IOU) stochastic process fits much better to our data set than the conventional continuous first-order autoregression, CAR(1). We apply these models to a Phase I study of the drug, flosequinan, and its metabolite.","inCitations":["b0af1b4f01bc1eaf1abb8f5b3117009aef91b46b","960e2a2f24f9e5c5331064ab1640a785477483de","5e50680a2c3e6bcca24cc698de550327c31fa6c4","4526320dd1be5d52789953faa04419f2c620862f","1fad5140d338ca14af03f75e920c0832e95ea2f7","d375635a5eda2b2323ca0fb7652d984d81ce2e08","70242068e90428134fec650b9cc7c59bde72cd08","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08"],"title":"Modeling pharmacokinetic data using heavy-tailed multivariate distributions.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-100102500"}

Investigators can use latent group-based trajectory modeling to estimate the posterior probabilities that an individual will be classified into a particular group of risk patterns. Although this method is increasingly used in clinical research, there is currently no measure that can be used to determine whether an individual's group assignment has a high level of discrimination. In this study, we propose a discrimination index and provide confidence intervals of the probability of the assigned group for each individual. We also propose a modified form of entropy to measure discrimination. The two proposed measures were applied to assess the group assignments of the longitudinal patterns of conduct disorders among young adolescent girls.","inCitations":["ce428d5eabebb8e1bf9a6a8c407e9bb19f889810","fd665c72c6a65710ba2d0379db6028acfe269e5a","75099a581c5ee081c258a90612d4066ac2a246b5","7aad3cc07f36bb8e9cba99a22043a3183ea47b06"],"title":"Measures of discrimination for latent group-based trajectory models.","doi":"10.1080/02664763.2014.928849"}

Traditional frequentist quantile regression makes very minimal assumptions on the form of the error distribution and thus is able to accommodate nonnormal errors, which are common in many applications. However, inference for these models is challenging, particularly for clustered or censored data. A Bayesian approach enables exact inference and is well suited to incorporate clustered, missing, or censored data. In this paper, we propose a flexible Bayesian quantile regression model. We assume that the error distribution is an infinite mixture of Gaussian densities subject to a stochastic constraint that enables inference on the quantile of interest. This method outperforms the traditional frequentist method under a wide array of simulated data models. We extend the proposed approach to analyze clustered data. Here, we differentiate between and develop conditional and marginal models for clustered data. We apply our methods to analyze a multipatient apnea duration data set.","inCitations":["530bf21272b70bea68fbf7effe9d3f05d5152c3e","968577d2088408325bfcc647843c03019b4d2729","35a74d5c81df68b9923642551c740c6873117e52","ea7bbea573c5621972f8e2a646e6a34af37d8a12","59a530818b1a0e2707d721b33bc84770b9119e6d","12c43866baf5a34cf840af1c55a3aad1cfd76cc4","e248832b76e5dfd2c48ed196b8b9c5fc3dfec812","13003060861bde4cd7000692188a806b77e64fb4","1f37e0c041197b3b3649adb613653c328d37ab3a","4bf8687e152fae7190a820640a9a405bf500340e","bca3bc3708a657cc6775a649ba5e31837ba836a6","0117c4d428dbd39e2d4c688b82528a67bfd6d263","8d69a0a97d52e83f936d9f731b1ba93dd83b55a0","ff4d8d4fa9d240fd9a05389cde3557aa0f852bec","564072d587d5c48e9a30e2e7213f896278a51091","8a4adc7dfedccb745dd80dbcdf0d813a8ad1252d","8d940f40c2d45a6f6389cd779d1b66848bada640","af2e7ba7c4605c6c81bd706853540ceeb1fc42ba","5a6a608b7469a86cbadccd36b687e694415625c2","38a64d6a9a32177e93df67e619d0e499efefd6fa","7f0d7ff83bf5201332abcaba17c21c203325c210","928838b7c067d9e926da856409d63d093eb118a3","67e3afbda11ec163e00db6d261eb3278a2c6f440","26218ad3b4f6bd3a39d3e70d74f5730c4efde13a","70e714644e665123a18ae03e89189c590e9293d1","f2e16bf06054bf0451b00c0a0bf9e831ec9d3301","9198980b4ca7ef182e7414ed60c9b8046f9ced6b","e3b4d342145ccbf75b8c328f69cdcd6baa709347","b2b0ba964daabb3f6c7a647e665a22d11c443722","c1586b703cbbe8e24bc5414c74bb18a6be55c291","f62c806b177696e005683693c4374c00ca1e9785","0d0bb16017510d626af50065a7945fefba28a60d","d7296a2aec72bc75f923b6feb935bd06d60352f6","9bc2a838feb23fc4b5429679860c02b6afaaf533","b8dbff42594a6f344b8cc1d30209c3fb6085164a","b114cc254a85e3c4f1e150f9a1d32a74ef568b8b","7bb9c006161feca13f4359778788740db3add998","7602d07f906785f8207e1321f4be07845413493a","51146cf18fe8218dce683d8e67dc1aaaae034812","e24001d68cd700df4a74d5998d56a3363214a3ce","702944f2a50d6e9792700984fa00d38b33d6c549","2a66f14cd6f7d35c64716e72141d59a78932dd4f","0609a82298d94082851b2c5593c8e9a8e7cb5af3","e2367f02b528899ef1aeebaf8e2e23b44fd75cab","d46e7a891867e5f8c90fd99f90a1b6188de56341","da534a3d59743cd7e8bfee0ac6cdc2fd9e24450f","1173aa6ef5f1089a98fd5030f70cf61499a8c6bf","5bfecd1ed7f8291844779cb73dd950e08d0f9558","e1b448181feecef0e4120cc9351ab9d48ca34375","57c875f0f9eab0118c94dae4de2179f3e2bc9697","d11f6ed5626f28f5f3924c5ee23d79f15356e238","58a84d0b790aeac990f8526784ea8598f7747368","a8cdbd4e04f5bc92b552d6c6b810dcc8eb4a6cd8","dbf06e6579a868decc7d2e90125c0400ab09df62","e816f1af45f7f8fd45605ca39a8056c9a8d9b347","8f1be9c4a5aeae6c5f3c049e1e1e60de3e7d5b05","8b9118d5fbef9d4b4ca82adf5d0828aed04301b7","80bbe4b1d740f0f158c571d296897597abc107d9","972912c8e29179a038e30e9606ee051b71503d88"],"title":"Flexible Bayesian quantile regression for independent and clustered data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxp049"}

The calculated thyroid dose of a person i is expressed as Dimes = fiQimes/Mimes. Here, Qimes is the measured content of radioiodine in the thyroid gland of person i at time tmes, Mimes is the estimate of the thyroid mass, and fi is the normalizing multiplier. The Qi and Mi are measured with multiplicative errors ViQ and ViM, so that Qimes = QitrViQ (this is classical measurement error model) and Mitr = MimesViM (this is Berkson measurement error model). Here, Qitr is the true content of radioactivity in the thyroid gland, and Mitr is the true value of the thyroid mass. The error in fi is much smaller than the errors in (Qimes, Mimes) and ignored in the analysis. By means of Parametric Full Maximum Likelihood and Regression Calibration (under the assumption that the data set of true doses has lognormal distribution), Nonparametric Full Maximum Likelihood, Nonparametric Regression Calibration, and by properly tuned SIMEX method we study the influence of measurement errors in thyroid dose on the estimates of λ0 and EAR. The simulation study is presented based on a real sample from the epidemiological studies. The doses were reconstructed in the framework of the Ukrainian-American project on the investigation of Post-Chernobyl thyroid cancers in Ukraine, and the underlying subpolulation was artificially enlarged in order to increase the statistical power. The true risk parameters were given by the values to earlier epidemiological studies, and then the binary response was simulated according to the dose-response model.","inCitations":["83a699cdfceec02c9bf043a1db0eac6509955ee6","86fab5c778424ca505e09764892b6c6ac396f91a","2c961f91539f142671b880aa4941918a145b0b10","8c10d9d10bf3338743322decc0a3a9e106bef3c5","28b9f0d078b4c4eacc429121c1737ad4027495de","63ae53470d86b600a5679a20f3813130746a5696","76aef52d969ba565c3a90725ab4a31120f976b09","f233ee4a16c1851ad0ef8778779b5c538c04396a","fe7e895ef70ca4d9999d9fd3a372ce3e1178d04a","7dd1e1199b97d180f7a7626433fed091428300a1"],"title":"Methods for Estimation of Radiation Risk in Epidemiological Studies Accounting for Classical and Berkson Errors in Doses","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1281"}
