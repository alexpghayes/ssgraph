This problem is greatly compounded in hierarchical Bayesian settings, since these inversions need to take place at every iteration of the associated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. This paper offers an approach for modeling the spatial correlation at two separate scales. This reduces the computational problem to a collection of lower-dimensional inversions that remain feasible within the MCMC framework. The approach yields full posterior inference for the model parameters of interest, as well as the fitted spatial response surface itself. We illustrate the importance and applicability of our methods using a collection of dense point-referenced breast cancer data collected over the mostly rural northern part of the state of Minnesota. Substantively, we wish to discover whether women who live more than a 60-mile drive from the nearest radiation treatment facility tend to opt for mastectomy over breast conserving surgery (BCS, or \"lumpectomy\"), which is less disfiguring but requires 6 weeks of follow-up radiation therapy. Our hierarchical multiresolution approach resolves this question while still properly accounting for all sources of spatial association in the data.","inCitations":["6c51e6e29d973bc718ea2846a47bc5432c5c92c3","94e2216fe74fb468293a94430910423989a9c183","fb280f3c8e688d55235bf89ab344ccc97f23c3bb"],"title":"Hierarchical multiresolution approaches for dense point-level breast cancer treatment data","doi":"10.1016/j.csda.2007.09.011"}

A pivotal quantity of interest in such an analysis is the mediation proportion. A common method for estimating it, termed the “difference method”, compares estimates from models with and without the hypothesized mediator. However, rigorous methodology for estimation and statistical inference for this quantity has not previously been available. We formulated the problem for the Cox model and generalized linear models, and utilize a data duplication algorithm together with a generalized estimation equations approach for estimating the mediation proportion and its variance. We further considered the assumption that the same link function hold for the marginal and conditional models, a property which we term “g-linkability”. We show that our approach is valid whenever g-linkability holds, exactly or approximately, and present results from an extensive simulation study to explore finite sample properties. The methodology is illustrated by an analysis of pre-menopausal breast cancer incidence in the Nurses’ Health Study.

In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to fit a marginal structural Cox model directly, rather than the typical approach of using pooled logistic regression, using the weighted Cox proportional hazards function that has been implemented in standard software. To evaluate the performance of the marginal structural Cox model directly via inverse probability of treatment weighting, we conducted several simulation studies based on two data-generating models: one which replicates the simulations of Young et al. (2009) and an additional, more clinically plausible approach which mimics survival data with time-dependent confounders and time-varying treatment. Using the simulations, we illustrate the limitations of the conventional time-dependent Cox model and the MSM fitted via pooled logistic regression. Furthermore, we propose two novel normalized weights with the goal of reducing the MSM estimators' variability. The performance of the normalized weights is evaluated alongside the usual unstabilized and stabilized weights.","inCitations":["e22ff66105359b033de05f2468cd989906682773","d55cb85e7b9daabda788bc08973bd881c45852ce","8a1d4ad2489816700583d1490d9211e9ea6887c7","4a548d6bd892c79c80cc45b104086a050fb49d4f","a2ec6298127ee632b5ae6b967ac25def55fc8f08","5e7c4b544e5908b923e434e04a84a4df898686f1","b32f130cfe4e0daf5a6be97cac57cec14427b8f2","3426592c30dc50a893da1ce92a19b68ee6045cad","2f022e372e7b03245743277b38d5ff4a53419486","8e8b74f49b6cabde2ce36cf90653758d9186f1c6","71c1d801fdb812889a03662d59c3a31892e090c2","10034476ab37df6511759053d6e45b2d411d133a","ff690a56bff464fd9a39ef25012c60366032edb0","c69e8da5b6e78991144c4b76d4d4340d5528e8d6","539c34ac53ccaa05fcffbad93804964ff839c6a0","97e3517944a25b14c941d44b41b43c4c91c2f097","c7d422f0e6f5ad7ca3a2bcfab9abb0d74642efe5","4c3e85d7119c469f99476873bd0dc5cc476565da","7aae2292e7ea7c2571bcfc77a923b49623402fa5","db04675a2800334aa9dc3ca3d74e2009e0a2a8b2","4385ba945e21bc8de566afa687f9cc2874e204e8","314e9028d11e6f2880abbac858c5b9d2cd5d6b3e","1df2b4eaf2ec0c34d27303a3d6f41a07f8e71546","aa1a27d820c73f01422865a81a6f4496cdf07164","bb1ef2c4c4ebf3630f18b009bc01e6ac3bce925a","3804dc718e4b7b66126c6db7ca68cb9e73eb52da","e17c57b8973c25d9ed84312dccc4cf490e0ad14b","3b3a3a4ff2b84a7a3e37fd8ec971781dd49aecca","141559d4c042481178833270c08f7b42270e20f8","785c7be325114bf39f4abd28d07c45982be50da4","84e4a4d4e004975630b68353717ada98b7bba361","db8b32f6d62009fca8deb72370a31912c77c7775","0a478f518a22173b8c1a7ec0ae53ba3649ae2ea2","a61975016c539cefbc76fbf1608b74a305e6ca7b","8ba1234c0c067d816d546aca66c6af4903c44451","b05ffc2274d34b80086f10a168ad708057218151","e5a89d76ddfa39f748f9fb5cf07a5ee904abd791","00c0c89abc68ffd11d520488d7445398303e8b3b","47d05f12f4243f0eabfad6fe66add96810cbdb43"],"title":"Accuracy of Conventional and Marginal Structural Cox Model Estimators: A Simulation Study","doi":"10.2202/1557-4679.1208"}

We develop a latent class modeling approach for joint analysis of high-dimensional semicontinuous biomarker data and a binary disease outcome. To model the relationship between complex biomarker expression patterns and disease risk, we use latent risk classes to link the 2 modeling components. We characterize complex biomarker-specific differences through biomarker-specific random effects, so that different biomarkers can have different baseline (low-risk) values as well as different between-class differences. The proposed approach also accommodates data features that are common in environmental toxicology and other biomarker exposure data, including a large number of biomarkers, numerous zero values, and complex mean-variance relationship in the biomarkers levels. A Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation. Both the MCEM algorithm and model selection procedures are shown to work well in simulations and applications. In applying the proposed approach to an epidemiological study that examined the relationship between environmental polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and the risk of endometriosis, we identified a highly significant overall effect of PCB concentrations on the risk of endometriosis.","inCitations":["9047ee134766666d529f8090aeb71125f5e80bef","77298c6b8d96796ec7337f89d12b4d1c4a535849","74d7edfd3008984252d9b2cdba2c50a1d2f6c0e1","25cab74a962a672f2e67d05857c8ce6ed68474c8"],"title":"Latent class models for joint analysis of disease prevalence and high-dimensional semicontinuous biomarker data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr024"}

They are: (1) Retain the baselines as part of the outcome vector and make no assumptions about group differences in the mean response at baseline. (2) Retain the baselines as part of the outcome vector and assume the group means are equal at baseline. (3) Subtract the baselines from all of the remaining post-baseline responses, and analyze the differences from baseline. (4) Use the baselines as a covariate in the analysis of the post-baseline responses, assuming homogeneous regression slopes. (5) Use the baselines as a covariate in the analysis of the post-baseline responses, allowing different regression slopes. In this paper, we evaluate these five approaches in the presence of data missing at random. We evaluate the approaches based on the bias of the estimate and the coverage accuracy of the confidence interval. The results suggest that strategies 2 and 5 are recommended.","inCitations":["2d61221e75aaa1478e2530dc096ece823b5a3507","4af8e6ff4e19bdbab5efafe134fbd6b525329371","718c682dd05a1fe9741d72fc1a9e16fa6af629ab"],"title":"Handling baselines in repeated measures analyses with missing data at random.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2011.550113"}

Analysis of array-CGH data typically involves estimation of the underlying chromosome copy numbers from the log fluorescence ratios and segmenting the chromosome into regions with the same copy number at each location. We propose for the analysis of array-CGH data, a new stochastic segmentation model and an associated estimation procedure that has attractive statistical and computational properties. An important benefit of this Bayesian segmentation model is that it yields explicit formulas for posterior means, which can be used to estimate the signal directly without performing segmentation. Other quantities relating to the posterior distribution that are useful for providing confidence assessments of any given segmentation can also be estimated by using our method. We propose an approximation method whose computation time is linear in sequence length which makes our method practically applicable to the new higher density arrays. Simulation studies and applications to real array-CGH data illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach.","inCitations":["92471ef86de66e5c797628554ca52e87920c02c6","50b2ad6be0f56fb052e85b514fb51de7672c4ef9","b5e407a9b5bbd37eccb2ad11564cc4defa9e8a88","594b6136d5475cfa84391b60609dded1e7d36c05","238d58e733afad876b3a11bf170f26277e3701cc","d5be94b98276863b7116b364429776cc6266d3cf","56d3d99e3778b225ebd63aa9b53af58a93cd546f","5d2fa7ebdb61d83ae7954bb48b7f7d44dd16b7ad","6556a39b6a41fa2f285929720c36f79feae52538","be2312dee8bab6f7115ed62c84e8becc46f1ed62","7b928f5df67ac3fab334f2aa441cdf9a38da9e95","4892aeaa695c032ed4a39c814be109c9d31095cb","ab29a4431a3b6d60e8d884280a0469fc75911abc","6d8214ec65fb7b0918189eb39a1daf80a6bcf9c3","438dc46c48574e8526c27b18e128e947607e06f0","944cda1cdc0e9d8f2a8f41eede84069f8d5c64fc","d897c5c7021929ded970868c714db0569987ae59","e4f79923a305344ae97df8f1602e1b3489fdced1","4710637d62db175913dbd33b4d753e99a1f44f92","6e009c562f158cf610413b48696958ab155ca322","fdbd00990753f74f958ca244846eff9159b8a87a","88e3f256b3f62323e97985b46d1231310c61a49b","49e944b32090eb992d00257769f489a880449ef7","fd670481ff0275cf8f7a7b56aeb517f03f0e7f4c","d5735ce852e30964074eb0a79ad78b496f1e2e99","798839065832987ca5204d84f4f59bc80fca6842","0d778fd6b5284e27deb5e774a38d447681873e5f","dda2441b5274ab2787d74e852fcffa0f0e4da446","76dffb91ded2e401974aa1796585245466bbc9c7","b21e19365a7d073ce5e76071c6c9362398f4b828","d91901b953ec4185ab04502a4040f37c9139ccad","e5b356e0fe5f1a668cae76c749530812d3f7918a","184ff3bd1ba58f11089af0e8b5e1cf6156ec02d1","6d94c28b73c2e496f09acc749810cd8cccf2f68f","c6b3d31741e7e5f68072fd30ba2ce0c9c33e4dd1","4e56fb97bbf34f1f132d460c02b427f33149e2b1"],"title":"Stochastic segmentation models for array-based comparative genomic hybridization data analysis.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm031"}

The majority of the existing statistical methods, including those on haplotype analysis, assume that genotypes are missing at random-that is, at a given marker, different genotypes and different alleles are missing with the same probability. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that the violation of this assumption may lead to serious bias in haplotype frequency estimates and haplotype association analysis. We have proposed a general missing data model to simultaneously characterize missing data patterns across a set of two or more biallelic markers. We have proved that haplotype frequencies and missing data probabilities are identifiable if and only if there is linkage disequilibrium between these markers under the general missing data model. In this study, we extend our work to multi-allelic markers and observe a similar finding. Simulation studies on the analysis of haplotypes consisting of two markers illustrate that our proposed model can reduce the bias for haplotype frequency estimates due to incorrect assumptions on the missing data mechanism. Finally, we illustrate the utilities of our method through its application to a real data set from a study of scleroderma.","inCitations":["70d26e20e39e90dc010def4e2a1158a96c4bc250","7a1e24d61e6cdc68b8fd293fa7c6fcff8925a531"],"title":"Modeling Informatively Missing Genotypes in Haplotype Analysis.","doi":"10.1080/03610920802696588"}

We would like to determine whether there is an association between the two variables as they evolve over time. We might also want to predict the pattern for the primary outcome conditionally on a specific profile of clinical interest for the serial marker. A model is developed to address these issues. One regression model is created for the primary outcome while a second regression model is developed for the clinical marker. The vector autoregressive model, i.e., VAR(1), is used to characterize the covariance structure between the two sets of repeated observations. Hypotheses of interest are described and procedures for testing them are elaborated.

This kind of non-homogeneity is postulated to result from macroscopic behavioral tactics employed by almost all involved agents. A State-Space Based (SSB) mass event-history model is developed here to explore the potential existence of such macroscopic behaviors. By imposing an unobserved internal state-space variable into the system, each individual's event-history is made into a composition of a common state duration and an individual specific time to action. With the common state modeling of the macroscopic behavior, parametric statistical inferences are derived under the current-status data structure and conditional independence assumptions. Identifiability and computation related problems are also addressed. From the dynamic perspectives of system-wise heterogeneity, this SSB mass event-history model is shown to be very distinct from a random effect model via the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in a numerical experiment. Real data showing the mass invasion by two species of parasitic nematode into two species of host larvae are also analyzed. The analysis results not only are found coherent in the context of the biology of the nematode as a parasite, but also include new quantitative interpretations.","inCitations":["35f1a92d5bf2d89d6ada17b40e5db417d019d7c0","e1d898fd53b327a1ebf350a6346b1911db0e9412","cc6dbea30d0a5e9c7683947013964769dcf9ae99","2580b8cfbfc54de418f1b5eac3eb50d686d065ac","b54bc4d7f5c82bd9b02a157a72ac5e7af8fba330","a0310846628e04e743cb6a5a0462d81d0aa833eb","682de8b261a203fa7d6d55dbc38006ba2ce708e5","d1c6ac3e1650207cac1f0732b30e8a427ac31746","971bb522a966076daac140f5dcef18cb9ef11671","5f29bf8dcc1c0bc7d649379ceeadbf7f7ee7395e","ca3683605e53a4f998e1cfb7bb8ec4764699984f"],"title":"State-space Based Mass Event-history Model I: Many Decision-making Agents with One Target.","doi":"10.1214/08-AOAS189"}

However, many of the approaches disregard the correlation among endpoints. This can result in a conservative hypothesis testing strategy. The James procedure is an alternative approach that accounts for multiplicity among correlated continuous endpoints. Here a simulation study compares four Bonferroni-type alpha-adjustments (Bonferroni, Dunn-Sidák, Holm, and Hochberg) and the James p-value adjustment when used for multiple correlated binary variables. These procedures provided adequate protection against familywise type I error for correlated binary endpoints, albeit, at times, in an overly cautious manner. That is, when correlations among endpoints exceed 0.60, the result is somewhat conservative for the approaches that do not account for those correlations. Among the adjustments examined, the James approach appears to be the uniformly preferred method. Analyses of data from a randomized controlled clinical trial of treatments for mania in bipolar disorder are used to illustrate the application of the multiplicity adjustments.","inCitations":["34580bb198c63eb0a170a4ab3a18423727225aac","e54123f386d1428928252e80f02c171742485369","4bf27c5b2b104dfef773e6860739aef35524e6bc","87097c097c6c531fc52f6113172216819f9e01ed","333b614cab814df8e53d6eff8471e7820669ba19","3778acba98892b282b1533c63c266cbc2d1af59b","fca30ae5d47f8d3420b1bebba62e7fdca6386946","08445b95e56cfd725c492abf0599f848b7e40e83","f80985ca736dc49ed9d92351e428c04ccaab7abc","131fd022aa293773c7bbf54bdf6e416397723c54","c658930e46c5be74e29be60310cf8849829014a4","2585137e53f267ebe20d3164bd397d837ee344cc","935b33e9d2965f9870a2af10e58bec649241403c"],"title":"A comparison of multiplicity adjustment strategies for correlated binary endpoints.","doi":"10.1081/BIP-200067922"}

Virtually all of this work, however, presumes a common number of states for the true exposure status and the classified exposure status. In the simplest situation, for instance, both the true status and the classified status are binary. The present work diverges from the norm, in considering classification into three states when the actual exposure status is simply binary. Intuitively, the classification states might be labeled as `unlikely exposed,' `maybe exposed,' and `likely exposed.' While this situation has been discussed informally in the epidemiological literature, we provide some theory concerning what can be learned about the exposure-disease relationship, under various assumptions about the classification scheme. We focus on the challenging situation whereby no validation data is available from which to infer classification probabilities, but some prior assertions about these probabilities might be justified.","inCitations":["6dcf116f580ad8111c94ddb902f99dde7209c5a4","f68f4098a4b7e819123415791c7e0ab96105920a","71f80b36c7deb3663403a5993691e1c21044551b","584ff1bed91344eba85e2e2d50742b36258b8c8a"],"title":"Partial Identification arising from Nondifferential Exposure Misclassification: How Informative are Data on the Unlikely, Maybe, and Likely Exposed?","doi":"10.1515/1557-4679.1397"}

In the presence of well-established clinical risk factors, investigators often prefer a procedure that also adjusts for these clinical variables. While accelerated failure time (AFT) models are a useful tool for the analysis of censored outcome data, it assumes that covariate effects on the logarithm of time-to-event are linear, which is often unrealistic in practice. We propose to build risk prediction scores through regularized rank estimation in partly linear AFT models, where high-dimensional data such as gene expression data are modeled linearly and important clinical variables are modeled nonlinearly using penalized regression splines. We show through simulation studies that our model has better operating characteristics compared to several existing models. In particular, we show that there is a non-negligible effect on prediction as well as feature selection when nonlinear clinical effects are misspecified as linear. This work is motivated by a recent prostate cancer study, where investigators collected gene expression data along with established prognostic clinical variables and the primary endpoint is time to prostate cancer recurrence. We analyzed the prostate cancer data and evaluated prediction performance of several models based on the extended c statistic for censored data, showing that 1) the relationship between the clinical variable, prostate specific antigen, and the prostate cancer recurrence is likely nonlinear, i.e., the time to recurrence decreases as PSA increases and it starts to level off when PSA becomes greater than 11; 2) correct specification of this nonlinear effect improves performance in prediction and feature selection; and 3) addition of gene expression data does not seem to further improve the performance of the resultant risk prediction scores.","inCitations":["b4627cb676c2714110658956b15cb72b9c34531c"],"title":"Risk Prediction for Prostate Cancer Recurrence Through Regularized Estimation with Simultaneous Adjustment for Nonlinear Clinical Effects.","doi":"10.1214/11-AOAS458"}

As a result, the scientific hypotheses addressed by these studies have become more complex and more difficult to address using existing analytic methodologies. Obstacles to analysis include inference in the face of multiple comparisons, complications arising from correlations among the SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), choice of their genetic parametrization and missing data. In this paper we present an efficient Bayesian model search strategy that searches over the space of genetic markers and their genetic parametrization. The resulting method for Multilevel Inference of SNP Associations, MISA, allows computation of multilevel posterior probabilities and Bayes factors at the global, gene and SNP level, with the prior distribution on SNP inclusion in the model providing an intrinsic multiplicity correction. We use simulated data sets to characterize MISA's statistical power, and show that MISA has higher power to detect association than standard procedures. Using data from the North Carolina Ovarian Cancer Study (NCOCS), MISA identifies variants that were not identified by standard methods and have been externally \"validated\" in independent studies. We examine sensitivity of the NCOCS results to prior choice and method for imputing missing data. MISA is available in an R package on CRAN.","inCitations":["ef24d7e0e22ca5c4eca6521674b9db558cac2088","a881ab5b4083186f669e9fdec7e18d4308a7c6b4","4d4fbc078d85b853b7c3d02cfe569360b49bb801","3681373a791aeadc637ba927cdaf483fc5b3e959","a11ea3537bda13f2a4ed05810397856aaff03627","ae1ae3ee15b345c0d76fbe8b04b83ffb5cba2e13","73195dfbb620c2563b1e082b605b27e6c4ff60a7","219482abdcca07b534597306fb0f35f107d7f2b5","eb7ce3df868beb9de1ca8bced3e844c647ca9601","9dc0d4dd69612635081d0c132b0735014f7c0085","c36afca76cfc10068496dbe07e878094b55801bd","4bee547620f63b5ed7e8d957694029d7ef07180a","59a887e16eefe04da14625213ccef57224f0640d","a328faf454bec0ad841aed0084ce8ce475b75d46","5a0d9b629a28b48e8dad9acc61c79668f5b44b58","db898700d014a3ae5e8717968c97001e26eaad38","6c01b98a2d153d78894f5f5f612a314ca1d96d06","bad0f2eab027ad598129dcae0306b1fa9bef0b80","c4c4aa2cda017f1c368dad25ea32901ed2833ecb","ee0dbe40132c72890dc52c3e0ae996c617e60b81","1853fd8a442a1413ae09bea199d02859d58bf000","981c4f0d56e9a60e668e5db8a6e17a7fa9d09e61","5983328730b803bda61c27360c321cd8124285ee","d1f2d78bf551b97e4c6e0a522d40ce837265c683","0e6b358328b1f7b99f3f73ad0828ed76656f7e53","f20efc4484ff869e7c807d3bf6cac09e5e4709aa","ffbafe4e4e3752d92f13f1414e2bb476ff3daf95","019b85b5dd8cf73a6a6c49b4971bb3448405db59","01ce3271c8e354eafdb7df661a95b76abc2bb403","3582bea873386a0c74366055fb35615cf0f42d69","87e678e1fb1e5a3618c86ca41645aedec60eb39c","9386ed54aba167a251886ec18e2eb2b36aeecfc6","3824f1ac7c45e1278ae119421d14e19de0ab67c1","7cd48e816eadd67efe992f1380929edec510cea8","7c392d2bb94834b282361d009ce02e6f5e202767","334e1ccd6877e39f080b2f3f9dc70872c32093da","2760372d268d99a0831f3389784561668571fa60","ca93e113c373543e89d8aac91b8a0ff00fc12f10","f0e3ff2ae2dffa7b90214fb7fe238aba534e156f","c1487c02fadd68b82916667932183f8fa3764bb8","410046116fb4d00097fce17c875d76db6f84c0f6","193fa72a8bed5999c23025cbc55bd54f78cd9f52","8600835e3ae5c973d88e17fdddda492d899ad71b","78292eefa0142d97d0073814e3e89b2f18dc05b4","d3ec33be99af74612a53bd36cae273125f8fa727","e49e3843de4257e58be0d0105ec5d82fda4438d3","321d136b50d0db07b584bf627d89af52bbbcb71a"],"title":"Bayesian Model Search and Multilevel Inference for Snp Association Studies.","doi":"10.1214/09-AOAS322"}

However, many geophysical and environmental processes often display non-Gaussian characteristics. In this paper, we propose a new class of spatial models for non-Gaussian random fields on a sphere based on a multi-resolution analysis. Using a special wavelet frame, named spherical needlets, as building blocks, the proposed model is constructed in the form of a sparse random effects model. The spatial localization of needlets, together with carefully chosen random coefficients, ensure the model to be non-Gaussian and isotropic. The model can also be expanded to include a spatially varying variance profile. The special formulation of the model enables us to develop efficient estimation and prediction procedures, in which an adaptive MCMC algorithm is used. We investigate the accuracy of parameter estimation of the proposed model, and compare its predictive performance with that of two Gaussian models by extensive numerical experiments. Practical utility of the proposed model is demonstrated through an application of the methodology to a data set of high-latitude ionospheric electrostatic potentials, generated from the LFM-MIX model of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.","inCitations":["ac58a0b2b27a8e72d5f9b0526c912a5dc40fcf92","7efc62e408a9a32ea2fdb6edd4f7b5db9a518299","4ed71c461984e972e6937e16da94579916b3c14e","51a6967ac121d35758ced25d35024c706968adab"],"title":"A Multi-resolution Model for Non-gaussian Random Fields on a Sphere with Application to Ionospheric Electrostatic Potentials.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1104"}

This yields a set of biochemical and physiological markers containing valuable information to anticipate a failure of the graft. A general linear, generalized linear, or nonlinear mixed model is used to describe the longitudinal profile of each marker. To account for the correlation between markers, the univariate mixed models are combined into a multivariate mixed model (MMM) by specifying a joint distribution for the random effects. Due to the high number of markers, a pairwise modeling strategy, where all possible pairs of bivariate mixed models are fitted, is used to obtain parameter estimates for the MMM. These estimates are used in a Bayes rule to obtain, at each point in time, the prognosis for long-term success of the transplant. It is shown that allowing the markers to be correlated can improve this prognosis.","inCitations":["f8e2c0aeb23e61b15d96f4d35dc7618724f9aa14","ed474dc4ff8480f26774286cfa0e1577a8fca8d0","cc020607ab4404aa14c1b805db99fab61483e0d5","7aad3cc07f36bb8e9cba99a22043a3183ea47b06","a312d4f2158cf578ab9bf3979ce7c778d4adb7a0","43bd82acf649a1cbe3536a7d5126faf80ced323b","26d7087c27a6667e9f636e2c27e0c781f7b3250d","45bfec33e8f53163361a1c5ad657bd0f27437615","728a06f15646b51b064ca73963eac7266c45dce7","48efc98e411102e9f8f4aad3acb2aa9b0d30e8e2","3629dc61d3b8782a1cf9fb60c411619f5531eeb4","4fbe5e95693df02edfded4fbecbfe7ee06610366","480bacc5701fbdf893be20959833f1edebf78817","8a4516ddbe8b5e6a07295118b7c36ba2b579fa45","c230cb8b3df4ef14c5f09fccf1e30b3737c80200","66893b99bd9c25d556d2a9a77a3a596bceb90a90","2751705a6458031dbd5a9ede7316dfc347d011ee","dd3610f34bcadb99c04503c94686707a29cf469e","926e4da2d1a8ef4aeaeb6b9bcede6808bf5a6ac5","90120e0f2587a3c8e3bd94bc473f613db3210a97","3d86f6467330c9fb5bfc09189d2457a9e3222b4f","a7cab72e3141109f583b23656bf3f3e19d05ee25","f4a4c24bc3a0b3dcd0e626970ca84e458de5ae61","f4b185ac0908fc76935fbec3636448488510ce26","1f788c44f2866a0f82e548b64adf1f2486786d23","cbee125c71d7536d3d1786228bb6067954ec8b6f","2c9bb30a136e7970ab1505039222b3ff33ddd7ce","51b8c89d189f4068e65a2f75d73c3c8cbfe470b2","eca098c7973890c5f8842cf3bccbf33657f28c12","695e61a39a35fa4d5a70d12d278cc3841ab97ce0"],"title":"Predicting renal graft failure using multivariate longitudinal profiles.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxm041"}

It is shown that conjoint systems analogous to the numerical composition rules advanced by the Rasch, many facet Rasch and two-parameter logistic models can be formulated using well-established axioms, representation theorems and proofs.

Towards a better understanding of why some individuals and groups acquiesce more strongly than others do, we developed a unified conceptual framework of acquiescent responding. Our framework posits that acquiescent responding is a joint function of respondent characteristics (e.g. age, education, values), situational/survey characteristics (e.g., interview privacy, respondents' interest), and cultural characteristics (e.g., social norms, economic development). The framework posits two putative mechanisms through which these characteristics may relate to acquiescence: cognitive processing capacities and deferential communication styles. Multilevel analyses using data from 60 heterogeneous countries from the World Values Survey (N = 90,347) support our framework's proposition that acquiescence is a joint function of respondent, situational, and cultural characteristics. Acquiescence was higher among respondents who were older (over 55 years old), less educated, who valued deference (i.e., conformity and tradition), and, unexpectedly, were male. Interview privacy corresponded to lower acquiescence, but this association was small and vanished after including respondent characteristics. Unexpectedly, acquiescence was higher in interviewees who showed a stronger interest in the interview. Finally, acquiescence was considerably higher in countries with stronger social norms of deference. We discuss implications of these findings for the validity of research based on self-report data and delineate how our framework can guide future inquiries into acquiescent responding.","inCitations":["990eb059009f982c6558e4a3795eb672c2654b50","417dca5d0d639b25cca3b7b7570031562cd466f1","7ced6bb6a8cd928cbd912423014da0e74eb07e3a"],"title":"Individual, situational, and cultural correlates of acquiescent responding: Towards a unified conceptual framework.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12164"}

The pilot study was a matched-pairs design where some data are missing, specifically the missing data coming at the end of the study. Existing approaches to determine sample size are all based on asymptotic approaches (e.g., the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach). When the sample size in a clinical trial is small to medium, these asymptotic approaches may not be appropriate for use due to the unsatisfactory Type I and II error rates. For this reason, we consider the exact unconditional approach to compute the sample size for a matched-pairs study with incomplete data. Recommendations are made for each possible missingness pattern by comparing the exact sample sizes based on three commonly used test statistics, with the existing sample size calculation based on the GEE approach. An example from a real surgeon-reviewers study is used to illustrate the application of the exact sample size calculation in study designs.","inCitations":["d9628fb9c9c4628aad5a8d15184fef0fc1c6de4d"],"title":"Sample size determination for a matched-pairs study with incomplete data using exact approach.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12107"}

For each of these hypotheses, various statistical tests have been proposed. Over the years, these tests have depended on progressively fewer assumptions. We propose a new approach to testing the three hypotheses that relies on even fewer assumptions, is especially suited for discrete item scores, and can be applied easily to tests containing large numbers of items. The new approach uses marginal modelling. We compared the Type I error rate and the power of the marginal modelling approach to several of the available tests in a simulation study using realistic conditions. We found that the marginal modelling approach had the most accurate Type I error rates, whereas the power was similar across the statistical tests.","inCitations":["a996c846510c20f54b83d608824dcfebed738338","9e09fb78258ea17889fda9143cad3910858c97dd","a22b1cb9feceea481bee9cd064386b87c396be77","b3c57dab8970f04eebed1f93b9ea1148429159d7","5660551638ee5da4784bc152ec75c8fc7d709c96","27ab97bb5c6b033b6a012d8eb1a8a42afcfc424c","a510eefd7b762e1d7b8830a00a4c2e7d570e02c0","810ceb9375b8e9c2a0992ef4a3d25d1103408795","665efa60d316ae2a1997caa20e9c21084f4be15a"],"title":"Testing hypotheses involving Cronbach's alpha using marginal models.","doi":"10.1111/bmsp.12010"}

The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated by numerical simulations, and by the estimation of a change point for amygdalar atrophy in the context of Alzheimer's disease, wherein it is related to the cognitive manifestation of the disease.","inCitations":["3ee30cbd007168203fd4ef54c05fe933869492b4","55fa07b5229b7991187379f75ff451b7cceb1504"],"title":"Biomarker Change-point Estimation with Right Censoring in Longitudinal Studies.","doi":"10.1214/17-AOAS1056"}
