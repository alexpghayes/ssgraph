The conclusions obtained are (1) the optimal method in general (and particularly for errors α = 1% and 5%) is based on arcsine transformation, with the maximum likelihood estimator restricted to the null hypothesis and increasing the successes and failures by 3/8; (2) the optimal method for α = 10% is a modification of the classic model of Peskun; (3) a more simple and acceptable option for large sample sizes and values of d not near to ±1 is the classic method of Peskun; and (4) in the particular case of the superiority and inferiority tests, the optimal method is the classic Wald method (with continuity correction) when the successes and failures are increased by one. We additionally select the optimal methods to make compatible the conclusions of the homogeneity test and the CI for d, both for one tail and for two (methods which are related to arcsine transformation and the Wald method).","inCitations":["1bdf7a87d4318961de267b2526eb70503db2f906"],"title":"One-tailed asymptotic inferences for the difference of proportions: Analysis of 97 methods of inference.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2018.1452028"}

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Medicine"],"year":2002,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"The speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) paradigm forces participants to trade response speed for information accuracy by presenting them with a response signal at variable times after the onset of processing to which they must give an immediate response (within 300 ms). The processes that underlie the paradigm, especially those affecting response times, are not completely understood. Also, the extent to which the paradigm might affect the evidence accumulation process is still unclear. By testing several different sets of assumptions, we present a random walk model for the SAT paradigm that qualitatively explains both accuracy and response time data. The model uses a tandem random walk, with two possible continuations in a second phase which begins after the response signal. If a boundary is not reached during phase one, the walk transfers the current sum (relative to the size of the boundaries) from phase one to phase two in the form of bias, with drift rate equal to zero. If, however, a boundary is reached in phase one, the second phase starts from zero (no bias) with a strong drift rate towards the previously reached boundary. The model also incorporates a psychological refractory period: a delay in the onset of a second task when two tasks are presented in close succession. The model is consistent with the idea that information about the evidence accumulation rate is not contaminated by the paradigm.","inCitations":["197fd9f5dc66b8f6ba30a137eb8d3c433c65d293","81a54a418f901bfaba50e2f59ea581c5deb91e67","7a7d82571f650fe306b730a61c13354c20405314","0afff4b0a7e5d68c5687f04b7711585dd064798e","f18dc11b4f38c128cf96494f0d3b1c8cc7367658"],"title":"A tandem random walk model of the SAT paradigm: response times and accumulation of evidence.","doi":"10.1348/000711002760554589"}

Currently a large number of AIDS clinical trials on HIV dynamics are in development worldwide. However, many design issues that arise from AIDS clinical trials have not been addressed. In this paper, we use a simulation-based approach to deal with design problems in Bayesian hierarchical nonlinear (mixed-effects) models. The underlying model characterizes the long-term viral dynamics with antiretroviral treatment where we directly incorporate drug susceptibility and exposure into a function of treatment efficacy. The Bayesian design method is investigated under the framework of hierarchical Bayesian (mixed-effects) models. We compare a finite number of feasible candidate designs numerically, which are currently used in AIDS clinical trials from different perspectives, and provide guidance on how a design might be chosen in practice.","inCitations":["a4fb111516abd252dd58b8dd5eb5763280560ea6","7af308bbbf5508e15fe2cae8834011360064f38d","b248c3a24d4684495b3ae93a61bfaed4bfe514e1"],"title":"Bayesian Experimental Design for Long-Term Longitudinal HIV Dynamic Studies.","doi":"10.1016/j.jspi.2007.05.019"}

In such a setup, the criterion involves inference concerning an appropriate regression parameter, and the criterion holds if the regression parameter is zero. Testing such a null hypothesis has been criticized in the literature since it can only be used to reject a poor surrogate, and not to validate a good surrogate. In order to circumvent this, an equivalence hypothesis is formulated for the regression parameter, namely the hypothesis that the parameter is equivalent to zero. Such an equivalence hypothesis is formulated as an alternative hypothesis, so that the surrogate endpoint is statistically validated when the null hypothesis is rejected. Confidence intervals for the regression parameter and tests for the equivalence hypothesis are proposed using bootstrap methods and small sample asymptotics, and their performances are numerically evaluated and recommendations are made. The choice of the equivalence margin is a regulatory issue that needs to be addressed. The proposed equivalence testing formulation is also adopted for other parameters that have been proposed in the literature on surrogate endpoint validation, namely, the relative effect and proportion explained.","inCitations":["5977036810ae175d7a1b5d8823dd99549b9977ee"],"title":"Statistical Validation of Surrogate Endpoints: Another Look at the Prentice Criterion and Other Criteria.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.971174"}

A variety of alterations that occur in chromosomal DNA, many of which can be detected using high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, are linked to normal variation as well as disease and therefore of particular interest. These include changes in copy number (deletions and duplications) and genotype (e.g. the occurrence of regions of homozygosity). Hidden Markov models (HMM) are particularly useful for detecting such alterations, modeling the spatial dependence between neighboring SNPs. Here, we improve previous approaches that utilize HMM frameworks for inference in high throughput SNP arrays by integrating copy number, genotype calls, and the corresponding measures of uncertainty when available. Using simulated and experimental data, we in particular demonstrate how confidence scores control smoothing in a probabilistic framework. Software for fitting HMMs to SNP array data is available in the R package vanillaICE.","inCitations":["03e7f5081f73e5dd43bb02939e10b648fa8a91a8","8484fdc21c3a3e8b294ec7ad495432c9618231df","f5378ebe5b6bfb5d0cda62138d039db25647f0f4","54efc0b3d8d75cdb0ff33bd8178506c57f6f9a4a","0c81fcba3aaeb180d4d0520d68eb70015457e849","d897c5c7021929ded970868c714db0569987ae59","9738c05a22079b72767c8f15fa28b4aa28023e6f","47a3bc917b75208fe8d346a4cad4be980965e762","0221d48199c33260b3f4c8c70fae6f233152ac0e","ee5c8264b9949b7998584f1cbbb9c09a1e7c5d4a","847333b75570e8de2b695653bcfbaa737e908d8c","c89d032c9e588bcdfe66ee53226d20541826aada","afe5abb89c7ea6bf8d17ab2329b786579f9a5e38","18e4d679fb375899eb8bd6001bf48ddfe3e0f281","f0421e039b905323e399b9c19889f7caa9e36852","ff7ec01e32f784dc154c761c05da82324144ad90","5a35429703273d6607e606a7b8adeefde5913d25","e03fb3d1ec6551b83c7997de91fb63d57d8fef00","7c6bb6c4e4215ff21841829f3def219175ba0ee3","594b6136d5475cfa84391b60609dded1e7d36c05","5d2fa7ebdb61d83ae7954bb48b7f7d44dd16b7ad","96e6f4cde803d31e95cbada77bb38178efcfc3c7","c955535d7d482b875cfa897cd07a6d224d4a3111","84f3b47f503470e373b8471df607cd8d305b1b3e","ecf023b4341e6fa243bfc4ba50532c8f77319b2d","f39ac83acd3d9e18ce4cbad436d0b120f802585b","03bbf44bc42c24492fdd24e104d53a4cd4d8ad8b","0bf2fbfcd7bbc611eb8db4358bad7a870bf830b5","09d0ae0aacc42c864696ba9d801b6f40b623e258","0cb73de5aab00eecd072d86246fd4a68bb36bd63","8a422f9e50a30f493e4262a782fff462a64bc9d8","b10a7ad22e416ecba4529de926f1019c8be11be6","378e332261ac944d737da74d53dbb78874e863d2","e6b2f2e128a7083c048cc9d9495e0a2b2c2c20fd","21fbf63f869e7e3195632a815be08fd151ebb77c","8d5540e3350956b860ea4d9f74aaddbcdc1a65ed","9cfa34640b5c5de5273947cdfe7ca3b445d90427","38023b9aac8e3da82a1cc992a646d15bbfd098c0","87ce7174d7bae04e31d60521bbeabb87d108d1e4","c4019a11eea74cdff71ee3f54251bcf18f038eb1","415b08a187702717e0b8bc20e4f0266d3da6672c","335de4f9ee6b91a2e8ab8ea590e37c8ac270891e","49e25b04140fa4169cf70f867c6ed4119ce71eae"],"title":"Hidden Markov models for the assessment of chromosomal alterations using high-throughput SNP arrays.","doi":"10.1214/07-AOAS155"}

Previous studies have shown in linear models that independent variable error can attenuate the slope estimate with a corresponding increase in the intercept. Monte Carlo simulation was used to examine the impact of assay measurement error (AME) on the parameter estimates of an LMEM and nonlinear MEM (NMEM) concentration-ddQTc interval model from a 'typical' thorough QT study. For the LMEM, the type I error rate was unaffected by assay measurement error. Significant slope attenuation ( > 10%) occurred when the AME exceeded > 40% independent of the sample size. Increasing AME also decreased the between-subject variance of the slope, increased the residual variance, and had no effect on the between-subject variance of the intercept. For a typical analytical assay having an assay measurement error of less than 15%, the relative bias in the estimates of the model parameters and variance components was less than 15% in all cases. The NMEM appeared to be more robust to AME error as most parameters were unaffected by measurement error. Monte Carlo simulation was then used to determine whether the simulation-extrapolation method of parameter bias correction could be applied to cases of large AME in LMEMs. For analytical assays with large AME ( > 30%), the simulation-extrapolation method could correct biased model parameter estimates to near-unbiased levels.","inCitations":["f9b4e64b8f47e373655a10ef209981aa13c47f4a","7072cd774cf079bc43fcef81b6250546537954e1","63ae53470d86b600a5679a20f3813130746a5696","1770105a7733aac0e4996e196e3c2ed5a8a106c4","a527b2c414560fdc062ae6a9f0255cde6600c777","1501b3fe8cf5aa4c5b74464fe3bf3304f21c251a","ee42b1a3b21e40fc1031c5e8101360381484d0b2","1a10015ef3fc6969d001b98d93d22637946b659e"],"title":"Effect of assay measurement error on parameter estimation in concentration-QTc interval modeling.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1567"}

We invert a nonparametric likelihood test of uniformity, constructed from the Kaplan–Meier estimator of the survivor function, to obtain simultaneous lower and upper bands for the function of interest with specified global confidence level. The method involves calculating a null distribution and associated critical value for each observed sample configuration. However, Noe recursions and the Van Wijngaarden–Decker–Brent root-finding algorithm provide the necessary tools for efficient computation of these exact bounds. Various aspects of the effect of right censoring on these exact bands are investigated, using as illustrations two observational studies of survival experience among non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients and a much larger group of subjects with advanced lung cancer enrolled in trials within the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the merits of the proposed method of deriving simultaneous interval estimates of the survivor function across the entire range of the observed sample.

The technique of sensitivity analysis is used to investigate the importance of assumptions made to calculate heritability estimates. This permits not only the investigation of specific assumptions, but also the effects of different combinations of assumptions. The assumptions examined include: the level of assortative mating, degree of intra-pair environmental similarity of MZ as opposed to DZ twins, and the presence of genotype-environment covariance. It is noted that estimates of genetic variance—although large—are sensitive to small changes in these assumptions, and that different combinations of assumptions can produce similar estimates of genetic variance. Although this work is effected within the classical twin method, its implications are also valid for more sophisticated analyses of the ‘nature-nurture’ problem.","inCitations":["fc79931f3d173da466c413679239086d1bbd710d","7c30269473ed2a7792766fedc2445fea60b0af46","02e3b6413ee8cc35a15bbb8d2c3741df0cfebf30","bf7c390503069ca94053cc9e8a6b2238b93c82b1"],"title":"Monozygotic and dizygotic twins reared together: sensitivity of heritability estimates.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.1974.tb00523.x"}

Interest in meta-analysis in brain mapping is also driven by a recent focus on so-called \"reverse inference\": where as traditional \"forward inference\" identifies the regions of the brain involved in a task, a reverse inference identifies the cognitive processes that a task engages. Such reverse inferences, however, requires a set of meta-analysis, one for each possible cognitive domain. However, existing methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis have significant limitations. Commonly used methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis are not model based, do not provide interpretable parameter estimates, and only produce null hypothesis inferences; further, they are generally designed for a single group of studies and cannot produce reverse inferences. In this work we address these limitations by adopting a non-parametric Bayesian approach for meta analysis data from multiple classes or types of studies. In particular, foci from each type of study are modeled as a cluster process driven by a random intensity function that is modeled as a kernel convolution of a gamma random field. The type-specific gamma random fields are linked and modeled as a realization of a common gamma random field, shared by all types, that induces correlation between study types and mimics the behavior of a univariate mixed effects model. We illustrate our model on simulation studies and a meta analysis of five emotions from 219 studies and check model fit by a posterior predictive assessment. In addition, we implement reverse inference by using the model to predict study type from a newly presented study. We evaluate this predictive performance via leave-one-out cross validation that is efficiently implemented using importance sampling techniques.","inCitations":["7281ef55d676daca53ce343c2f1a75202d7f731b","707712f3e7c6846c6e5365dc8df4bb91adc82c9d","96690403908bd7d15fe325ecb4095e1d20e80778","57e16918a286055edf76080645bd61bbb2757804","91bd50020d4816e56ad71b2ae594029e1d77256a","d4f4ee3c0e9852181a0416458c9282a2e5e31930","a30b074a53da1abf0c8e237fe680d3a3fe6b000f","3c1931a6a7d39fd4913fc16faf27a60bf53b30e2","119f15c5d1613e825e6b2468c90698cc9170834f","8e7ddc4f8f22011df4f036338dd952f4f2724ddf","487f2c9c08d5912a2d4056aaa6b6767ebc984b22","391e19f9d46566eb00603dca983e93ecc03244db"],"title":"A Bayesian Hierarchical Spatial Point Process Model for Multi-type Neuroimaging Meta-analysis.","doi":"10.1214/14-AOAS757"}

However, longitudinal studies of viral load are complicated by left censoring of the measures due to a lower quantification limit. We propose a full likelihood approach to estimate parameters from the linear mixed effects model for left-censored Gaussian data. For each subject, the contribution to the likelihood is the product of the density for the vector of the completely observed outcome and of the conditional distribution function of the vector of the censored outcome, given the observed outcomes. Values of the distribution function were computed by numerical integration. The maximization is performed by a combination of the Simplex algorithm and the Marquardt algorithm. Subject-specific deviations and random effects are estimated by modified empirical Bayes replacing censored measures by their conditional expectations given the data. A simulation study showed that the proposed estimators are less biased than those obtained by imputing the quantification limit to censored data. Moreover, for models with complex covariance structures, they are less biased than Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) estimators developed by Hughes (1999) Mixed effects models with censored data with application to HIV RNA Levels.

The method was then applied to the data of the ALBI-ANRS 070 clinical trial for which HIV-1 RNA levels were measured with an ultrasensitive assay (quantification limit 50 copies/ml). Using the proposed method, estimates obtained with data artificially censored at 500 copies/ml were close to those obtained with the real data set.","inCitations":["017b590a6e1b51099475a103c8646754ca407c38","0e558a1ad6f1986846287955f138bcdf75693d45","1602fe7f62e21f48e3f1759bdf7e3a2da7f264d6","2e7e2a667ccdd67d2e8603f3c26ce4306fb8de36","fde38ee45fa2d3d62b3c9bd268add9e9519b10ad","43a4c70cffd2a8a5bb8c09c784b4a897e31fedd5","a0f3287625fca75fb315c76c1abe196fd892aa94","dd6995a5545f7a286912ed2e50fd58f0dce346de","4ec1a1bd4f38b2df7bf8c481f4cfa9b031f2f1d7","c269dea0a2ed00e35377ea9441a7e3bf7ef4e361","9b455e84076da95270327cb490c4246f35f750a2","167c8c5c80481a1e99e6a484ad193af707020323","32ddd4cffab7b57f29d5d0900457bfdda0add3f8","2be6c7b35d07af2108224e08fa4bf814b0721857","26351a966afe1b83c6fa19cf5d6cc1f02d89f822","b91dfbdda0bec4e0b2d528e35ed5267af334e6b2","7188b7883af28b343674c59b9c2d2d3b54e8607b","40604b6a3a3ce376169468a88ce07fef64393fa0","ab691486fec4b22fb8994b59bd29901e1d265d68","d9e461868bd20b2758f1b66fa8369255be18c346","446716e34ff04b6f9e67409142cd0d21ebffaade","ed5cc571ba6d813464aedbf2b95fcc1ba64e9bda","cce2ce5c8f3ae7f74f8e4446f98c8abe8fb45368","0ec4a0c86f42d19411024de249450b576dad488d","af5708242788ac5e8ee47419c5976621efa50180","a27be166094dc252940f5d2e8bc5af0a30b99b65","acb1a45ce084dafa4df5021e1d7a083b6b1f9ecd","586262817d1501e5b8bc3518a056472277e48d3d","cf30bdb595b3eadd8660893f69d1aae55d26be3b","83c96072bc396d5b72a4e9057b8c2fdbd2e252f0","53ed04442c6756daa7c6539763340c35297a1c81","8a248a7ba87ddf853dad6e1c486a3f18bf2f619f","0a1f44087afba34d3b3d514972afe4adcee8302c","905f0e11f4cd678c72b31d3765e4bd7430fa0d08","219c92d0a9538d1674f17248c55673fc6531790b","b2aae6341a1441ae3fea0230048134220682195e","fa739cfbb05aeb01dea9fb287efb5c7bbfed47fb","70048123fbeff709212e59371b2bcfd19ffd2923","7796c256db0f8573d7cc0cdbbd9ea05a33ec0d6f","79b2b12187e94c29c5d63db6e3b512c4bdb6d68c","50558e5283d66241cc00156d1f660819a9be145b","18ab8bb3ffd8332981db6156e1127a5c5c74f53a","d45d0e79baac4eb7674dbb325a1cfb0984e00dcb","32b44936a298b2c645979241fb800aaeec91d7c4","8963209b68bc27ebe9f0be41e5ecf7659b46aa42","97115c1e203a48b4ab0dc4affdc719eadb2aee78","83ed569bf0f37ebe95717cca93ed90a8e499152d","265f1c2231173ce981bcf7b9a02d45b4c123c60a","c5670c42b5f01b4990c780d4425326dd4fac11ff","8e5cc430b2e8b174f0df82a2bb0e78f7eb079d94","1cd006aac531f63ded805ee5162864f09bf8466e","c79ebddf1a78780264440384c1bc65da9ca49c37","39986e81b72f129d8e2fcf29ca961fef9991b420","9684bb8b0782295c55c71e017b1019580d1b1c61","a824c3abcd043deed64078a5523ddd35bca85aac","6de5433718324f13d0d6e64c9a704a3da10c706b","3e0731b24085e20640b37b1da951d2f20dd5a22b","f2e5a93e937e3eb7720add3083d2fc138cafc2b6","5b487217ab57bcae91772af0cb166445acbea5ee","5d3cec431348aa8f793c1b2f43ea88400ccb7fe2","51483d57c71b28ad8853c49d2c867503d39e738a","c1d58ce997387091d24534f0641b655b0a2f207b","284f9bec49c9a32b533398acedaa43a5afe7a8f5","10194be7910e9751015782bd234f89bf537bc835","6337b6a2867de9506b4547d3185bcc8c555be136","77e83b5433db514020d91c97b9882ea6741311c6","41b32c48864e406248b5113556dfe2f5dfa0fa8e","6f0fa6bca5d3be483a50911637455cf5a66082ec","e555be80143ae03aca907e07fe00d2608eda2810","9fdca34568859bf16d9104b3f7ff06fea13955a3"],"title":"Analysis of left-censored longitudinal data with application to viral load in HIV infection.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.355"}

It is assumed that the data curves are noisy samples from the vector space span{f1, …, fm }, where f1, …, fm are unknown functions on the real interval (0, T) with square-integrable derivatives of all orders m or less, and m < n. Ramsay (1996) first proposed the method of regularized principal differential analysis as an alternative to principal component analysis for finding low dimensional approximations to curves. Principal differential analysis (PDA) is based on the following theorem: there exists an annihilating linear differential operator [Formula: see text] of order m such that [Formula: see text], i = 1, …, m (Coddington and Levinson 1955, Theorem 6.2). Principal differential analysis specifies m, then uses the data to estimate an annihilating linear differential operator (LDO). Smooth estimates of the coefficients of the LDO are obtained by minimizing a penalized sum of the squared norm of the residuals. In this context, the residual is that part of the data curve that is not annihilated by the LDO. PDA obtains the smooth low dimensional approximation to the data curves by projecting onto the null space of the estimated annihilating LDO; PDA is thus useful for obtaining low dimensional approximations to the data curves whether or not the interpretation of the annihilating LDO is intuitive or obvious from the context of the data. This paper extends PDA to allow for the coefficients in the linear differential operator to smoothly depend upon a single continuous covariate. The estimating equations for the coefficients allowing for a continuous covariate are derived; the penalty of Eilers and Marx (1996) is used to impose smoothness. The results of a small computer simulation study investigating the bias and variance properties of the estimator are reported.","inCitations":["becb4514a7cc5867ea595720fe64457f7c7d2f2e","93c45c9b2f3929e6d31d7b84006421c9d7547cc7","d07e0ba608bd18ec35d0bfe7fd61ca86dfa93f27"],"title":"Principal Differential Analysis with a Continuous Covariate: Low Dimensional Approximations for Functional Data.","doi":"10.1080/00949655.2012.675575"}

Despite recent developments on the integrative dimension reduction of such data, most existing methods cannot easily accommodate data of multiple types (e.g. binary or count-valued). Moreover, multi-source data often have block-wise missing structure, i.e. data in one or more sources may be completely unobserved for a sample. The heterogeneous data types and presence of block-wise missing data pose significant challenges to the integration of multi-source data and further statistical analyses. In this article, we develop a low-rank method, called generalized integrative principal component analysis (GIPCA), for the simultaneous dimension reduction and imputation of multi-source block-wise missing data, where different sources may have different data types. We also devise an adapted Bayesian information criterion (BIC) criterion for rank estimation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of rank estimation, signal recovery, and missing data imputation. We apply GIPCA to a mortality study. We achieve accurate block-wise missing data imputation and identify intriguing latent mortality rate patterns with sociological relevance.","inCitations":["1df9134d61f16271cdd4537c446b2546d0c72a61","30796225edb6df79662228c76eeadbbb582c950c","9e1955f569252f2701f9f84997e18cd4bf43abb1"],"title":"Generalized integrative principal component analysis for multi-type data with block-wise missing structure.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy052"}

We use a Bayesian approach to compare single-arm and randomized studies, based on a binary response variable, in terms of their abilities of reaching the correct decision about the new treatment, both when it performs better than the standard one and when it is less effective.

Motivated by the fact that there exists natural grouping structure in single nucleotide polymorphisms and, more importantly, such groups are correlated, we propose a new penalization method for group variable selection which can properly accommodate the correlation between adjacent groups. This method is based on a combination of the group Lasso penalty and a quadratic penalty on the difference of regression coefficients of adjacent groups. The new method is referred to as smoothed group Lasso (SGL). It encourages group sparsity and smoothes regression coefficients for adjacent groups. Canonical correlations are applied to the weights between groups in the quadratic difference penalty. We first derive a GCD algorithm for computing the solution path with linear regression model. The SGL method is further extended to logistic regression for binary response. With the assistance of the majorize-minimization algorithm, the SGL penalized logistic regression turns out to be an iteratively penalized least-square problem.

When the difference in population means between two treatments is not 0, the proportion of the type II error rate allocated to each of the two tails of the central t-distribution cannot be analytically determined. Hence, no close form of the exact sample size for the equivalence hypothesis is available. Currently only approximate formulas are proposed. The resulting sample sizes may provide either insufficient power or unnecessarily excessive power. We suggest an approximate approach with consideration of type II error rates for both one-sided hypotheses to determination of the sample size for the equivalence hypothesis.

In such a scenario, with plasma concentration data collected in the studies, a modeling approach can be applied to predict treatment effects at different plasma concentration levels. Through an established relationship between plasma concentration and dose, the treatment effects of doses not studied in the Phase III studies can then be predicted. The results can further be applied to justify the final dose confirmation or selection. In this article, a Phase III program example with count data as the primary endpoint in the multiple sclerosis area is used to illustrate the application of such a technique for dose confirmation. Several models, such as the overdispersion Poisson model, negative binomial model, and recurrent event models, are considered. The negative binomial model is preferable due to better data fitting and the capability of within-treatment assessment and between-treatment comparison.","inCitations":["4122d4f122fa19f99ab6509364f354dde706b825"],"title":"A case study of modeling and exposure-response prediction for count data.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.929584"}

Drug and medical device clinical trialists are increasingly confronted with data that feature complex correlation structures, and are costly and difficult to obtain. In such settings, Bayesian trial designs are attractive since they can incorporate historical data or information from published literature, thus saving time and expense and minimizing the number of subjects exposed to an inferior treatment. Bayesian designs can also adapt to unexpected changes in the protocol, and allow the investigator to explore the plausibility of various outcome scenarios before any patients are enrolled in the trial. Recently, the FDA Center for Devices has encouraged hierarchical Bayesian statistical approaches which allow for the incorporation of such valuable historical data into the design and analysis of new device trials. The practical application of these methods has only become feasible in the last decade due to advances in computing via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, especially as implemented in the popular BUGS software package. In this paper we illustrate Bayesian analysis and sample size calculations using BRugs, a function for calling BUGS from R. We provide illustrations in two applied settings where incorporation of available historical information is crucial, one concerning an AIDS drug trial and the other a comparison of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs).","inCitations":["3df93a36d4c7082cba42f7babf3822c673801f13","47ebdf27f6b44c86615ef98e14c86e2c253e8a58","d75cdd848d257898e338afee4a5d766abfea24ca","dea60927efbd1f284b4132eae3461ea7ce0fb62a","bda965eeeb555455ffe74c159d2c061e7f9c78b0","3cd3f257fc773d906dd65e9fbe898d3722a46787","4a47be4d4a315cea5d27353fc26836f63a527660","fd58b6cebcb43ca7ab8314b4b2dc30d0b5e83b35","4c1e8b28dde732ae98a5815374716578226c9a98","78aef5686e1592f61d0c3e047f8069f69d735c2f","5611e82f39a445d59a68cf20f9bc4600b924b3f5","b7f978969763ef4bf920b3783bae29cfffca1aab","cacca9b1d46d34a788a84eebc5cf223f711dfdca","620eec97506678b5b0a90b149fb2753b8af46a7a","e3436af832c81e8fea634439ad951588ab5e8d05","9423b4b3d04996c635c7448401bee71b7a19e76e","c9e736157c630b61d629228f8353f1d01f4d7075","cab87496c9e617331e1bd2449352239a3f70fda3","4e2f43dab69d690dc86422949e410ebf37f522d4","d4c1fb0671cd553fd4ad6ff4c98deae6094b0b5c","60e40163ebd1caa4ca15d9fa5f4bb622b6ca0056","1dbf04ce10f7b2be1aaabe834416f7660cd14471","095cbe7b1eccb44977ac277e2e2b915ce69023c0","ab0d29c6f5fdf30efeba91cd398f665b98c79079","f371e5954f92f843e0cee1ed414581ac494858fd","ef6bbdf722d4a0266f571e9c6910353efb294545","ad6d8e1f1e9b4b4e02f3423f2a939df61042e9af"],"title":"Practical Bayesian design and analysis for drug and device clinical trials.","doi":"10.1080/10543400701668266"}

In addition to the treatment assignment and outcome, data on baseline covariates, such as demographic characteristics or biomarker measurements, are typically collected. Incorporating such auxiliary co-variates in the analysis of randomized trials can increase power, but questions remain about how to preserve type I error when incorporating such covariates in a flexible way, particularly when the number of randomized units is small. Using the Young Citizens study, a cluster randomized trial of an educational intervention to promote HIV awareness, we compare several methods to evaluate intervention effects when baseline covariates are incorporated adaptively. To ascertain the validity of the methods shown in small samples, extensive simulation studies were conducted. We demonstrate that randomization inference preserves type I error under model selection while tests based on asymptotic theory may yield invalid results. We also demonstrate that covariate adjustment generally increases power, except at extremely small sample sizes using liberal selection procedures. Although shown within the context of HIV prevention research, our conclusions have important implications for maximizing efficiency and robustness in randomized trials with small samples across disciplines.","inCitations":["8036b34da68d76c5ee6ad125b37d5c90b24c6be1","81a10af6d1cd17ed65976603e916593950ab439f","2172fd75b7e6e8db47d8f709ceda45c60029363a","9f584a7e21a26004195592aac981fe1ee06573ae","fdecc0ffba74485168deb22a7e671fc0dd36ff25"],"title":"Flexible Covariate-adjusted Exact Tests of Randomized Treatment Effects with Application to a Trial of Hiv Education.","doi":"10.1214/13-AOAS679"}

Recently, limited-information goodness-of-fit testing has received increased attention in the psychometrics literature. In contrast to full-information test statistics such as Pearson's X(2) or the likelihood ratio G(2) , these limited-information tests utilize lower-order marginal tables rather than the full contingency table. A notable example is Maydeu-Olivares and colleagues'M2 family of statistics based on univariate and bivariate margins. When the contingency table is sparse, tests based on M2 retain better Type I error rate control than the full-information tests and can be more powerful. While in principle the M2 statistic can be extended to test hierarchical multidimensional item factor models (e.g., bifactor and testlet models), the computation is non-trivial. To obtain M2 , a researcher often has to obtain (many thousands of) marginal probabilities, derivatives, and weights. Each of these must be approximated with high-dimensional numerical integration. We propose a dimension reduction method that can take advantage of the hierarchical factor structure so that the integrals can be approximated far more efficiently. We also propose a new test statistic that can be substantially better calibrated and more powerful than the original M2 statistic when the test is long and the items are polytomous. We use simulations to demonstrate the performance of our new methods and illustrate their effectiveness with applications to real data.","inCitations":["80419ea238f56bd3b2aafdca563e1d06a488ad99","59a99b1b01210d96478e5e17307dd5360cb9a22d","5f88f31187ed5382fc6e150402c179ffa087cef0","1350d0b22a99e2b7290d9189a304e8f1d815bd88","d7523c07e99daa42a06088413bcd86fdb02aa783","e423f117e8d938f4aefe79ff6126162a7a1ed4da","10b373160fb77015792e42c844cc1a550068ec6a","0c295723c62eab30a48bbb601ccf6748251b7dba","a3149d6cd06d17aa38075d5e3590be698779ed60","7d9b1c2333414776f5e8d16878a2c488d03b9904","b6b5a1697ec55a184a4a95eb9d5628f333d4dc6a","873a250599a1b8f006515341dc84f2aa39d90084","da67854474bb74fd60cdce6055988d1f9e57baae","aec45ec67103c961834a5b89c915921047f67459","8359ea1ac24bbd3a68881b50b81ded4c99e8fb95","de7c4c24380009b1a74ee1e8b67e5eeaa54961ec","108e76e569dfe9223f5adbb67a1c8e2da2026547","5cfbadb393256a1c14cfd3673406103761cc7df2","8695bb1ef22ecb68aa8ea141891baebe2064e0c1","55ae51b14070a46a89df9e8f08096d87c09650d4","14d90758838ea03568a90b400c6eeac9f36f8d6a","0cb30ed5ce05eaaa4268c1d17bdc70d7c1db3072","7f3968c4b8d6c92e441abe24219562fb16829f3e","80f7bddac733101ba7d62eda37b6eea3ac8994ea","4f7ee3ab8ed085d5b75cfbe5af8b14ed43d4f343","4e52415121a39ebd71925fc8567c5e7f64588f42","27520f9b82fcf279e247c04144ef2ecf9fb65ea2","7d660849bd221f8a2f450bad372ba2046c39c0a2","f5147906787564f12eabfd04acbd1c9f310da1f6","04d3fa0a79e8da88bc3947f5f7d9180efe1e2a6b","b020627f12b62ff3b6af67cd9a6b2f04e5372528","c2597e4014a5d6a2c6a753c73a2c95ad5f16b6e4","3167fdc76bc49d44d34e8171b4fc71ca69174530","57d55f8f78de57c2822f5c1cf5db9c420b4d8866","1e24fffe135279634cf592561e3742f8c22f0982","9c5f3bd655ec3e76c13ce8c31910209fb49314b9","efe10b430906e27f176cc05126f35d940ef15cbb","62113fecd6f1935d8282fcd99806036bc5efff27","6e8a8bbe1bbd1d17b2d8e11d1a944feceb41c0a1","840d326b569299a8a5abfd3238cb5bd83f5b6671","05c7bc3a06822a7f53f1176f2efd91eb3d308237","a43baf776d976c0df35731a92479376c54cbc84a","d962abdd9e4b1f8441b01346f7281043b47eb60c"],"title":"Limited-information goodness-of-fit testing of hierarchical item factor models.","doi":"10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02050.x"}
