A number of splitting criteria on the classification and regression tree (CART) have been proposed by various authors, and we compare nine criteria through simulations. Comparative studies have been restricted to criteria that suppose the survival model for each terminal node in the final tree as a non-parametric model. As the main results, the criteria using the exponential log-likelihood loss, log-rank test statistics, the deviance residual under the proportional hazard model, or square error of martingale residual are recommended when it appears that the data have constant hazard with the passage of time. On the other hand, when the data are thought to have decreasing hazard with passage of time, the criterion using the two-sample test statistic, or square error of deviance residual would be optimal. Moreover, when the data are thought to have increasing hazard with the passage of time, the criterion using the exponential log-likelihood loss, or impurity that combines observed times and the proportion of censored observations would be the best. We also present the results of an actual medical research to show the utility of survival trees.","inCitations":["e7fc46397c2f312fbce279f3043241db8d4b4578","4545aab3faf9f5bf821a4db912506ad162551a0d","105c0d08267e0c48c3af7d2acb932d122d33f53d"],"title":"Comparison of Splitting Methods on Survival Tree","doi":"10.1515/ijb-2014-0029"}

Performance is subject to change due to a variety of reasons including patient heterogeneity, learning, deteriorating skills due to aging, etc. For instance, we expect inexperienced surgeons to improve their skills with practice. We propose a graphical method to monitor surgical performance that incorporates risk adjustment to account for patient heterogeneity. The procedure gives more weight to recent outcomes and down-weights the influence of outcomes further in the past. The chart is clinically interpretable as it plots an estimate of the failure rate for a \"standard\" patient. The chart also includes a measure of uncertainty in this estimate. We can implement the method using historical data or start from scratch. As the monitoring proceeds, we can base the estimated failure rate on a known risk model or use the observed outcomes to update the risk model as time passes. We illustrate the proposed method with an example from cardiac surgery.","inCitations":["3ba5857bdf72a6e6d3793226dbeeb64c811d5e27","a3fab2a84433850657fea7f997beabf87331ee6f","a8df18573756bb3b385f61aa38962ac5b5b6e728","7ff84905625acb5dde77fa235d093d4ad05ebdc4","d19855dc1014063f102f4de677d2ececc34f4a63"],"title":"Monitoring risk-adjusted medical outcomes allowing for changes over time.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxt057"}

In the document ICH Q8, the design space of a process is presented as the set of factor settings providing satisfactory results. However, ICH Q8 does not propose any practical methodology to define, derive, and compute design space. In parallel, in the last decades, it has been observed that the diversity and the quality of analytical methods have evolved exponentially, allowing substantial gains in selectivity and sensitivity. However, there is still a lack of a rationale toward the development of robust separation methods in a systematic way. Applying ICH Q8 to analytical methods provides a methodology for predicting a region of the space of factors in which results will be reliable. Combining design of experiments and Bayesian standard multivariate regression, an identified form of the predictive distribution of a new response vector has been identified and used, under noninformative as well as informative prior distributions of the parameters. From the responses and their predictive distribution, various critical quality attributes can be easily derived. This Bayesian framework was then extended to the multicriteria setting to estimate the predictive probability that several critical quality attributes will be jointly achieved in the future use of an analytical method. An example based on a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method is given. For this example, a constrained sampling scheme was applied to ensure the modeled responses have desirable properties.","inCitations":["97d85148d2808b74cd4a006a7aa41d0582e04e16","2cbeece8926b543ebf9b4a799df20ac80001f919","54ca92d4a17d4f25d93505376b44c6fcfade139b","080cedbd9a10d6782a9d2f756bf392e2c61babbe","3569ff8600424c6baeed1d7f01414381bce9c8eb","167119dc22e9aac985bad0bc14022b330176b8c1","732c6a7a4cb2f68fb6fe431713ce4aebaf8c31eb","18477a80523dee70a0902178ff138e07909f22f8"],"title":"A Bayesian design space for analytical methods based on multivariate models and predictions.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2013.834922"}

They may sometimes be the only option to study a new treatment, for example in small populations and rare diseases. In early phase trials, where data are often sparse, good statistical inference and subsequent decision-making can be challenging. Inferences from simple pooling or stratification are known to be inferior to hierarchical modeling methods, which build on exchangeable strata parameters and allow borrowing information across strata. However, the standard exchangeability (EX) assumption bears the risk of too much shrinkage and excessive borrowing for extreme strata. We propose the exchangeability-nonexchangeability (EXNEX) approach as a robust mixture extension of the standard EX approach. It allows each stratum-specific parameter to be exchangeable with other similar strata parameters or nonexchangeable with any of them. While EXNEX computations can be performed easily with standard Bayesian software, model specifications and prior distributions are more demanding and require a good understanding of the context. Two case studies from phases I and II (with three and four strata) show promising results for EXNEX. Data scenarios reveal tempered degrees of borrowing for extreme strata, and frequentist operating characteristics perform well for estimation (bias, mean-squared error) and testing (less type-I error inflation).","inCitations":["512ef99cce2ff6f449736cce06f468cf762d9446","472aa222180a9a95ab72145108eb3e66e071001e","80ead2efe0cb6571cd63552277738c0667818a1e","e7987d8eb694cd2f774d2b068a402de675b4e8c4","3923ca24224d7c583ce40d1ba4cb79a6ad86bb96","5aa81e78fe151f5a9d337b4e17d238c3427f10e2","ca2f03dc18fd35283cc2cfcf0cdea42e57ac8ecb","db1d99ce84f63343a6b30d5971b14ce313010473","42d7c41c025a40c87af153dff849ecfc8f4a28ed","e971948a2d338bc76f1aed347ab5f6ef63259f88","defaa701eddee7513d6d64b1af8b587deaaad9b8","34d17e40dc7b15bfcbd2b59804b99098141bbdce","2d30f732ea0ef1dea3c8d1f62fde155d836ebfa8","ef192e23b1d76fc674f294c0b5b52525c8e880ff","b95685d9d28110e1c6782d15bcbe54f32dec58db","407913ac8bc80632abf2a6d9a826959753a4e97d","8484be05b4d17eb466f6b1098e559f82127daabf","7e05bb31756b8787151aaaffe82ec9f6bbc79094","0919eb4ec8c337efe5052e3a2e7b6d2d13c4243b"],"title":"Robust exchangeability designs for early phase clinical trials with multiple strata.","doi":"10.1002/pst.1730"}

The development is mainly based on Schönemann and Steiger's regression score components, but it can also be applied to the factor score coefficients. It is shown that the rotation of factor score predictors has no impact on the covariance matrix reproduced from the corresponding regression component patterns. Thus, regression score components or factor score coefficients can be rotated in order to obtain the required properties. This idea is the basis for MR factor score predictors, which are computed by means of a partial Procrustes rotation towards a target pattern representing the interesting properties of a confirmatory factor model. Two examples demonstrate the construction of MR factor score predictors reflecting specific constraints of a factor model.","inCitations":["3b608f7e55da239b943d682eda0c9b75025e4d6f","8601c8b1c94bbf777b7f937d09807290130ce2e1","fa2221d3d858977932bc3a7602898ab5801e545b","73ea5a528436747562ab26b54acede7af58a6f46"],"title":"Model-related factor score predictors for confirmatory factor analysis.","doi":"10.1348/000711008X336146"}

After addressing the computational challenges, we propose possible solutions to the difficult problem of transforming a qualitative scientific null hypothesis, such as \"this voxel does not enhance,\" to a well-defined and numerically testable null hypothesis based on the existing data. We call such procedure \"soft null\" hypothesis testing as opposed to the standard \"hard null\" hypothesis testing. This problem is fundamentally different from: (1) finding testing statistics when a quantitative null hypothesis is given; (2) clustering using a mixture distribution; or (3) setting a reasonable threshold with a parametric null assumption. Supplementary materials are available online.","inCitations":["affe8af86454218f7e52a1ca59e0913ceadfcfcf","afc540fbcf3b27f6dbcc496c83011a24d20a6d0f","0a662b27b45a83ff301654f1bb2c8b6612c57be6"],"title":"Soft Null Hypotheses: A Case Study of Image Enhancement Detection in Brain Lesions.","doi":"10.1080/10618600.2015.1023396"}

Fahrmeir & Kaufmann (1985, Ann. Stat., 13, 1) present mild conditions under which the MLEs in GLiMs are asymptotically normal. Unfortunately, limited study has appeared for the special case of binomial response models beyond the familiar logit and probit links, and for more general links such as the complementary log-log link, and the less well-known complementary log link. We verify the asymptotic normality conditions of the MLEs for these models under the assumption of a fixed number of experimental groups and present a simple set of conditions for any twice differentiable monotone link function. We also study the quality of the approximation for constructing asymptotic Wald confidence regions. Our results show that for small sample sizes with certain link functions the approximation can be problematic, especially for cases where the parameters are close to the boundary of the parameter space.","inCitations":["cb068363ec80ed37e3ffdc0efbe1c1cdb7df5a73","bed139e3a20ef4dc44548d61f7dbe470f6414978"],"title":"Maximum likelihood estimation with binary-data regression models: small-sample and large-sample features.","doi":""}

This procedure is shown to control the family-wise error rate in a strong sense. The performance of the procedure is studied by simulation for different parameter settings. The conclusions of the simulation study are stated in terms of the power, family-wise error rate and lack of power.","inCitations":["4779d4de49aa6e1c4621fdafd34b92845aae1419","09089bf8741ad3ad017386b047247f4ebda0b887","ca92517ab120af31e1b90f70e91c71213fb1b60c","8d05182283e8486c00abe52eebf37701dfc45108","415174c7e095015e31f34630b63ab8bf69dff5e7","e484ec634199c6e37006010f05ee71cf54b11063"],"title":"On identifying effective and superior drug combinations via Holm's procedure based on the min tests.","doi":"10.1080/10543400802622469"}

The data sets obtained by these methods can be large with complex inter-relationships, but the most appropriate statistical analysis for handling this data is often uncertain--precisely because of the exploratory nature of the way the data are collected. We present an example from a clinical trial using magnetic resonance imaging to assess changes in atherosclerotic plaques following treatment with a tool compound with established clinical benefit. We compared two specific approaches to handle the correlations due to physical location and repeated measurements: two-level and four-level multilevel models. The two methods identified similar structural variables, but higher level multilevel models had the advantage of explaining a greater proportion of variation, and the modeling assumptions appeared to be better satisfied.","inCitations":["6b604b35695f57de36fd8d315cbd101a94ee2d0b"],"title":"Modeling data with structural and temporal correlation using lower level and higher level multilevel models.","doi":"10.1002/pst.479"}

Recently, social network studies have focused a great deal of attention on random graph models of networks whose nodes represent individual social actors and whose edges represent a specified relationship between the actors. Most inference for social network models assumes that the presence or absence of all possible links is observed, that the information is completely reliable, and that there are no measurement (e.g., recording) errors. This is clearly not true in practice, as much network data is collected though sample surveys. In addition even if a census of a population is attempted, individuals and links between individuals are missed (i.e., do not appear in the recorded data). In this paper we develop the conceptual and computational theory for inference based on sampled network information. We first review forms of network sampling designs used in practice. We consider inference from the likelihood framework, and develop a typology of network data that reflects their treatment within this frame. We then develop inference for social network models based on information from adaptive network designs.

It is a measure of the association between the correlated cause-specific failure times within a cluster. The joint cumulative incidence function can be expressed as a function of the marginal cumulative incidence functions and the cross-odds ratio. Assuming that the marginal cumulative incidence functions follow a generalized semiparametric model, this paper studies the parametric regression modeling of the cross-odds ratio. A set of estimating equations are proposed for the unknown parameters and the asymptotic properties of the estimators are explored. Non-parametric estimation of the cross-odds ratio is also discussed. The proposed procedures are applied to the Danish twin data to model the associations between twins in their times to natural menopause and to investigate whether the association differs among monozygotic and dizygotic twins and how these associations have changed over time.","inCitations":["39886aaeef1cd158b59f82d163f86c2ca5e3ef85","7e403adf2de998338158b0fcf99240112cde8dad","8a853a9ae91503e9740f9f6c05786f420ff7b502","555b0da5c5c85ad372eccd04ce62b5737f318481","7eacf455122b9cdcf1b3552d93f7e2878822ac5a"],"title":"On cross-odds ratio for multivariate competing risks data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs017"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Mathematics"],"year":2008,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology","paperAbstract":"The most commonly employed item selection rule in a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is that of selecting the item with the maximum Fisher information for the estimated trait level. This means a highly unbalanced distribution of item-exposure rates, a high overlap rate among examinees and, for item bank management, strong pressure to replace items with a high discrimination parameter in the bank. An alternative for mitigating these problems involves, at the beginning of the test, basing item selection mainly on randomness. As the test progresses, the weight of information in the selection increases. In the present work we study, for two selection rules, the progressive methods (Revuelta & Ponsoda, 1998) and the proportional method (Segall, 2004a), different functions that define the weight of the random component according to the position in the test of the item to be administered. The functions were tested in simulated item banks and in an operative bank. We found that both the progressive and the proportional methods tolerate a high weight of the random component with minimal or zero loss of accuracy, while bank security and maintenance are improved.","inCitations":["ecc33ebacc38c2849c5230edd9541ef69a9c7812","ec3fa50b4ebf9bf30572f39a491ecdc98b52611b","3df81a8d7100ac7e4f9696e7bec256cfa4f4b340","b9b898a0e6d6aef7f8d27fc8aa24920d09b838a6","6cdc1d225523a38899d214bcb53a840cf654751a","13ea79478fb544be72c3c424db7dfed3f6f19120","4caf614eee0c2581b4812c87373a02390bc2d1f4","5f8c7f2752b7a9965ef5f58e6e34b2c56abdc78a","2afc9ebe5c55c5f349e8d49f5906b4714da17483","46e32adbb27a53a09737fa1e9f3273df3b7de914","66f0dde18b8196391368d479dd27197c4468caf8","6677fae12226835940923c3fb1203b685978eecd","e7833a09d266abf199a933c95e86618c46f934fc","b8477f43cb0cc84bd22cc9e740f296b21c0d14ad","bd9440f5c3e03520ccf0cbfd8cd5fc13f28711b2","6315b8550fe44141318780a49e8798046ea4f8d7"],"title":"Incorporating randomness in the Fisher information for improving item-exposure control in CATs.","doi":"10.1348/000711007X230937"}

For example, they can estimate heritability of complex traits, allowing for both polygenic and sparse models; and by incorporating external genomic data into the priors, they can increase power and yield new biological insights. However, these methods require access to individual genotypes and phenotypes, which are often not easily available. Here we provide a framework for performing these analyses without individual-level data. Specifically, we introduce a \"Regression with Summary Statistics\" (RSS) likelihood, which relates the multiple regression coefficients to univariate regression results that are often easily available. The RSS likelihood requires estimates of correlations among covariates (SNPs), which also can be obtained from public databases. We perform Bayesian multiple regression analysis by combining the RSS likelihood with previously proposed prior distributions, sampling posteriors by Markov chain Monte Carlo. In a wide range of simulations RSS performs similarly to analyses using the individual data, both for estimating heritability and detecting associations. We apply RSS to a GWAS of human height that contains 253,288 individuals typed at 1.06 million SNPs, for which analyses of individual-level data are practically impossible. Estimates of heritability (52%) are consistent with, but more precise, than previous results using subsets of these data. We also identify many previously unreported loci that show evidence for association with height in our analyses.

Given the availability of flexible software for analyzing longitudinal sequences of unequal length, implementation of likelihood-based MAR analyses is not limited by computational considerations. While such analyses are valid under the comparatively weak assumption of MAR, the possibility of data missing not at random (MNAR) is difficult to rule out. It is argued, however, that MNAR analyses are, themselves, surrounded with problems and therefore, rather than ignoring MNAR analyses altogether or blindly shifting to them, their optimal place is within sensitivity analysis.

To provide as complete a picture as possible, we extend the analysis to all the main spatial models governed by matrix exponentials comparing them with their spatial autoregressive counterparts. We propose a new implementation of Bayesian parameter estimation for the MESS model with vague prior distributions, which is shown to be precise and computationally efficient. Our implementations also account for spatially lagged regressors. We further allow for location-specific heterogeneity, which we model by including spatial splines. We conclude by comparing the performances of the different model specifications in applications to a real data set and by running simulations. Both the applications and the simulations suggest that the spatial splines are a flexible and efficient way to account for spatial heterogeneities governed by unknown mechanisms.","inCitations":["dc7dbe34d76f87181541b2177e21c433abd9085e","dc51d193872516b2474e5b76c44ba1d3eb25895a"],"title":"Is a matrix exponential specification suitable for the modeling of spatial correlation structures?","doi":"10.1016/j.spasta.2017.04.003"}

The procedure is based on item response theory modelling. As an example, the approach is worked out in detail in conjunction with item response data modelled using the partial credit and generalized partial credit models. Simulation studies are carried out to assess the extent to which the bias caused by ignoring the missing-data mechanism can be reduced. Finally, the feasibility of the procedure is demonstrated using data from a study to calibrate a medical disability scale.","inCitations":["e8e4b8feed5baff71e65e9f8fef157d15eac6479","7e17d29e3dc13989bcb9f5e225dc50dd0bda95dd","9180f79b0b2fd7b730a0e5cabd11fac36f46f24c","8379f1d7c109ce516d63ededd02e98e0c1e6e79a","7023f34362bddb44d09d7653ece83657f645c842","7156179f5c8ec909cd4a6ba375b2ed42a04d26b8","f316a308e266691c9a8ae71234f2e57fd0149676","fbaf66e42ff7ce1887ef224f18036c2cffcf8ec4","ac1cf564d62183f66e2bed23599de540ee26acbc","0cb10e2598dc1b1875d127869fe119e46a99f796","c787c7457670c4e174684911bc37609a929b3205","a157472bb8e60c75507301cc028fc59c54f5d05c","2f56f3fcc2265ade75b73d8565dc94ea0abc6751","e61cdd57dd8943702654fe3121baef2f258afa36","1d44aa33a468aa5f719e3cb2ae5a7ae56949a303","926659465b967e126b58ed7f57221a91d17fddfd","d5a0a23b402d7753c67dd8415620bfa1b8bd48d5","e1e971dfe44ed3fe5cf9602a326b0ddab972f228","cfd1f77dbecacb3590e86f0b2a2907322578a33c","54dd96bca3e6e364a364133c63fae89d98e09e65","0802ed2fc9c37dbbce5b6817de613dcbb07e1a7a","9f3af536d7bb8dc9a5cd802e9231e110ea550c1c","86c03a245ac488ba0ae04686a47768fa8c7f3386","23f2080e7008d802b2e3574ccb632ba28eda60f4","4ef6b24003e2c468120844ce6279fb70ca777504","4ebd8f886f0a0f016a31c29917069c432fd38003","576be54e606363be40d0ef26b1ac7dfcaa77f424","9655822b04b5e25b7af656bf6d499b0dbeab329a","2ad08fa1638be853e1b715f0c562ee7069fcb57a","fb71c1e86a5b969ea39e77fccf6c168c363baa84","04216d6a2ddddedcf60b397fa5f7e9675e88806c","1f01033ba3034bc2d41b5f7ba78178fceb8b5a38","195eacce620abf04c010d4529a38314131db7f35","a8bcc075bfb475b689f182107c15180199e84050","17dee6e6e417224a30f8ffe88e5e487e86b63ab9","c36b01f8470d04cca1353c352c39c3977144b730","609b5d282fa30d491d1934f340a22f2052b9626d","1ea6499e0caf8c30dc65e91ca3e8beac0bd8fa09","0220c8c29d81a4f977498e9ef9b2bfee8b3369a6","f844eb51fdc3d181906a3024623c3c1946da9476","48d343b0375bc83e6fdaf3ae47f6123957deff61","b8f63a5642587b26500ea2346d226b83d361aef5","4cfcda4742effdd4c3cf646946f1ee5c9e41d869","685a97d1a6ff1a3aba673ce8e54c7456f0d02194","d899c0cd624f666b4f9451b3772c43c0e7116511","30a37e30db9c325ab467b72aca2076796ca2b922","eb9a7c6463748c038709d8cfec1e6ab886ef564a","354818cebfb297113f40a3bf172e22da72d23f18","674b0f1b146ff86b32500e5cf33adbc5c9945444","353d0b9496add4fcdc55b0b20d1b5f6943101337","07e2f911b19e6b85de09bdc5d61bb1d6a2a694e6","93322a812256670aa4fb1560dd58104a248e9e92","2dbc3c380248e1090d7fac5cf431da8c45f1b4fb","a2ff003cb0793883e12092377b36403571c701e1","d997b6dda05e6cb2edd7d72815af9905550dae5e","eb477a81f160b4912097ba36f9fba35320f59377","e10f2ea0ade5232270e7420060c349017b4adc0b","3fbce898a0ebb8d304d1747991b227e602ee4acd"],"title":"Modelling non-ignorable missing-data mechanisms with item response theory models.","doi":"10.1348/000711005X47168"}

While development and optimization of analytical procedure following QbD principles have been largely discussed and described, the place of analytical procedure validation in this framework has not been clarified. This article aims at showing that analytical procedure validation is fully integrated into the QbD paradigm and is an essential step in developing analytical procedures that are effectively fit for purpose. Adequate statistical methodologies have also their role to play: such as design of experiments, statistical modeling, and probabilistic statements. The outcome of analytical procedure validation is also an analytical procedure design space, and from it, control strategy can be set.","inCitations":["20d6c7f537273ec7ef3fc830df1974d944013d64","c9cdb7ec4272c0108a1c07979f0f686d3c598b2a","3569ff8600424c6baeed1d7f01414381bce9c8eb","4526401c8aabf5952c16e6da14c27df43fea5ef5","31c00396e1b0f198caf5da2fd3f11821d7aa60e6","2379e12683f6e3c009435938a5d7b29ee555fd54","cc159e57d04f21673e893cd3cdbc711ddd9ce726","a5773f5ecb8d13acf72981951466d9151ce4054a"],"title":"Analytical procedure validation and the quality by design paradigm.","doi":"10.1080/10543406.2014.971176"}

A DTR is a set of decision rules, one per interval of treatment, where each decision is a function of treatment and covariate history that returns a recommended treatment. Q-learning is a popular method from the reinforcement learning literature that has recently been applied to estimate DTRs. While, in principle, Q-learning can be used for both randomized and observational data, the focus in the literature thus far has been exclusively on the randomized treatment setting. We extend the method to incorporate measured confounding covariates, using direct adjustment and a variety of propensity score approaches. The methods are examined under various settings including non-regular scenarios. We illustrate the methods in examining the effect of breastfeeding on vocabulary testing, based on data from the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial.","inCitations":["0578aea6c5758dee88312f393d063486bd3e322c","0e739d92688a413b0eeb693817543372bd4acc7e","eed2fd6e55c61e9de6631f7fd987e094b0e58530","858effd10b711ad6c86eff9c32cdc0bc320a6e1a","fba18acdfb6a0be3f4e174bd95663bdcfa119d58","b0680decae33bcba664a761663b99168b4f9aa39","c0e906e772cff7fe4a031509128adc565dc2c603","3583f2a253dd7b910c265da34eaddaf00d38dbfe","847092dc01d5b5f65b596cd880e906dbeb60134c","574e8ceee80a6907f1918c7e647325f74f5530e3","59e7551f5b6ffde5cc9f8f2e29bd3c6fae1f4155","e5d164890b6930256f84639be76ba0b4807169d4","5248380a6ece676c23fb8eba3d747e72f8108033","ee08e5f50ee8d9674518f5f6f62cfac73ce8055b","cab32454fdfcf495d021f1d0b961e18cf31532cc","c69b0475f05c15e6af09de66fbf9c041431d5199","d290797a05041405bfd179c397e571cc3dba5374","fd2c23dde1e7d408c6d29c54a796489f55f37b19","ba7c853734edb1e9548a05ffa71c15c235037798","e568a265747151e23e6db7ae64437dd854385fcb","4170b59e19369d5704df22c92f9fb5666c60e184","43ef6f75c7b0aaf61cbebf7796041bacc27a4b34","6ceabbf89f548d72ddd7aa20155e0897e41e756d"],"title":"Q-learning for estimating optimal dynamic treatment rules from observational data.","doi":"10.1002/cjs.11162"}

Factor analyses were carried out on ADAS-COG and ADAS-NONCOG item scores from the most recent and largest (n = 663) placebo-controlled, multicenter, 30-week study (970-61) of tacrine in patients with AD conducted by the clinical research group at Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research. Through factor analyses the primary dimensions of variation in the ADAS-COG and ADAS-NONCOG were defined. Obliquely rotated three principal factors of ADAS-COG and three principal factors of ADAS-NONCOG have been interpreted as three cardinal features of cognitive function corresponding to memory, language, and praxis, and three cardinal features of noncognitive function corresponding to agitation, depression, and lack of concentration. Reliably defined factors of ADAS-COG enabled comparisons of longitudinal changes in cognitive dysfunction. Factor scores at week 30, adjusted to baseline factor scores, were used to compare the effects of tacrine with those of placebo on cognitive cardinal features. Additionally, the effect of concurrent depression on cardinal features of cognitive dysfunction was evaluated by gender.","inCitations":["6e96cf8a6592d3c2ea810f2fabf72c3c0681afc8","1d53e80a5954140f5a8e4c246cf8f1269bd09eea","0e6d444f7636bf3d95b8f8aaabf0a97eadce08ce","db47e053a41ce440a77bc3e9beb9f5662b68359b","df163728c21297fe57649fdd400bdb8ae6c9f9b2"],"title":"The cardinal features of cognitive and noncognitive dysfunction and the differential efficacy of tacrine in Alzheimer's disease patients.","doi":"10.1080/10543409608835155"}

The complexity of the study requires the development of methods that can simultaneously incorporate: (1) multiple functional (and scalar) regressors; (2) longitudinal outcome and predictor measurements per patient; (3) Gaussian or non-Gaussian outcomes; and (4) missing values within functional predictors. We propose two versions of a new method, longitudinal functional principal components regression (PCR). These methods extend the well-known functional PCR and allow for different effects of subject-specific trends in curves and of visit-specific deviations from that trend. The new methods are compared with existing approaches, and the most promising techniques are used for analyzing the tractography data.","inCitations":["924308e7cf5c11aa1e5482e237d198fa131dccf1","34f7d4944f41157da4c22fbddbd7b7498cf2fd46","459a53dcc4dad1d28c7313df349674f41ed2a0b3","f6d91a81f442057f3f18e8479b36a17785fe8f5e","94128e75477d1b188dbcc780fe1a16054f84d10e","e84e8e24966143d52ae98b9afdac6ef2fa8aeaed","017fd8127564c37de16c7181e9587da7d4ffea67","c4cb22d1b44991a9f3c17014b2831b38cf8a59b1","e0697717ad2c81593ae3ee04b0f6164855096896","86aa31ceb300683c7d329a750b18dbec940dd68e","1323d61085b26846269e032f49e0249676f5a026","f60f23bdc2ec695224e7df30ee3770b0c02e4028","1fd11283f29d092ef00183e31c59dfa988ae1bd5","8f70fe08eeb9fde2a30a3249a355b4e3e2590b12","6666473c926665eecc741a0dd29e1b329d273e38","ef5de29f749dcc5b596a3c6c5a77b1c11323faf7","d0d20d51555c3e31661823180ff351322d547e05","b3a2670dc08d3d26fb3616a78526d03d62293957","d3decced316848b42ab6998a9acc14ceac5ff594","9ebb1b58dc9cb62bf6f7c33396930208f15584af","833a43e2bebb8332a00cab43c363d571b44fb209"],"title":"Longitudinal scalar-on-functions regression with application to tractography data.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxs051"}

Previous results concerning bounds for controlled direct effects rely on monotonicity relationships between the treatment, mediator and the outcome themselves; the results presented in this paper instead assume that monotonicity relationships hold between the unmeasured confounding variable or variables and the treatment, mediator and outcome. Whereas prior results give bounds that contain the null hypothesis of no direct effect, the results presented here will in many instances yield bounds that do not contain the null hypothesis of no direct effect. For contexts in which a set of variables intercepts all paths between a treatment and an outcome, it is possible to provide a definition for a controlled mediated effect. We discuss the identification of these controlled mediated effects; the bounds for controlled direct effects are applicable also to controlled mediated effects. An example is given to illustrate how the results in the paper can be used to draw inferences about direct and mediated effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding variables.","inCitations":["40e00c944ca01028aee3d6741d06869fd5a17f09","6abc693a5693b372e3a40fae961448b3fe75ee42","a55fd138c719fed5b9467fdecd0e57c66c31dede","1ecd4588a28f9386e3cfb1f10cb9f381a602cc8c","71a34f2e263f303b14d1fbf882a330edd443c413","c3ade5ca2ba2181d950860e617c16028869d0595","1c7ac4adb61edadf47f475485dfeb101369b2696","793d675269f5def7f3fec81f0c4f30228285405b","88f087fa6b6100b03caf3d8e5b5214f3d36569e7","787ff00ffb300fb2095d5153411346df8e86e475","f8e056bc125a8329a051fb079958489aeda7e96e","32f3c54efd72e36123a7e6d45cb784d01e09973f","21cd2630e8282154fe03f2fbeeb5eacd4c6b6153","3c7c29486ce668c1888a1c8214a9914afab0c17a","88d69dc92c3acbeea7270bc7bbcdd29be69a5e52","5eadbe9cdc0bcd51a38a03abcecc7456b8e55eb3","5dba30c906420351d57d80e18e625d4c18e951d6","d55088f457134ad25415c2e484636c6fdfcd65d4","3c117cef9c44e85fc619ad27db8fd37a7de58149","98f7ef5950b71d7ecc15fb9397fe9b7f8d16e900","13b5212a0b95332827a932863aed8e79242d7ac8","b95483a755bb22ae9b88cfdfc650c0fe31101c25","b08ea667d63a21a1d0a83edaf2d23f54f583ea8e","e71cd205bb89e54b51fd2a5edf2dc3db7b14b73b","1601c81e4dec39e7b6088cc520ef327802f4bc41","78d6cf71f20ca359680175369fb755be8c218de4","7a4d809b3e94654f77b26fc6c24c6d0f040b2e7c"],"title":"Controlled direct and mediated effects: definition, identification and bounds.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9469.2010.00722.x"}

The algorithm builds and selects models based on user-defined criteria for model selection, and utilizes a loss function-based estimation procedure to distinguish between different model fits. In addition, the algorithm selects models based on cross-validation methodology to avoid \"over-fitting\" data. The cvDSA routine is an R software package available for download. An alternative R-package (DSA) based on the same principles as the cvDSA routine (i.e., cross-validation, loss function), but one that is faster and with additional refinements for selection and estimation of conditional means, is also available for download. Analyses of real and simulated data were conducted to demonstrate the use of these algorithms, and to compare MSMs where the causal effects were assumed (i.e., investigator-defined), with MSMs selected by the cvDSA. The package was used also to select models for the nuisance parameter (treatment) model to estimate the MSM parameters with inverse-probability of treatment weight (IPTW) estimation.

However, in some situations this model, in its standard form, does pose computational problems. For example, when dealing with crossed random-effects models, the estimation of the variance components becomes a non-trivial task if only one observation is available for each cross-classified level. Pseudolikelihood ideas have been used in the context of binary data with standard generalized linear multilevel models. However, even in this case the problem of the estimation of the variance remains non-trivial. In this paper, we first propose a method to fit a crossed random-effects model with two levels and continuous outcomes, borrowing ideas from conditional linear mixed-effects model theory. We also propose a crossed random-effects model for binary data combining ideas of conditional logistic regression with pseudolikelihood estimation. We apply this method to a case study with data coming from the field of psychometrics and study a series of items (responses) crossed with participants. A simulation study assesses the operational characteristics of the method.","inCitations":["f1a86e04374df089ad21e33c73acce1aabedd3b4","d5cb0eafbcd9c3bc3d7d9199585d6ebb14662d67","e16e9326927a2bd77579f633854200f03fd7e5a5"],"title":"Conditional mixed models with crossed random effects.","doi":"10.1348/000711006X110562"}

We use this essential property of averaging in regression of the DNA microarray data, which poses the challenge of having far more features than samples. In this paper, we introduce a two-step procedure that combines (1) hierarchical clustering and (2) Lasso. By averaging the genes within the clusters obtained from hierarchical clustering, we define supergenes and use them to fit regression models, thereby attaining concise interpretation and accuracy. Our methods are supported with theoretical justifications and demonstrated on simulated and real data sets.","inCitations":["62d6d13d5c8782a3bd6930158f1189a974ec7f7f","957090575c88babbf6b5e2fc677378d065c17601","62ab40a0b29914ea8928ff3ee2e363bfcf880bf5","eba75b4d1770e60f2f12c394313d98366079567e","e0bdb812d080e5e8ce0db97f284037adf1e9e9c4","f4a207b91414378e64cead9155f4dd5ce16bd82b","aaf39ff772f00c82d4bfc26d838387af610acd68","ad70d2cde877babdd0511eb6a12381c01f654b15","5024adfec4b6c00fd0e7bc45c7efefee2d9b93e6","96b6d41fb093fa48c2c33c31087aceff5b4ce8ad","c884e908859d6b600a08bcade403d840c79c94bf","c366e08343b8a7013ebb1a9d115dd99ee1218a75","bb99a33d5d6c0c2d012157b1ed9e58e253942648","bc1ab6c5d8a92185270a1555edfcc3841cfe8ded","175ad71b9bed5cb09caa2b3263fc3a6758fb6d78","824cfa2171174f687938d8e393a921cfe7d81b77","42a7bc216b081b25837d4e4b707f7216e3b606eb","d68fdcd96cc4b9414d57a3f7217595490daf484b","52f63823082d3f02578726388db4f417c4bdd76b","b5a0c522ac3c938c33f13b6fa496740eedd72c4c","641839697407c375f67ccbb95fea45bd0f0f6753","12df80571b4e4ea23800da1396e2a9a49da5c209","92d8a607ddc10394720dc6511abab694976c67d2","9ad72865a588e0f4cbd2e02a83fcd65ba746f5e1","ab2c4cdf92e37cebc27c9cc3f75420d7bb690f8c","7cacefdbea566ea1ba7b52541430041560de6706","eb760ea5c476516b7951fa63f1cc48a5804a0e84","34484968a3ba4396f1ba6935dce47b1c631c1b66","b5f821455b1b25568b6dc805a1d1755333a8d656","fe88308887b5acef8d7853be42ec46558d613e77","f64bdaf56361126aab804795883a0eca24dc1155","4ba27b132755200d1ab273a39595d93ad91ec7df","91cd1d6ca6b3787478cd572c6d064c7f89f9d17f","03a630cd8f7e9a3b67216d354e13c7713dfa63fb","55b0f75e2f0b4057ca1e8ccfa84a04b338fb0258","a12be3386d1e4d5a621482546d7a85468b0b0812","20394d84caef1f543b1986c229317757d88eeab8","76814c0c3b8a2527086b6e5a13df3923230755a9","4539c81d9c93d21d95ae7acc13d0c30b26913c74","16be505a697b47dad717ac0853434e5831880702","5b2855b300e2dd96716d0c86231e598d11349950","6f85aef7dd3bf4e1093dcc218bb8f7555df82cee","e8ac069a43f26ea0ae6510ff2c053847914dc1e0","70d6469ba9dd530d294957059412e9b1868d763e","ab1981591e273b272472ccc196d9869f391c823f","62982eda37cce93148a4369ce5b22dd3c8e744dc","1cbfb48f339cb9281a76e83b342d526c46d3e168","759bef5df17f5682820964433e9e25d09c42a944","06382f14850c7978f384986263242fa3691dd4c3","678cb7587105de5107f9d0833af30a818150c729","7056fc8b2f5304680b66113559e03732ea8cf8e8","ade04f5743fd0c1ec37d049ca0effedc7443465b","66d6e3b7f7b4a677cb09be44dec4e99636ad1e4a","cf216fcd4cf537e53b9ed4f46e59c445e845cfc5","9a96b7fab89222209d70cb64ae3e98cf36b8b78c","44e4c442c10444f4a48d7407695dd0705107e2fe","5c87cf3c0fc5a33bc75590b873e7fa94c05ccabf","1b53a99633f5f1486e8c37d14d0a13e8c1948bc9","f3befb449214b067674d0aaff287837422fb9233","c71445b0d41f0865344e76a26894b4f58b0766fc","84364e41289170b4d007b6d7254c55f320ef3e65","9eadbb48fc64e998ed0c4033f0fcb138613e297c","6f83755c961579c891a63579a7a5a3bdf5df51e8","1755bbf1ae01521f53927a8361f70e81cb15412c","79edc3440b071267d40c9e8983068e28378d7898","1979ba578e4907730503093ef96076771fa93ad8","a9fc0062c33c0f5e678276b6d6872152b2979c6b","b9c44032cdb0b6abdd0172f879c66815b541bd4a","022b8f9007d379fb8badb3ed6c9beaf83209f05e","040c1f0dff1bf6c4c6f2bbfa975f587f01ff9e3a","8d6081993c9a65f333597582e6b60e7ab593b8ac","7ea0726bc7b12fb325e9015a53bc8df845bd2881","faf3e0b48f0221ccb026d9ebc6a51b511f19a827","d516ca0eb162302bf8b21f9bf8ff88eca4005b8d","c6dee0359f42d0096b2326e6ce12cbb05613f0c3","1e063754c63be4e828dd8a02afde0f08361b84d4","70fac22833aa8323a9fa35655fa5993bd2da7107","b1c2b46ba478d6a9526c98e1ace0541173a06bbe","aea181ec80ebf8dc2225dfd1c929886155a1f624","18d33674fdcb4b587801bffba896bfd217d05e89","c6c1bbc83d4ba688685448d4ab039cb7a7a68d56","573229ac65e697c75b2110b2e8691e0c854a1845","d56c6aecb1c40a7ae0a5a2524387dd5a7f5a8c25","c8c3ca86502336af534a9a6a8346e5bd0c93c950","1264602730b998ec2651c0cf162b4abfafc54518","0f83c419502e97ec6f70871c4dc1eddf92a4e746","9e95b44f1e0b14cabb1a3e2780545d24e642b9f7","1b429b226b7a7f36d0541bee7c5096f8198657f1","82c34c84f3f58c3cb6b4e125db6213df6e9b992d","8c8684b2322e5dca1d07f08578b82a0b38fd3a44","674785897d1f687a9b9af0dce3d692ffe6cee1a8","4bf046283c1f71c6d0e3919a442fc24a1f4cc9ac","92c070e854434c3b6785f4b5847645386e2d36b6","3eb05745beea40eaa646d4bdba949922e1881020"],"title":"Averaged gene expressions for regression.","doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxl002"}
