The iron layer between the ZnO layers facilitates the change in the resistance of the device through the oxidation of the iron at the ZnO/Fe interface, thus generating oxygen vacancies and providing electrons from the redox reaction between γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. The main mechanisms of conduction include Poole–Frenkel emission and Fowler–Nordhein tunneling with the ion migration, oxygen vacancies, and redox reactions of iron oxides (γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4). The response of the device to sequential voltage pulses in terms of variation in resistance, RERASE/RWRITE ratio, retention time, and control of the resistance state, through control of the applied voltage, was also evaluated.","inCitations":["2df484cb86a48cecc3cf984a197ba00ad0e8f478","31f626fd43bc9c04504bdf2b110b74543f77b3bb"],"title":"A novel structure ZnO-Fe-ZnO thin film memristor","doi":"10.1016/j.mssp.2018.06.016"}

PDT is capable to induce different cell death mechanisms in vitro, triggered in a dose-dependent manner. Relationships between PDT and apoptosis or necrosis induction are well-known, but other cell death mechanisms triggered after PDT are less understood. Here we present our results in p53-deficient human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells subjected to sublethal PDT treatments (mortality about 40%) using Zn(II)-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) incorporated into liposomes. We obtained a rapid metaphase blockage of cells that also showed clearly altered configurations of the mitotic spindle. Cell cycle arrest was followed by aneuploidisation and cell death with apoptotic morphology. Apoptosis was also confirmed by occurrence of PARP cleavage and Bax translocation to mitochondria. These features are components of the cell death mechanism known as mitotic catastrophe and represent, to our knowledge, the first description of this cell death modality after PDT with ZnPc.","inCitations":["d8b1923fc507a8c7bed46f2e405e773140b98636","570b47151267a14e9492aef193137a3e34345f75"],"title":"Mitotic catastrophe induced in HeLa cells by photodynamic treatment with Zn(II)-phthalocyanine.","doi":"10.3892/ijo.32.6.1189"}

Towards this end, we aimed to understand the therapeutic effectiveness of a polymer based vaccine approach at enhancing the anti-tumor responses in a tumor-bearing mouse model. While we and others have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of PLGA based systems in delivering antigen etc., studies scarcely focus on understanding the immunological mechanisms of polymer based therapies in tumor bearing treatment models. Considering tumors modulate the immune system and consequently the efficacy of therapies, understanding treatment mechanisms in the presence of tumor will help lead to more efficacious treatment options. We demonstrate here that a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) based delivery system encapsulating tumor antigen (OVA) and the TLR9 agonist CpG motif DNA administered into the tumor microenvironment initiates an effective type 1 mediated (IFN-γ producing) anti-tumor response in a syngeneic murine model of T cell lymphoma (E.G7-OVA). Although E.G7-OVA tumors spontaneously generate antigen specific CTLs in draining lymph nodes (LN), tumors progress rapidly. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment via local PLGA based therapy led to the generation of a systemic antigen specific Th1 response, absent in the non-polymer delivery method, subsequently associated with reduced tumor growth and prolongation of survival. These studies provide further insight into the use of a PLGA-based therapeutic approach at modulating the tumor microenvironment and highlight the need for analyzing the treatment effects in a tumor bearing model.","inCitations":["8d16e751ae291fadb3b6a02a1dbd1f8a0e868500","85e79d606a12bf12d49487194638e8a0c93e53af","5f030ce799e20c0489c02ff4a0479b32d93a66eb","358a19be38258a5694dc4cee2beb6cf10b2f65c4","52b195e21b0c2d4c608a3b11d2de64c53b3e5692"],"title":"PLGA-polymer encapsulating tumor antigen and CpG DNA administered into the tumor microenvironment elicits a systemic antigen-specific IFN-γ response and enhances survival.","doi":"10.4236/jct.2013.41035"}

We also describe a novel sol particle-trypsin assay using conjugates of gold nanoparticles with trypsin. The method is based on measuring spectral extinction changes caused by the addition of protein to a conjugate solution.

However, the images obtained from these devices have low resolution (LR) and poor quality that may not be suitable for retinal disease diagnosis. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework for the super-resolution (SR) of the LR fundus images. The method takes into consideration the diagnostic information in the fundus images during the SR process. In this work, SR is performed on the zone of interest of the fundus images. Clinical information of the selected zone is captured using the Shannon entropy, the contrast sensitivity index (CSI), the multi-resolution (MR) intra-band energy and the MR inter-band eigen features. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to decide the clinical significance of the zone. Highly accurate learning based SR method or the bicubic interpolation is applied to the selected zone based on the classification output. The method is tested on the Standard Diabetic Retinopathy Database Calibration level 1 (DIARETDB1) and the Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) databases. Classification accuracy of 85.22% and 85.77% is achieved for the DIARETDB1 and DRIVE databases respectively. The SR performance of the algorithm is quantified in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and computational time. The proposed diagnostic information based SR achieves computational time efficiency without compromising with the high resolution (HR) reconstruction accuracy of the fundus image zones.","inCitations":["4ad0a37218dbcd407f7943e939a5391a37062870"],"title":"A novel diagnostic information based framework for super-resolution of retinal fundus images","doi":"10.1016/j.compmedimag.2019.01.002"}

In a related research, it is argued that one of the basic elements for this variation is due to student’s distinct learning styles. Planning learning situations based on the knowledge of learners’ learning styles can be more effective and efficient. With the learning-teaching process designed in accordance with the learning styles of students, it is possible to develop positive attitudes towards the courses and to increase academic success. Pre-service teachers' awareness of their own learning styles can be effective both for their own development during their pre-service training and for the development of their students during their in-service professional career. The purpose of the current study is to determine the learning styles of the pre-service basic education teachers and to examine the relationships between their learning styles and gender, age, program type, grade level and grade point average. In data collection, the Kolb Learning Style Inventory was used. The current study was conducted on 493 pre-service teachers randomly selected from among the 1st, 2nd and 3rd year students attending the Basic Education Departments of Classroom Teaching and Pre-school Teacher Education in the Education Faculty of Necmettin Erbakan University, in 2017/2018 academic year. In the analysis of the collected data, SPSS 24 program package was used. The pre-service teachers’ learning styles are presented through descriptive statistics, frequencies (f) and percentages (%). Whether the pre-service teachers’ learning styles vary significantly depending on the variables of gender, age, program type, grade level and grade point average was tested with Chi-Square Test. Of the participating pre-service teachers, 398 (80.7%) are females and 95 (19.3%) are males; 250 (50.7%) are from the department of classroom teaching and 243 (49.3%) are from the department of pre-school teacher education. The results of the current study have revealed that the participating pre-service teachers have adopted the “Diverging” learning style to the greatest extent and the “Converging” learning style to the smallest extent. \n \n   \n \n Key words: Basic education, student, learning styles, variables, evaluation.","inCitations":["2e452fc0509a3b950d07375bd086ee717e12b691"],"title":"An investigation of pre-service basic education teachers learning styles in terms of different variables","doi":"10.5897/ERR2019.3687"}

However, because of its effects on non-immune bystander cells, poly(I:C) administration may bear danger for the development of autoimmune diseases. Thus poly(I:C) should be applied in the lowest dose possible. We investigated microspheres carrying surface-assembled poly(I:C) as a two-in-one adjuvant formulation to stimulate maturation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). Negatively charged polystyrene microspheres were equipped with a poly(ethylene glycol) corona through electrostatically driven surface assembly of a library of polycationic poly(l-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers, PLL-g-PEG. Stable surface assembly of poly(I:C) was achieved by incubation of polymer-coated microspheres in an aqueous poly(I:C) solution. Surface-assembled poly(I:C) exhibited a strongly enhanced efficacy to stimulate maturation of MoDCs by up to two orders of magnitude, as compared to free poly(I:C). Multiple phagocytosis events were the key factor to enhance the efficacy. The cytokine secretion pattern of MoDCs after exposure to surface-assembled poly(I:C) differed from that of free poly(I:C), while their ability to stimulate T cell proliferation was similar. Overall, phagocytic signaling plays an important role in defining the resulting immune response to such two-in-one adjuvant formulations.","inCitations":["5a363201f53385dd300c533df4c4daac8ff070ff","55be0244a666eda6726f2f013ba7fcb2bb5bc0a7","9152fdb20fdeb6f39763d9dc90cbcb3153e21dc4","547f6093aba993d170a048926f25e3e73729099e","05a94a6ac03012d6877919e9c58185ba87199ac0","9851892a2675ff9d589c4df23ca57622d554f885","f2347cbcd61875de0bc7848a57ba9fc83655e827","f6e6283e6c43c9ad6696d3de6eb27407710bb4d5","eddb422cee0185e9869a71d3f0ddab229fce8e84","3c7ae6a72850399a4db8c4c8531b6d9e39ab84ef","01f80d4a10deb9fe414759c14d9f4707d36eeb25","d5f82b9bc153732f86b1b9aa1c9c0049ee2aab1b","003f5701b3d6f0bf46efa5d36db8be5ab78fc2f8","38ef0dfdff6232cda35ae1e22fc5c668d1863049"],"title":"Tuning the immune response of dendritic cells to surface-assembled poly(I:C) on microspheres through synergistic interactions between phagocytic and TLR3 signaling.","doi":"10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.021"}

All the cationic detergents studied are very effective inhibitors of bacterial metabolism at 1:3000 concentration, and several are equally active at 1:30,000. Few of the anionic detergents inhibit as effectively as the cationic compounds. 2. Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms are equally sensitive to the action of the cationic detergents. On the other hand, all the anionic detergents included in our studies selectively inhibit the metabolism of Gram-positive microorganisms. 3. The inhibitory action of both types of detergents is influenced markedly by hydrogen ion concentration. Cationic detergents exhibit their maximum activity in the alkaline pH range, and the anionic, in the acid range. 4. Studies of homologous series of straight chain alkyl sulfates and sulfoacetates (C(8) to C(18)) demonstrate that maximum inhibition is exerted by the 12, 14, and 16 carbon compounds (lauryl, myristyl, and cetyl). 5. It has been observed that three lauryl esters of amino acids are powerful inhibitors of bacterial metabolism. To our knowledge, the effects on bacterial metabolism of such cationic detergents (without the quaternary ammonium structure) have not been studied previously. Our results demonstrate that other cationic detergents can exhibit an inhibitory activity comparable to quaternary ammonium compounds. 6. Certain detergents stimulate bacterial metabolism at concentrations lower than the inhibiting values. This effect has been found more frequently among the anionic detergents.","inCitations":["e53c2614c7edbb64e8b0ad6a42462c062a3f12fb","e1795a1f1ad47602fbda1590a3b56a08d2026274","1eedf97e46b8acd420ecb68ec2550ed137ca57fc","366ec9ce2d59054e6b0b9a53e78e4a3e567344d8","295f2202dacdbfde1b7bf11423ae2e31c61738d3","2b90cfb11303aeb779d57ab828f183a983485d27","f5210e0d95adb63d76772f83f713abfa5b9bb5e6","a13c72e9f0be15a56b8ed89fd9e8d415f4606092","ec96ff1d2011df88797895aba48c1f289f02f1b4","eaa6b447eb286eb7d1515ee121b06bb11c3984a6","52db995c72a446d45cf39227aa2d20e85b088270","7b9c7b0432ca215e0113bed315d7230ac0cf9a8e","b011eccde635a5fff06627304882a6454185babc","0f5e546a778dad3f0dbe89b16995e02efef78d0b","16c844bcbacb549ae5e9db169673cc69e528dbbc","7b184b3f97d917868268a21eeffa3caea0e84cd8","234eab16269e27d297bf06ee6ff554d44e982168","de301f3e76e61ec56e782458141f54d2981f9af7","694aef8cb50c2d449ef3b5b3f58c1fd6c86b66d1","8b1902ecb27705712f511f306057b57868a1cefc","1851993200a31460030400c9752c0b62afbc4ee8","dee1ad289604b325f365cfc98e2a41e7b61e13f8","e238a8ce471cb57443737f07a7763c94f2560484","5f33eb23610b0a44e8513854d4ca77f88b50d0d7","7ea8bc1b0f413da61b6d6133c51a2569ea878b73"],"title":"Action of Synthetic Detergents on the Metabolism of Bacteria","doi":"10.1084/jem.73.2.249"}

The goal is to minimize the number of distinct measurements (array movements) needed to localize objects such as buried landmines. The adaptive localization algorithm has been tested using data collected in a laboratory facility. The performance of the algorithm is exhibited for cases with one or two targets and in the presence of common types of clutter such as rocks in the soil. Results are also shown for a case where the propagation properties of the medium vary spatially. In these tests, the landmines were located using three or four array movements.

{"fieldsOfStudy":["Economics"],"year":2001,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"Abstract Previously, in several papers and textbooks, the classical economic order quantity (EOQ) and the economic production quantity (EPQ) formulas for the shortage case, have been derived using differential calculus and solving two simultaneous equations (derived from setting the two first partial derivatives to zero) with the need to prove optimality conditions with second-order derivatives. In a previous original piece of work, a new approach to find the EOQ with backlogging using some slight algebraic developments appeared. This paper extends the mentioned algebraic approach to the EPQ formula taking shortages into consideration within the case of only one backlog cost per unit and time unit. The final expressions provide the same formulas that are available in the classic textbooks on inventory theory.","inCitations":["7c8ffc5a9667dead82918c5e7faff0c493cb367a","0df0840a24f0bfc3ad54e4e74b93884c1692a36c","5a6cda5867a8f89ebd4f7e3977d8b308f99d95b6","481700026561028374d7a83f6e8bb389cdc1e4a1","2c98ae3f13837bf9c204cd84624fcbc8d801ac78","e307d0dcc598e059498171ca7c189193ad85e50d","1232c45e1896f43138d2343eabaa5f7bf04ca5c0","942f27806da68805a56bdd6260a908a2a76d650d","912fbba9077e521ffd8f3e3f19e2f525e5cecb92","554371e7a35594dee2be9dc198bae01175962515","2dec8076913f5bfe0be6def7449a1e1bdccfbc1c","895a7b0a074f1636000849bbb8aa3e9c8023c6f1","ff30fb9844f17e8a0f1a790550a1e0324041a9b5","6245f3a05ff018379c3cf9b23fac985640858a03","e9726b1bc3bf43a51481a6595ba07839f28ade6c","2d00d7429eb774d490460eb12b6b135dc4d7e6f2","4cc49b3903ca15c9b0b766aae900414ddc61f921","80576d4288e98a3ba11be23ad0ba47564a59beda","f52afbbbe3dbededfb15f4261961b5eb364eaaf5","736bdd7c9e7654e2bf91cf42d2b4b81919ca2a7d","24a20c19588381f8bd4881507f9d27ab3e6f0803","a195e7ce78fdae43c85c503d7c798a12fc2ed02a","17d813ef232b4fa21a88e4fd557fbaa5bf5c8aed","41c1027093194f5fc2dada8860a21d277cd1abd4","4305a9c643547bfbd9911f12a1bd5618dcde0adc","5291d9ed8a7bd21878974cc20e40fd6cb6bfb060","8918e721aade03f170b7e026068c768a580c58a2","3dbc10d8426a64eb9c64f6458f5e8f8598ee6464","89a15c8cdc9941fc79e1aadc9d060267e12f6c1c","3b1a6d71c1569b0193d483fcbb1053efe1b7714a","63fbfb27d321851c1efae3e2df5380f035f29346","3a6e4219459642d30b893d4dd3a0681a81f74a43","8c8028dd2a3464ed5ed82df3d3486b13adcb51e9","938efa87f378c83be663e140891923010cb383aa","df3b295cef0b69ed98cfee3599adfff55c754cec","523a790ea59a4b845606702ec512986afd742eda","8f17a3f4ea6166e644a3b0e1bc3a0b426b9fab04","e1276a7672d2856d8d65a87a64861c3a20a4a5b5","d7ea09b34578f03224f4ae23838b2fc675d92927","700663edf013c57850bd0a45212cebf9d8a625e5","9bd7c02c73ac933f528aa3644df3ed3b6e09a2d2","2d0ab1812d5371561bc733745788a46b0e438616","bd91b8c7c2ee6e96d375c2692824d9c204de4f8d","c265227c87f2a5e6832f0005e6f5945c975fc2c1","14a32f2c9b2f51c36da6b5ce916d985e29705878","94081cd64205bf33028293a264e650c6473d9240","74211b0f97096dfa98dba1dedabd2e854632d91a","ba09576053556259b6396413eba62556ec9cb723","71da23160659fb4e291396555a7e688a3ede9e47","9d01d89c20c7f9e4569abf6e0a8e960f053da0d8","671b606f5a9e15c580dc1b9c53459e35220cd058","8b3e8ce00d16b09805df044d62d4a051964b4a97","55bdf275ba936ed6bd18920df66ccfc9a71fc789","5c6c14f0f629bc0b628dcbc9f274d36e3851afc2","5928e222dfeda5005fa88e2133ac3c34a5fd8544","ac1ffb680008df5b1d056d97c9abab3bac56fd53","d4c4991ae1f9e5e7fda5f960d34fb9a06ae22435","ea01d30a7cf0e36b81d1ce2639b3d01b0f09ec77","164c25fd20ee382199576e1f33fb44d4c05ca422","6b67998b9c065cfd3ae76b42c1a1471d20454329","e5f5495c712c49faf2102ddf4f35c63175cdf291","12d252903be7c9265c01943171978370c73b29ea","b652a53d5acf72c2641d8d367e0b4bc3ce3ec6f8","4193beb03dd233decb49a181823e624362bf85ce","185a6ee20a55a5a0ca8f26016f6ff8da9cc7654a","13a6e603345399f16a7a8d5566552ae8e546c468","d5eb3dd786b501a847a76201238d4cbf869170c4","88a2d86a0526baeb18c51f879b5830c3fc2c4ee1","a01fc749c0b5dc84170a00d3a5cde74e0e5f444f","30c3d873484c6ef0e2b7137fe2ec9586a9ba3af4","35dbf9d489567960388d2056401ffd95cbd4590a","86e0a391855f17e5b9356898cd52f3a18dfd6a3b","86f53bbef7dbfd95d24804a14ddf6533e9db7f6e","05f1e48a3d0cf11a154107244d01c5906d684257","e838076a41597fe5a7b46018bb64a7bd02e0d6d1","542fe9601887b62e61b05bbb9853ccdabda93cb3","6c36770dacd63ae9917f24e1d52152cba932896c","72620bc003dc94080a621bcbdea3f12f258c6b59","f82fe3940c185661ce7102b3e5eb120d00311ed9","75268cfc696f83b98ec0e9ebd95a39665ef6be66","c3d15004d485382c5f03ca5f9a914030e5b34f0e"],"title":"The economic production quantity (EPQ) with shortage derived algebraically","doi":"10.1016/S0925-5273(00)00068-2"}
{"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics"],"year":2005,"outCitations":[],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"Mathematics and art are related endeavors? The view of most people is that art and mathematics could not be more different. One is left brain, the other right brain. One is creative, the other analytical. While this prevailing view is a partial truth, what mathematician has not marveled at the beauty of an elegant proof, and what serious artist has not been aware of the importance of form and composition to a successful art work? Both disciplines are creative endeavors with analytical components that are essential elements of contemporary civilization. Here, we hope to make the case that, like the yin/yang symbol, art and mathematics are really one in two, and two in one. Here, we will discuss some of the ways that mathematics and art are both similar and different; how they express complementary aspects of life and culture; and how they both share a fundamental unity on a deeper level. Mathematics can indeed be defined as the general science of pattern and structure. Because art also involves patterns and structures, art and math relate to each other in many natural ways, which is the basis for this exploration. This exploration has also produced collaborations with artists working with mathematical themes and has coincided with several recent art exhibitions in Colorado. These art exhibitions have been exploring the idea that art and mathematics are intimately related on a deeper level. We will also discuss some recent Colorado art exhibitions that provide good examples of how the collaboration between mathematics and art has found public expression.","inCitations":["bd479c7fb36df13abbd2b6812df3a539c7d2a500","337223ae27d038f8034eb497fc0194fe3ca1d0ed"],"title":"One in Two, Two in One: Mathematics and the Arts","doi":"10.1080/10724117.2005.12021799"}
