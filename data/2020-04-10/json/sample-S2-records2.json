However, the images obtained from these devices have low resolution (LR) and poor quality that may not be suitable for retinal disease diagnosis. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework for the super-resolution (SR) of the LR fundus images. The method takes into consideration the diagnostic information in the fundus images during the SR process. In this work, SR is performed on the zone of interest of the fundus images. Clinical information of the selected zone is captured using the Shannon entropy, the contrast sensitivity index (CSI), the multi-resolution (MR) intra-band energy and the MR inter-band eigen features. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to decide the clinical significance of the zone. Highly accurate learning based SR method or the bicubic interpolation is applied to the selected zone based on the classification output. The method is tested on the Standard Diabetic Retinopathy Database Calibration level 1 (DIARETDB1) and the Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) databases. Classification accuracy of 85.22% and 85.77% is achieved for the DIARETDB1 and DRIVE databases respectively. The SR performance of the algorithm is quantified in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and computational time. The proposed diagnostic information based SR achieves computational time efficiency without compromising with the high resolution (HR) reconstruction accuracy of the fundus image zones.","inCitations":["4ad0a37218dbcd407f7943e939a5391a37062870"],"title":"A novel diagnostic information based framework for super-resolution of retinal fundus images","doi":"10.1016/j.compmedimag.2019.01.002"}

We demonstrate an adaptive system that moves an array of receivers according to an optimal positioning algorithm that is based on the theory of optimal experiments. The goal is to minimize the number of distinct measurements (array movements) needed to localize objects such as buried landmines. The adaptive localization algorithm has been tested using data collected in a laboratory facility. The performance of the algorithm is exhibited for cases with one or two targets and in the presence of common types of clutter such as rocks in the soil. Results are also shown for a case where the propagation properties of the medium vary spatially. In these tests, the landmines were located using three or four array movements. It is envisioned that future systems could incorporate this new method into a portable mobile mine-location system","inCitations":["e2d68b83182da250c733d62a9c18ccac42cb5683","08b86210b50c6ccfaaeabef2c214f063e8e2f6c2","118962c9c44e40c8a3686a73daf124fb3251fbd0","114fe632f8026601c298956977512e9d56a988df","dd95c18753632150ae80688118efa321125ba923","2924aac516d54e7f490ca6cdbb2a9f1808738e66","56f58c63510be06d2f8b34cd0bb407c5ac7585a6"],"title":"Optimal Maneuvering of Seismic Sensors for Localization of Subsurface Targets","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.894551"}

In a previous original piece of work, a new approach to find the EOQ with backlogging using some slight algebraic developments appeared. This paper extends the mentioned algebraic approach to the EPQ formula taking shortages into consideration within the case of only one backlog cost per unit and time unit. The final expressions provide the same formulas that are available in the classic textbooks on inventory theory.","inCitations":["7c8ffc5a9667dead82918c5e7faff0c493cb367a","0df0840a24f0bfc3ad54e4e74b93884c1692a36c","5a6cda5867a8f89ebd4f7e3977d8b308f99d95b6","481700026561028374d7a83f6e8bb389cdc1e4a1","2c98ae3f13837bf9c204cd84624fcbc8d801ac78","e307d0dcc598e059498171ca7c189193ad85e50d","1232c45e1896f43138d2343eabaa5f7bf04ca5c0","942f27806da68805a56bdd6260a908a2a76d650d","912fbba9077e521ffd8f3e3f19e2f525e5cecb92","554371e7a35594dee2be9dc198bae01175962515","2dec8076913f5bfe0be6def7449a1e1bdccfbc1c","895a7b0a074f1636000849bbb8aa3e9c8023c6f1","ff30fb9844f17e8a0f1a790550a1e0324041a9b5","6245f3a05ff018379c3cf9b23fac985640858a03","e9726b1bc3bf43a51481a6595ba07839f28ade6c","2d00d7429eb774d490460eb12b6b135dc4d7e6f2","4cc49b3903ca15c9b0b766aae900414ddc61f921","80576d4288e98a3ba11be23ad0ba47564a59beda","f52afbbbe3dbededfb15f4261961b5eb364eaaf5","736bdd7c9e7654e2bf91cf42d2b4b81919ca2a7d","24a20c19588381f8bd4881507f9d27ab3e6f0803","a195e7ce78fdae43c85c503d7c798a12fc2ed02a","17d813ef232b4fa21a88e4fd557fbaa5bf5c8aed","41c1027093194f5fc2dada8860a21d277cd1abd4","4305a9c643547bfbd9911f12a1bd5618dcde0adc","5291d9ed8a7bd21878974cc20e40fd6cb6bfb060","8918e721aade03f170b7e026068c768a580c58a2","3dbc10d8426a64eb9c64f6458f5e8f8598ee6464","89a15c8cdc9941fc79e1aadc9d060267e12f6c1c","3b1a6d71c1569b0193d483fcbb1053efe1b7714a","63fbfb27d321851c1efae3e2df5380f035f29346","3a6e4219459642d30b893d4dd3a0681a81f74a43","8c8028dd2a3464ed5ed82df3d3486b13adcb51e9","938efa87f378c83be663e140891923010cb383aa","df3b295cef0b69ed98cfee3599adfff55c754cec","523a790ea59a4b845606702ec512986afd742eda","8f17a3f4ea6166e644a3b0e1bc3a0b426b9fab04","e1276a7672d2856d8d65a87a64861c3a20a4a5b5","d7ea09b34578f03224f4ae23838b2fc675d92927","700663edf013c57850bd0a45212cebf9d8a625e5","9bd7c02c73ac933f528aa3644df3ed3b6e09a2d2","2d0ab1812d5371561bc733745788a46b0e438616","bd91b8c7c2ee6e96d375c2692824d9c204de4f8d","c265227c87f2a5e6832f0005e6f5945c975fc2c1","14a32f2c9b2f51c36da6b5ce916d985e29705878","94081cd64205bf33028293a264e650c6473d9240","74211b0f97096dfa98dba1dedabd2e854632d91a","ba09576053556259b6396413eba62556ec9cb723","71da23160659fb4e291396555a7e688a3ede9e47","9d01d89c20c7f9e4569abf6e0a8e960f053da0d8","671b606f5a9e15c580dc1b9c53459e35220cd058","8b3e8ce00d16b09805df044d62d4a051964b4a97","55bdf275ba936ed6bd18920df66ccfc9a71fc789","5c6c14f0f629bc0b628dcbc9f274d36e3851afc2","5928e222dfeda5005fa88e2133ac3c34a5fd8544","ac1ffb680008df5b1d056d97c9abab3bac56fd53","d4c4991ae1f9e5e7fda5f960d34fb9a06ae22435","ea01d30a7cf0e36b81d1ce2639b3d01b0f09ec77","164c25fd20ee382199576e1f33fb44d4c05ca422","6b67998b9c065cfd3ae76b42c1a1471d20454329","e5f5495c712c49faf2102ddf4f35c63175cdf291","12d252903be7c9265c01943171978370c73b29ea","b652a53d5acf72c2641d8d367e0b4bc3ce3ec6f8","4193beb03dd233decb49a181823e624362bf85ce","185a6ee20a55a5a0ca8f26016f6ff8da9cc7654a","13a6e603345399f16a7a8d5566552ae8e546c468","d5eb3dd786b501a847a76201238d4cbf869170c4","88a2d86a0526baeb18c51f879b5830c3fc2c4ee1","a01fc749c0b5dc84170a00d3a5cde74e0e5f444f","30c3d873484c6ef0e2b7137fe2ec9586a9ba3af4","35dbf9d489567960388d2056401ffd95cbd4590a","86e0a391855f17e5b9356898cd52f3a18dfd6a3b","86f53bbef7dbfd95d24804a14ddf6533e9db7f6e","05f1e48a3d0cf11a154107244d01c5906d684257","e838076a41597fe5a7b46018bb64a7bd02e0d6d1","542fe9601887b62e61b05bbb9853ccdabda93cb3","6c36770dacd63ae9917f24e1d52152cba932896c","72620bc003dc94080a621bcbdea3f12f258c6b59","f82fe3940c185661ce7102b3e5eb120d00311ed9","75268cfc696f83b98ec0e9ebd95a39665ef6be66","c3d15004d485382c5f03ca5f9a914030e5b34f0e"],"title":"The economic production quantity (EPQ) with shortage derived algebraically","doi":"10.1016/S0925-5273(00)00068-2"}

The view of most people is that art and mathematics could not be more different. One is left brain, the other right brain. One is creative, the other analytical. While this prevailing view is a partial truth, what mathematician has not marveled at the beauty of an elegant proof, and what serious artist has not been aware of the importance of form and composition to a successful art work? Both disciplines are creative endeavors with analytical components that are essential elements of contemporary civilization. Here, we hope to make the case that, like the yin/yang symbol, art and mathematics are really one in two, and two in one. Here, we will discuss some of the ways that mathematics and art are both similar and different; how they express complementary aspects of life and culture; and how they both share a fundamental unity on a deeper level. Mathematics can indeed be defined as the general science of pattern and structure. Because art also involves patterns and structures, art and math relate to each other in many natural ways, which is the basis for this exploration. This exploration has also produced collaborations with artists working with mathematical themes and has coincided with several recent art exhibitions in Colorado. These art exhibitions have been exploring the idea that art and mathematics are intimately related on a deeper level. We will also discuss some recent Colorado art exhibitions that provide good examples of how the collaboration between mathematics and art has found public expression.","inCitations":["bd479c7fb36df13abbd2b6812df3a539c7d2a500","337223ae27d038f8034eb497fc0194fe3ca1d0ed"],"title":"One in Two, Two in One: Mathematics and the Arts","doi":"10.1080/10724117.2005.12021799"}
